Before these 6600XTs, I had 3 Nvidia cards in a row and I can say that they feel as stable as Nvidia cards. Maybe overclocking, undervolting and tweaking in general I would give an edge to Nvidia.

It would blackscreen and restart my computer multiple times a day, and many posters would say that my 750w platinum rated PSU was the issue (lol). Along with countless other \"fixes\", OS wipes, drivers with DDU, etc.\n\nSo what did I do? I bought the highest rated power supply I could find at microcenter, wiped my OS, and it still failed. Fine. Maybe my motherboard has issues with the card. I built a second computer out of older parts and that power supply and guess what, it still failed. At this point, I have tried multiple hw configs, drivers, and countless OS wipes. At one point, an AMD employee recruited me to a dev discord and sent me new drivers and tools to record the issue. This went on for a few months but no beta driver helped me. To note, so many people on the two subs were having these exact issues - this was not an isolated issue.\n\nAbout 3 months later, I RMA the card to powercolor, who after 2 weeks, they find 0 issues with it. I get it back, furious, so I forgo ever putting it back into a system, and sell it at a good price with an obvious caution \"had issues with it, but Powercolor says there is nothing wrong with it\".\n\nI buy a 2070 super and have had 0 issues. No reboots, no black screens, no crashes, artifacts, anything ever. It's been about 6 months since then. I sincerely hope the person who bought that card has had 0 issues with it. I still love AMD as a company, but the entire experience left a terrible taste in my mouth because nobody took blame for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I now realize that I haven't posted since swapped cards, I still have the 5700xt as my flair lol.",

      "Every single driver released since May is completely unable to properly render Motion Smoothing for ANYONE, an essential effect in some highly demanding VR games.

    "selftext": "AMD have given an MSRP on this card and promised a few things--\n\n1.) $199 MSRP (actual available price targeted)\n\n2.) Large available quantity at launch.  Lisa Su:\n\n>We’re positioning the launch such that—and I know, you guys always say, ’Well, yeah, they’re just saying that’—but we really are positioning the launch at a $199 price point. It is sort of affordable to the mainstream. You know, we intend to have a lot of product out there.\n\n3.) Its no good for mining and according to AMD, that was an intentional part of the design.\n\nNumber 3 above is key.  If this is true (and it will be tested, I can assure you), then miners wont be buying truckloads of them-- they shouldnt actually be buying any at all.  Again, this means that anyone selling these tomorrow at above MSRP are outright scalping /scalpers.  In normal times, this is a $160 card, at best.  Its gimped in mem capacity, gimped in hardware video codecs, gimped in PCIe lanes/bandwidth.  Consider that if you are thinking of caving in and paying more than $200.  Dont do it.\n\nIf you purchase one of these cards for anything more than a penny over $200 USD, you are supporting  and encouraging scalping, period.  This should not be able to be blamed on miners. Do not pay more than that at Amazon, Newegg, Best Buy, Microcenter, etc, and for DAMNED SURE do not pay more than that on Ebay or some hardware swap forum.\n\nShow some backbone and say no to scalping once and for all.  Make the scalpers who purchased multiple cards with the intent of flipping them sell for a loss.  Send a message to the AIBs that its not OK to upcharge 50% of what a product should cost just because they slap a \"superclocked\" or \"OC edition\" label on it. If the community doesnt unite and take a stand against this BS it will never stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*EDIT:  There are already some people trying to justify higher prices by saying that \"Oh, the AIB versions will have a bigger cooler, etc, so they will be more expensive.\"  BULLSHIT.  AIB cards are the only ones that are being sold and Lisa's comments about targeted street price of $200 already take this into account.  That means that AMD has sold these GPUs to AIBs at a low enough price that $200 should cover everything else they need to produce the card and still make a profit.  Dont fall for that BS.  This is a tiny die, on a tiny card, with a tiny amount of memory.  It doesnt need a  triple fan Arctic Frozr cooler or some exotic liquid cooling shit on it, dont be that gullible.**",

      "People should also note here, this card is not worth MSRP, let alone above it, it has been gimped in too many ways, (Not to prevent mining, so they can cut costs producing it and increase the margin on it), AMD saying its to prevent mining is a PR stunt, nothing more (Unless someone fancies telling me how gimping the PCIE lanes and memory bus also help 'prevent mining' when the 4gb vram is already in place)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are a gamer on a budget (Which realisitcally if you're looking at this card, you are), don't bother, get a current generation console. These are easier to buy than GPUs, are more powerful than this GPU, and will cost less (Comparing total system cost).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point of the PC platform is to give a premium experience over consoles for a premium price, this card represents a premium price for a worse experience \n\nYou aren't really getting the freedom of framerate and resolution here, even settings tweaks really, and you're below the XSX/PS5 performance tier so what's the point in buying it more than those systems cost",
      "Supposedly somewhere around RX 580-ish.",
      "Even MSRP seems like too much honestly. Unless they can get it to run at full speed at PCI-E 3.0 x4 and is meaningfully faster than the 5500 XT, this card is going to be terrible at 200, but with how messed up the market it, I'm sure it will sold out even at 400."

If the 6500 XT wasn't so gimped or the 3050 was priced accordingly, this would be a completely different conversation.  \n\n\nWelcome to 2022, where \"best value\" basically means \"this purchase will dick you over the ***least ...*** but it will still give you the D.\"  Fingers crossed that Intel releases a reasonably priced budget card.",

Both the 3060 and 3060ti cost a lot more. The market changes and so most the perspective of reviewers. \n\nI would like to get a high end GPU for 350CHF (like my r9 fury), but it will take a lot of time for that to happen.",

Significant adjustments in retail pricing aside, the RX 6600 is still an expensive 5600 XT with shitty ray tracing performance, while the second thumbnail is now correct, dropping to $450 US makes it the best value GPU in the current market.\n\nUpon release the RX 6600 didn't look impressive, pricing didn't sound as though it was going to be remotely interesting and it wasn't, so what did you want the thumbnail to say? \"The probably crap value RX 6600 is here?\"",

      "Except the 6600 and 6600 XT were both called bad value cards at launch by most reviewers, so them being bad cards as a result was indeed part of most of the launch reviews of those GPUs. It's only more recently that reviewers who shit on the 6600 XT are having second thoughts about it.",

Micro Center had plenty available near MSRP, even had cards left at the end of the day. \n\nHowever, there is no guarantee this will continue to be the case in terms of both quantity and pricing. In fact, the pattern from the 3060 and 6700xt launches were that they had cards near MSRP on launch day but almost only expensive ones later on. Given that even the 6700xt is selling for $800+ from most board partners, I would not be shocked at 6600xt going above $600-650. \n\nWith all the reviewers’ complaints about the $379 MSRP, they forget that getting this card actually at $379 is an absolute bargain in this market, and probably only likely to happen on launch day. The correct advise to their audience should have been to get one at MSRP on launch day if at all possible and just sell your RX580 or GTX 1060.",

There may be some GPU performance impact depending on the connector but it's so small you won't notice it anyway.\n\nEdit: for my own anecdote, I'm running a reference 6900XT and a corsair RM 850x that comes with daisy chain connectors. The wire from the PSU to the first connector is much higher gauge than the chained connector.\n\nI have no performance difference using either 2 separate 8-pin or a single daisy chain. The heat in the wire measured 1 degree higher which is not much and within error of the indirect thermometer I was using.\n\nSo it really depends on the PSU and again, I doubt any PSU maker would risk the liability of not having more than adequate daisy connectors."

AMD keeps shitting on the $200 market and has done so for the past few generations; no Vega model, RX 5500XT, and now the RX 6500.   It's sad when a 5-6 year old card outperforms a brand new offering that should blow it out of the water.",

Your flair says you already have a 6700XT so really it won't affect you, just like 99.95% of commenters shitting on it that will never own one any way, this isn't aimed at ANY OF US it's just to get more cards out the door in shitty bottom barrel prebuilts, and NOBODY buying one of those is seriously contemplating \"streaming\".",
      "The issue is, if someone is buying a '$200\" GPU they likely have a really old, slow performing CPU. People aren't going to pair these with a modern Zen 3 or 12th gen CPU, but likely a 5+ year old budget one.\n\nSo it absolutely becomes an issue.",

      "The explanation I have seen is that both the x4 interface and the lack of hardware encoding is because it's a notebook GPU repurposed for desktop. Notebooks don't need a hardware encoder on the GPU because the iGPU already have one, and they use PCI-E x4.",

      "I don’t understand how 3050 prices have stayed so elevated as everything else drops, the cheapest on Newegg is $330. That’s arguably even worse value than a $200 6500XT.\n\nMeanwhile the friend I just helped build is very satisfied with his $250 6600.",
      "the 6600 & 6600XT are pretty much the default choice for 1080p gaming right now, unless you can get a 3060Ti for around the same price as the former two cards.",
      "If you did the numbers at the MSRP, it's literally just a faster 6500xt. 20-30% faster for about 25% increased price. And that was *if* you could get it at Nvidia's MSRP, which we all know is a joke\n\nMeanwhile the 3060 and 6600 were practically 2 times more powerful for 50% increase in price. 3050 is genuinely a worthless card",
      "3060Ti could've been the people's card for this gen if not for fucking miners.",
      "I have a 3050. It lives in my unraid server and it transcodes plex and does some rendering work. It replaced a 1060 6gb with a net influx of 50 bucks in cash. So effectively a free upgrade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAMD didn't have anything that I could do this with. All their cards at that price range don't have proper encoders. OpenCL is also a joke and no proper rendering software really supports AMD over CUDA.\n\nThat's the realistic niche for this card. It's unfortunate AMD doesn't have much to compete with it.",
      "Yep the only thing new we learn from this video is that AMD card prices keep tanking even below MSRP and somehow 3050 prices still above MSRP. About the performance part from the moment they come out from all the review we already knew that 6600 1 tier above and closer to the 3060/3060Ti/6600xt (hence the name) than the 3050.",

It 'SHOULD' be a replacement for the 1650 Super in Nvidias product stack with similar performance but with RTX and DLSS features added (despite how fairly useless they may be in most games on this card, there are some low-demand games that will still work well with DLSS at 1080p like esports titles). \n\nBut at $300 it's ridiculous",
      "Mining is dead and nvidia cards still overly overpriced. RTX 3050 is 330€ for the most basic model, which is just absolutely nuts when you can buy RX 6600 for 300€. RTX 3060Ti is also pricy as hell here + it's quite power hungry for what it is which will start matter soon with skyrocketing electricity prices in Europe (which were already like double the US prices).",

      ">I don’t understand how 3050 prices have stayed so elevated as everything else drops\n\nI would guess that AIB's sold them to retailers for higher costs, and now since the crypto crash and with demand dropping out hard, retailers are hoping to not have to discount cards below what they paid for them, seeing if they can get some suckers to clear out what they have now.",

The only card I ever had issue with was a 7900 GT, that luckily I bought from EVGA, so it was a quick and easy RMA.\n\nI don't get the diehard siding with one brand over another. Each gen, I read reviews and chose the best bang for my budget. Sometimes its AMD and sometimes it is Nvidia.",

      "I think the problem with this comment is that you didn't mention how larger chips have a higher defective to functional dies ratio per wafer than smaller chips, rendering them more expensive, also you failed to mention that running this chip ant high power could potentially reduce its lifespan as it was made to be efficient at lower voltages and clocks, pushing it this high certainly requires relatively high voltages than what it was designed for, which could lead to chip degradation and failure. Given all that I'd say that it seldom balances out, as a larger die with more cores would give the same performance at a lower voltage compared to this laptop die which is being pushed beyond its efficiency sweet spot. Now while higher voltage doesn't always mean lesser lifespan, it does usually mean less power consumed, which is always nice, if we assume that both dies would pull the same amount of current to achieve their targeted performance.",

It is horribly crippled. But it is crucial to remember that every single component on the card is in short supply or overpriced, even the copper used in the PCB traces is up substantially. Shipping is up substantially. Inflation is up. The design costs for a 6nm part are massive. TSMC has also raised their prices. \n\nI cannot see how it could cost any less.\n\nThe best price NVIDIA can do is $250 on their RTX3050. That is less compromised but it's also more expensive.

And this thing - even though it is mid-tier - is a beast. It pulls FPS close to my friends 1080ti.",

The difference may improve more as Resizable Bar support improves, but even for now a good PCIe3 NVMe isn't much different for increased frames.\n\nPCIe Gen4 is being implemented now for increased storage speed, GPU's weren't at a bottleneck yet on PCIe3. Its only been an issue with newer x4 lane cards like the RX6400, which was more AMD using PCIe4's double the bandwidth to get away with releasing an x4 card.",

      "GPU utilization at 62% tells the story.  That card is not being pushed.",
      "That’s probably why, Tomb Raider isn’t going to stress out a GPU like that too much",
      "Are you capped at 60 fps?",
      "it's also at just 1100 MHz, which means lower power state, and even at that state only 62% of GPU time is used.",
      "This is correct.  Gpu is idling and saving power because it's capping at 60fps. Why frame capping or vsync is good for many games that don't need unlimited fps.",
      "Yeah",
      "That seems to be the consensus. I just switched from a 390 where I'm used to hitting 80c in Tomb Raider. A difference of -30c is baffling to me. Guess I'm not used to all the advances in the new cards. Cheers!",
      "Looks about right , your gpu util is only 60% so not even pushing the card. Plus 6600xt is a low wattage card.",
      "Time to swap back",
      "3 options:\n- Leave as-is, everything is fine\n- Up quality settings to utilize GPU more\n- Get a higher resolution and/or refresh rate monitor to utilize GPU more",
      "Thats one of the uses for vsync",
      "160W TDP doesn’t mean 160W in games at all times.",
      "We've come a long way that's for sure",
      "Lol no wonder then",
      "It's because the framerate is locked to 60fps, so the card and cpu doesn't need to push more.",
      "Correct me if I’m wrong, but high clock with low usages is not bad. \n\nHeat depends on load not clock. \n\nLook at CPU‘s. When you overclock your i9 to 5Ghz it’s not running at 90 Degrees all the time. \n\nAnd the clock is always more stable with low usage. Like you can boot with 5.2 into Windows but Prime is only stable with 5.\n\nI myself cap my FPS to stay in G-Sync range. \nNever had any problems. And GPU Temps are way lower.",
      "Look at the FPS number to see the whole story. OP has vsync on or has manually capped the FPS to 60. Unlock that cap, OP, and your GPU will stretch its legs.",
      "Well that answers your question. If you had the frame rate uncapped, then it would use more power to render more frames.",
      "Tip: 60 is divisible by 120 but not by 144, so if you're going to play at 60 fps you're better off setting that 144hz monitor to 120hz so 60 fps look smooth on it instead if stuttery. Nothing can be done about the resolution though, if it were 2160p you could use Integer Scaling to get 1080p at the same quality of a 1080p monitor, but 1440 isn't an integer number of 1080.\n\nRSR would be perfect for this though, but I doubt the 390 is going to get it. Maybe with modded drivers."

That’s quite a bit extra heat in the case in the first image and can definitely affect results. Of course a LM application should see lower temps regardless so nothing to really see here but not really a scientific process conducted here either.",
      "I thought about that too, but it takes literally seconds for your CPU to reach at least 80% of max temp during load, unless you have a very large cooler. He might just have run another program on the second pic.\n\nBut your theory could be correct as well. I'd just expect a higher CPU temp even for shorter benches.",
      "No idea why. Had the same background apps running. Just a spike I'd guess.\n\nEDIT: looking at that chart it looks like it was running something for at least a minute while taking that shot. Honestly don't know. Maybe Windows updates, or something else. But I don't think it effected GPU temps at all. The VRAM load is the same and they are both at 99% GPU load. Either way I'm not removing the LM to retest lol.",
      "You can run LM safely on a GPU if you know how to apply it correctly.\n\nI have ran and still do Thermal Grizzly Condactonout on all my Ryzen CPU's and Gpus, for years now perfectly fine.\n\nObviously it's not for everyone.",
      "I didn't say it took a few seconds to reach peak temp. I said you'll reach at least 80% of peak temp in a few seconds during load. For me it takes literally about 5 seconds to reach 85c on my CPU, it maxes out at 88C no matter how long I push it. It does however downclock about 100MHz after a while and stays that clock forever. But I have a weak cooler with exceptional fans, but they're loud as hell. With a larger cooler and weaker fans it'd take a bit longer to reach peak temperatures. The hotter the cooler/CPU gets the faster it'll disperse heat.\n\nNow I mainly reach 90% of my max temp in seconds due to PBO and a small cooler. But even using an I3 with a Noctua DH-15 will definitely net you 80% of peak temp after 30~ seconds stressing it.",

      "Fun Fact - Sony uses liquid metal on the PS5.",

      "There are lots of guides on LM - never use it with aluminum, nickel plated is best but it can work with copper as well in my experience with Thermal Grizzly Condactounaut. As it is not as reactive as some other brands.\n\nFor ex. - I've had it on a Noctua nh-d14 for 1.5years with the same exact temps. (on a Ryzen 2600)\n\nJust apply the correct amount properly. You can also install a small barrier of foam etc. around the cpu if you are paranoid of it leaking out. I never have and it has never 'leaked' for me anywhere.\n\n\nThe least reactive and most stable is Thermal Grizzly Condactonout.\n\n\nThat is all I've been using for last 5 years on all my cpu/gpus. 10/10 would recommend.",
      "I've got that card and 2k RPM doesn't sound bad at all, even considering you can only achieve that kind of fan speed with an overclock. Nice and quiet.",
      "Liquid metal can short circuit components, handle with care.",
      "Probably not. Runs cool enough already. I figured maybe lower temps would cause it to automatically boost higher, but not too a consistently measurable amount from what I can tell.",
      "My friend. The fucking graphs.",
      "It takes a bit of a while to actually hit peak temperatures. Usually takes my gpu and cpu about 20-30 minutes to hit an actual max temperature that's stabilized.\n\nThe first 5 minutes of your benchmarks mean jack shit because the cpu is still cold and going up in temps. It's kind of like putting a glass of cold water with ice in a room that's hot, obviously isn't gonna change much in a couple minutes.",
      "Same thing happens with my 5600x under Dark Rock 4. It hits peak temp ussualy 10sec after starting a MT test and holds that for a long time. It is called temp equilibrium, it's normal behavior. For some ppl it takes much longer because it all depends on what kind of cooler you have and how much air does your case push...\n\nAnyway, i do not recommend using liquid metal unless you (anyone) really knows what you are doing. LM can react with the aluminum in the cooler and you can easily end up with a dead Gpu... IMO, it is better/safer to use a high quality thermal paste like Thermal Grizzly..."

The second they got to within spitting distance of Nvidia's performance (a charitable assessment of their performance) they abandoned competitive pricing.\n\nAnyone who doesn't need a workstation computer or who isn't rich should forget PC gaming imho.

So now we have cards like this one, the 6700xt, 3070ti, (and to a lesser degree) 3060 with terrible MSRP.\n\nThese are going to go for above $500 anyway. MSRP just decides how much of that goes to the manufacturer.",

I even think the PCIE x8 lanes were a last minute decision to save costs just because they can nowadays.\n\nOf course, with demand outstripping supply and shipping costs and raw materials costs being what they are, if this is actually available at MSRP, it will be the best deal of the year.",

      "Depending on the benchmark/metric the 6500xt is 3-3.8x the performance of the Vega 8 on the Ryzen 5000 APUs or the GT 1030 DDR5.\n\nThe 6400 has the same memory bandwidth but 3/4 the CU's and a 15% lower clock.  **At worst it would still be** ~~2.25-2.9x~~ **1.9x-2.45x the performance of the 5000 iGPUs/GT 1030.**\n\nThe 6500xt is about 2.1x the performance of the 1050ti.  So the 6400 would be at worst ~~1.5x~~1.3x the 1050ti.\n\nConsidering people have been buying 1030's and 1050's for ridiculous prices (seen $130-$150 for the 1030), the 6400 (at an expected $150) isn't a terrible proposition.\n\nCould it be cheaper?  Sure.  Will it?  In time.  Is it a good GPU for playing newer AAA games? Oh hell no.  But it does quite well with a lot of games at 1080p and med to low settings.  Several times better than an iGPU for sure.\n\nEdit: the 6400 does have a 15% slower clock speed so adjust the numbers above accordingly.  So the 6400 becomes 1.9x to 2.45x  the performance of the Vega 8/GT1030.\n\nIt's still an upgrade for those on an iGPU for those that want to play older games or games with modest GPU requirements.\n\nEdit2: Best visualized with this relative GPU performance chart.

And here I can get it new for just a little cheaper than a 1650. Not a great deal, but everything else (new) looks like a worse deal. So it's actually kind of an ok card imo. In this shitty climate at least, if things get better, it's also gonna fall in price.\n\nI'd guess a 6400 would be somewhere around a 1050/1050ti.

      "Man I love this, I wish MXM was more accessible",
      "Got my hands on an MXM form factor RX 6600 and tore it down yesterday.\n\nWhat a lovely compact design using Micron GDDR6 (4x 16Gb modules), OnSemi power stages/voltage controllers, and high quality capacitors. Notes:\n\n- There are two NCP81022 4+1 voltage controllers with 10 phases in total (7 for VCore and 3 for GDDR6/SoC?)\n- Each phase is handled by an integrated OnSemi 55A power stage\n- VBios is set to 75W TDP, but I was able to push it past 130W with MorePowerTool and survive Furmark stress indefinitely. With the tiny heatsink, it matches my Desktop RX 6600 performance which has a 3X larger heatsink and two fans.\n- Curiously, there is no fan header on the board. Instead, the fan plugs into a host controller board on the other side of the MXM interface.\n- Manufacturer is Hightech (HIS)\n\nSo MXM is not dead yet....",

      "Nah, the government and some workstations still take this standard. Companies like Dell/Alienware used them up until 2014, clevo I believe still use a modified version of it that can be supplied their own power.\n\nPNY still designs GPUs for this form factor! It’s rare but you can find RTX 2060s and RTX 3000/4000/5000.\n\nI’m looking to get a GTX 1070 MXM in the next couple of months for my Alienware 17. Such a cool concept; too bad people want thin and light BGA crap",

    "selftext": "So I had the reference 5700 XT since launch for about 18 months. It served me ok, but the card would get so hot / loud (even tried an aftermark cooler) that I had to use it at about 90% of its clocks with some undervolting. Also had issues with HDMI audio that never got fixed (hw issue apparently). So while satisfied, I was eager to upgrade to RDNA2.\n\nThen the 6800 launched here in NZ for a reasonable price, I was even able to get it on \"special\". Powercolor Fighter, boy, this is the best GPU I've ever had. No RGB BS, ultra quiet, such a performer. With some undervolting (as my HTPC case isn't great), card used about 160-180W and you couldn't hear it. The \"useless\" 16GB of memory have seen up to 15GB used!!! when playing at 4k plus AA. Seriously, highly recommend.\n\nNow, I haven't been playing for months and such amazing card being idle was a discomfort to me. Decided to see for how much they were going - miners and all - and was surprised with what I saw. Long story short, sold it for \\~25% more than what I paid 7 months ago.\n\nOf course I had checked what was available - plenty of 6600 XT here for the same price 5700 XT were sold 2 years ago - so I grabbed one right away. XFX Speedster QUIK 308, screw RGB.\n\nComparison with 6800\n\n\\> testing here at 1080/1440p and it has between 65 and 75% of the 6800's performance, while costing 53% of that 6800's sale price. I'm happy. Noise wise, with overclocking and no undervolting (2750@1150mv and 2200+fast timings), it's maybe a notch above the awesome 6800 Fighter, but still a great and quiet card.\n\nComparison with 5700XT\n\nAs stated above, due to case constraints, the 6600XT is about 20-25% faster and MUCH quieter. The HDMI audio issue was fixed in the 6000 gen so there's that too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor overall desktop use and Youtube/Media Player Classic, this card is amazing. Fans always idle, uses so little power to play even 4k videos, just perfect.\n\nVery happy with my awesome HTPC card + single player gaming here and there.\n\n\\>>> Is it worth the upgrade from a 5700XT?\n\nYes, as 5700XT are going for crazy prices (mining) you may get a 6600XT for $0 or even make a profit",
    "comments": [
      "I've had my RX 5700 XT since November 2019, and despite some driver issues early on, it's worked pretty much perfectly for me. I admit I don't game a lot anymore though. I'm afraid to sell it in case I can't find anything to replace it with.",
      "I thought it is going to be something negative since most people post about problems.",
      "I've never felt such a strong connection to a card before. From 6200 OC, to 9800GT, to GTX 460, RX380, RX480, (5700XT here) and with the 3070 now. 5700XT was such a good card for the price. Definitely felt bad letting it go for ~$950 after my buddy snagged an extra 3070.",
      "Great to hear your experience with those 3 cards!",
      "nah it has been great on me, nothing to complain :)  \n\"oh but it's soooo expensive\", well, here in NZ a high end 6600 XT is going for \\~70 USD less than an entry level 3060 non TI",
      "hell you can get a 6700 xt with how much 5700 xts are selling for. That's what I did",
      "Considering it was twice as expensive as 480 and twice as fast, I wouldn't consider it a good card for the price, it only looked good compared to the equally overpriced Turing.",
      "What is the HDMI audio issue you are referring to?",
      "So true. The 6700XT is a \"mediocre\" card according to everyone, but I fucking love mine. It's a beast for 1080p 165hz and does everything I need it to.",
      "Upgrades for free are the best upgrades",
      "I think we live in a buy now think later market. Of course unless you’re buying something from zotac that is borderline scalper prices",
      "This is awesome.",
      "There was nothing to be impressed about when you had twice the performance for twice the money 3 years after 480.\n\nWhen I upgraded my 270X to 580, I got double the performance for almost the same money - but well, I guess those days are over, especially since people are pleased with anything right now.\n\nOh, and we're discussing about periods where GPUs **weren't** money printers, now it's a different story altogether + COVID, inflation and all that.",
      "since when a \"3070 with 12GB of memory\" is mediocre? these people",
      "In NZ they are just that much cheaper, and I'm also a long date AMD fan. I had heard that other 5000 series models (5500,5600,5700 nonXT) didn't have the issue so I was confident on the 6000 series.",
      "Yeah, I have a 5700 and haven't noticed any issues with HDMI audio on the rare occasions I use it.",
      "5700XT has some audio drops through HDMI, like a second long drop every few minutes. Not sure if it's only triggered with some specifics devices (Sony and Yamaha here), but if you research you'll see a lot of people talking about this particular issue. Fixed on 6000 gen (5700 non xt was ok I think)",
      "Really depends on what 5700XT you have tho, I own gigabyte 5700xt aorus and not only it is super quiet and with low temps, but it also basically run 2020MHz 24/7\n\nNot to say 6600xt is not great if you can swap for free (not possible where I live and most place's), but it’s not that simple conclusion and also depends on what exactly are the two cards in question. Mine is basically a lot faster vs reference that was a lot faster vs how you ran yours + no issues like hdmi audio and 4 years warranty - won’t swap it for just any 6600xt and ofc - I will not swap it for 6600xt at all as this will be not any upgrade performance wise (potentially it will be overall a downgrade). Would swap for 6800xt or up, but I am planning to wait for the next gen.",
      "May I ask why did you decide to stick with AMD GPU despite the issues you had with the 5700xt ?\n\nIn the end it paid off, but still out of curiosity.",
      "Do you have a link to these issues being actually acknowledged or documented?\n\n\nI had ZERO issues with my reference card while using HDMI audio to a Denon receiver also a Sharp TV."

What's that all about?",
      "Don't think people buying this kind of performance are often above 1080p, and the 1080 Ti is still quite powerful to his day (was a match for the 5700XT/RTX 2070, which aren't any slower than the 6600XT). It's probably losing steam in DX12 games but still, it's no slouch. ?ot sure why one would buy one at this price though",
      "Actually above 1080p is where the 1080ti claws back some ground. It's kinda hard to find good comparisons since the 1080ti is pretty old now, but Hardware Unboxed did a revisit a few months ago comparing it to a 3060 and 5700xt. \n\nWhen compared to the 3060 the 1080ti was 3% faster at 1080p but 5% faster at 1440p. When compared to the 5700xt the 1080ti was 3% slower at 1080p but equal at 1440p.\n\nI would imagine the same would hold true when compared to a 6600xt, probably due to the 6600xt's anemic memory setup.\n\nI think the 1080ti's memory config is really helping it's longevity. The 1080ti has 11GB GDDR5X on a 352bit bus which is good for 484.4 GB/s. Meanwhile the 6600xt is 8GB GDDR6 on a 128bit bus, good for only 256GB/s",
      "Agreed, my 1080ti is still going strong at 3440x1440 hoping to upgrade eventually with 7000 series assuming prices are reasonable, but not actually in any hurry to upgrade as I can still run most games on medium/high at 100+ fps (except bf2042 lol). On most older games (which is what I normally play, games like BFV, BF1, Destiny 2, Dayz) you can max out all settings and still easily hit 144+",
      "Which is bizarre because those cards are going to require some maintenance and are seriously showing their age at resolutions above 1080p",
      "Heh, even in games like Star Citizen, the 1080Ti is still a champ. The only exception being when you turn cloud settings to... Well, \"on\". \n\nOther than that, you only need a Schwarzenegger-CPU, then you're fine (I'm drooling over the 5800X3D, heh). \n\nWell, and preferably more than 16GB of RAM. \n\nWell, and you definitely need to have the game on an SSD. \n\nWell, and the page file of your OS on an SSD too. \n\nAnd THEN you're fine... Well, as fine as anyone can be.\n\nSo yeah, I'm glad plenty of games exist that are being continually optimized for older GPUs :) \n\n(In a sense, that's true for Star Citizen as well, as they basically based their performance target around the 1060 6GB card. Pre-cloud tech, anyway.)",
      "Not yet, but surely in my list, along with Pillar of Eternity and Trine series. Hopefully I can play these games at 144 fps with APU in the future."

Meanwhile, anything arbitrary we as consumers can say such as \"90C is safe\" or \"80C is too high\" (and I've heard both of those in the same thread before) come from nothing more scientific than our own personal *comfort levels* with various temps. Much of that is based on historical conventions that don't apply anymore (after all, at one point a 50C CPU was considered hot).\n\nIt's just like the old R9-290X debacle, where AMD officially stated they were designed to be run at 95C, and everyone freaked out because they were convinced that 95C would kill it in a matter of weeks. Lo and behold, I have an R9-290 that's been run on the stock cooler at 95C under full load still alive and kicking today, 8 years later.\n\nI won't say no to cooler temps when they're available.

At 31% higher price vs. 6700 XT STRIX, the MSI RX 6800 has 55% more silicon, 50% more VRAM, 33% more memory bandwidth, and 50% more CUs plus decent 4K gaming.\n\nThis whole situation looks like AMD wants people to buy RX 6900 XT. It's been rumored that AMD want to sell as much high-end stuff as possible and push aside the entry to mid-range market. AMD's first card to come back in stock were the RX 6900 XTs and followed by RX 6700 XTs (also $1700-$2000 price tag means low sustained demand). RX 6800/6800 XTs are coming back last because AMD's solid yields at TSMC mean that most Navi 21 dies can be 6900 XTs, so why disable CUs for lower margin RX 6800 series GPUs? At the end of the day, value and price-to-performance are no longer AMD's intention or goal. In contrast, NVIDIA's RTX 3060 and 3060Ti cards are this generation's price-to-performance leaders when in-stock.",
      "What a piece of crap, the 3060 have the same price/performance while having a lot of extra goodies like 4GB more vram, better rtx performance & support, DLSS, more memory bandwith to handle 1440p gaming without relying on cripplingly small cache.",
      "The biggest joke outside of the terrible \"MSRP\" is that it's AIBs only. So while before, a lucky few are able to get cards at MSRP from AMD's website, for this one... Not a chance. Least Nvidia still sells a 3060 Ti at MSRP on bestbuy when available which is a better buy even under normal circumstances.",
      "A worse 5700xt for more money, this is literal regression.",
      "Regardless of the current market prices, this MSRP is a joke."

I checked the airflow by dangling a piece of flimsy paper behind the exhaust fan to see it was blowing out the air instead, and it was blowing it out. \n\nOf course as the system fan came with the cabinet, it is not the best.

    "selftext": "Let me get this started by saying I dont like the MSRP either. You're basically getting a 5700 XT for 5700 XT prices. This is not generation to generation progress.\n\nBut... In the current market we're in, MSRP is almost meaningless. All the negative reviews and comments from everyone on launch for the 6600 XT seemed to have forgotten that the 3060 and 3060 Ti are virtually impossible to get for MSRP. The 3060 founders doesnt exist and I have yet to see **anyone** get one for its MSRP price. I have seen the occasional 3060 Ti for below 500, but they're extremely rare.\n\nAt the end of the day, it wouldnt have mattered if AMD set the MSRP at $379 or $250, the price is dictated by the supply and demand. What we have here is a realistic MSRP which matches the current market.\n\nBy the looks of it (at least here in the UK, the sapphire pulse has been sitting at £375 **in stock** all day at overclockers) the 6600 XT has immense supply. Many retailers have received more 6600 XT's than **all** Nvidia cards put together over the last week.\n\nEveryone was saying the 6600 XT is the end of the budget card. But I would argue otherwise. The 6600 XT has been by far the easiest card to buy at near its \"MSRP\". To the point where it will start pushing down RTX 3060 prices. Even if the 6600 XT only matched the 3060's performance, the fact that almost everywhere it can be found for $100-200 less is definitely taking away some of demand from the 3060.\n\nRight now, we simply need prices to drop. Not crazy low MSRP's that wont be achieved. And the 6600 XT is the card doing that.\n\nSure, lets say 6 months from now the 3060 and 3060 Ti can easily be had for MSRP, yes the 6600 XT is bad value. But who honestly thinks it wont drop in price? Remember what happened with Vega? A $400 Vega 56 and $500 Vega 64 were going for as low as $250 and $300 respectively, just over a year after release. I would not be surprised if we see this happen. Heck, I managed to pick up a Vega 64 Nitro+ brand new from scan for £250 in 2019.\n\nThe reason as to why the 5700 XT never dropped in price was because it was so competitive to start with. It punched in the same performance tier as the 2070 Super, a card which cost more than $100 more. The 5700 XT had no reason to be cheaper.\n\nTLDR: The 6600 XT is *currently* our saviour. Not the enemy.",

      "Thank you for the constructive take. Comparing by MSRP is simply missing the point, it's the actual prices that one is paying that matters.\n\nIt's a similar concept to buying a property, which has a government assessed value that is often different from the real market value. You won't see people basing their purchases on the government assessed value either, as that isn't the amount they will be paying.",

This card makes building a PC feasible now.",
      "I know it's hard to get into the minds of people who don't live in the world of trust funds and the bank of mummy and daddy, but some people don't build new systems every time they buy a new GPU. I'm just replacing an old, dead graphics card and looking to get something I'd want to use, and that won't fall badly behind because of a stupid limitation.\n\nAnd using that logic even high end GPUs are gimped because they could always carry more memory, have bigger dies ETC but that isn't the point here. I don't expect them to perform the same as top end cards but design decisions that reduce performance to save a couple of bucks on substrate to me are not a necessary compromise, that's just AMD being cheap.",
      ">By the looks of it (at least here in the UK, the sapphire pulse has been sitting at £375 in stock all day at overclockers) the 6600 XT has immense supply.\n\nAlternatively, they don't have immense supply and there isn't much demand. We have seen that people are more willing to pay up for green cards than red cards, and people are more willing to pay up for top end cards than low end cards.\n\n>Right now, we simply need prices to drop. Not crazy low MSRP's that wont be achieved. And the 6600 XT is the card doing that.\n\nYup. Any card AMD is willing to produce in volume is great news for the market.\n\n>Sure, lets say 6 months from now the 3060 and 3060 Ti can easily be had for MSRP, yes the 6600 XT is bad value.

I would not be surprised if we see this happen.\n\nIt strikes me that the 6600xt is bad value at MSRP. Of course, if its street price stays close to MSRP, it's far from the worst value on the market. It remains that very few gamers should be buying at market prices, particularly since this card is basically a half-gen card in terms of release cadence.",
      "If you want to argue that it's the least crappily priced card, maybe. But as someone who will be impacted by the decision to cheap out on PCI-E lanes I'll wait for a 3060 I can afford.",
      "Looking at the issue with Doom Eternal tells me the future. It loses 25% performance in 3.0 x8 mode which puts it behind a 3060. With the new consoles carrying 16GB of memory games are only going to get more memory intensive, so I don't expect this card to hold up well, as someone who doesn't upgrade regularly that would be a problem for me.",
      ">At the end of the day, it wouldnt have mattered if AMD set the MSRP at $379 or $250, the price is dictated by the supply and demand. What we have here is a realistic MSRP which matches the current market.\n\nTell me you know how capitalism works without telling me that you know how capitalism works. \n \nPricing is not mathematical, it's social, prices are determined by *perceived* value.

Is it a good value *in the current GPU market?*  Unfortunately, yeah, it is. \n \n>\"You should buy a 3060 or a 3060Ti instead.\" \n \nThat just *isn't* a viable option right now, it probably won't be a viable option for months to come.",

I haven't had a chance to test many of them, but I'd generally expect x670/B650 boards to be faster than something like A620 just because the latter would likely have less PCB levels, and is less likely to use low/med-loss PCB material, among other design choices.\n\nAll of the x670e boards that I have personally tested are DDR7200 stable (mostly 2DPC boards).

Were I buying a 1080p constrained budget card today, RT would be the least of my worries. Looking at the 100 most played games on Steam, it appears it's the least of everyone's worries. Nevertheless, DF continue to choose to use 6 NVIDIA sponsored games, give too much emphasis to RT, ignore that upscaling/reconstruction below 4K is REALLY sub par and more egregious of all, being called EUROgamer, ignore that the 6600XT is the only fucking card you can buy since launch throughout Europe without selling a kidney. Would I advise anyone buying it? Fuck yes, if you need a card and have the money and don't want to pay 150% MSRP, otherwise sit this, the 3060 and 3060ti out, they are absolutely garbage tier value historically, a fact which apparently does not merge well with the very NVIDIA friendly (heavily sponsored) DF editorial direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: this should be, at best, a 200€ card.

If you stick it in a 3.0 slot it’s slower than a 5700XT, so it’s actually less-desirable for the crowd that it should be aimed at (people holding on to their older cards and hardware as long as possible). \n\nPlus you’re paying the same price or more than a 5700XT cost right before the launch of RDNA2. I got my XFX THICC II 5700XT for $336 a couple months before RDNA2 launched for example. I reckon if the market weren’t compromised by crypto and the pandemic that the 6600XT would have been a sub-$300 card, and for under $300 it would have been a great buy. $380 for essentially a more flawed version of a 5700xt though? Years later? Yeah not so sure about that.",

I could have sold it for more because it went in like 2 hours. Probably Could have gotten $860+\n\n$379 is too much for a midrange card, yes, in theory. In practice, these cards will be sold out at $500 as an incredible deal -- because that's almost what a used RX580 costs these days -- and you'll actually be seeing them sold closer to $600+, still being sold out.  I'm 100% going to buy one if I see a $500 price, because I'll get more performance than my 5700 and a few hundred in spending cash as the net result, even if the card isn't worth half of that $500 under normal circumstances. \n\nBoth Nvidia and AMD are selling every single card they make, and they're selling them way cheaper than their actual market value. \n\nBecause, again, $379 is way, way below market value for an 6600XT right now. \n\nHow are AMD or Nvidia greedy fucks for selling below market value? And why would it matter in the first place if the MSRP price is fake bullshit in the first place? \n\nI understand the people who are worried that this is the new normal, but those people are complete idiots. In a competitive market, prices aren't dictated by tradition or expectations. They are dictated by how much it costs to bring something to market (i.e. the margin) and the supply and demand for the thing being made.

Hot spot had nearly 110 Celsius degrees and the card fan noise was similar to the starting airplane. It was working with max RPM all the time (3400) in any games that would make the card warmer than 73 degrees (I read that the issue is related to a faulty temp controller because I was not able to change the fan curve in the MSI Afterburner). So I was told that I will get my money back and now I am looking for a new GPU. My budget is limited and RX 6600 seems to be the best option. My CPU is 12400f, I have a 550W PSU and 16GB of RAM. My MOBO has a PCI 4.0 slot.\n\nAs I mentioned in the title, the last time I used the AMD card was 14 years ago and it was the Radeon HD 4850. I had so many driver issues with it that I just didn't want to have an AMD card in the next years. \n\nNow we have 2022 and I know 2 things:\n1. I don't want another 2060 (I read too many things about how bad the 20xx series is)\n2. I also read many things about how good performance/price you get with the RX 6600.\n\nThe problem is no matter where I go I find lots of people complaining about the AMD drivers. There are users who had no issues at all, there are users who experience some issues for a week or two after releasing new drivers and then they are fine for a month and also there are users who had so many driver issues that they gave up and rebought NVIDIA card.\n\nI mean it happens both ways. All I want is peace. I play a lot. Would you give a shot to RX 6600? I can get the XFX SWFT 210 Speedster with Dead Island code 2 for the price of returned RTX 2060. I saw that it will give me around 10% performance boost on average but all I care about is not looking for another card in the next months after buying this one due to some issues.",

      "Honestly, with how much they've improved, it gives me hope for Intel's graphics drivers too.",
      "I highly recommend using the AMD Driver Cleanup over DDU if you ever do have troubles. DDU still sounds the best to clean your Nvidia drivers out before the AMD driver is installed. Optional driver updates are really optional, but I still pick them up right away if they targeted a new game I'm going to play.",
      "It's funny because I just picked up a second hand rx 580 for my second machine (1060 in my main machine) and I am really impressed by amd's software so far. It tells you the actual gpu power draw! I had to change the default fan curve, put a cap on power draw to limit it to the same 120w max as my 1060, used radeon chill to lock fps to 60 with supposedly reduced latency compared to vsync, got some really good looking sharpening going on too and it's super responsive. \n\nThere's so many features in adrenalin and so much real-time data that you don't get with nvidia\n\nEdit: the power limiter lead to a bluescreen during darktide, and my fan curve adjustment caused an overheat in darktide after 4-5 hours. My own fault for slapping those values in without stress testing it. Default seems to be OK and power draw was near enough 120 under load anyway",
      "Yup, the entire problem with Arc is 100% drivers - and intel knew it would be, i'm pretty sure that is why they only tried to compete midrange on silicon.\n\nthe reason the amd and nvidia driver packages weight half a gig is because there is an entire library of game specific fixes and optimizations (rewritten shaders, etc) in them.\n\nthe arc is also not even running D3D11 or D3D9. They're doing JIT translation of all non-D3D APIS to D3D12.  That is going to take some time for them to mature that code and get it up and good.\n\ni expect by the end of the decade intel gpus might be competing at the top end",
      "The only time you can probably get some errors is when pushing oc too much, Nvidia doesn't even have a built-in feature like in order to play safe, then people tend to blame AMD for \"bad\" drivers for their own mistakes when in reality AMD is giving you a little bit more freedom to play with graphics card settings, oc'ing, fans speed, etc\n\nAdrenalin is a full feature software, easy to use once you understand how to use it.\n\nI've been using Radeon graphics since the R9270X era exclusively, it's been a great journey for me so far, so much that I have never considered buying into Nvidia at this point.",

      "I've still never had a driver issue in 7 years of using Radeon GPUs. \n\nThere were a couple releases where radeon settings was a bit buggy, mainly UI stuff. But always solid performance. \n\nJust stick to the most recent recommended driver and you'll be good.",

      "That works too because of very large chunk of people that have AMD driver issues are people that have switched over from Nvidia and haven't done a clean install or they haven't used ddu",
      "I had a 5700XT before the current 3080FE and never had any issues even during the peak of the black screen driver complaints. It was a Sapphire Nitro+ which was one of the top of the line models which maybe why it was faultless. Also had good quality HDMI cable and EVGA power supply.",
      "And has no warranty. Used cards without warranty are like lottery tickets. There is no point in buying them unless you have 200+ USD to take a risk.",
      "I will just go with a clean installation.",
      "Run the stable driver (not the optional driver) and I doubt you'll find a single instability. Been rock solid",
      "If you are just a gamer, and dont do heavy streaming and content creation, imo AMD has the better drivers by now (simply because of modern looking UI that gives you ton of options you dont have with stoneage nv ui). I joined AMD 1,5 years ago (6800XT) after 17 years NV only and didnt regret it once. More the contrary, i wonder how NV still has this ugly ui and so much less utility in their drivers. The last issue AMD drivers had were their huge DX9/11 overhead. But the pretty much fixed it a couple of months ago.",
      "I don't know who needs to hear this but I was getting pretty regular timeout errors in almost every game I played with my 6900xt.  I tried underclocking it maxing the fans running older driver versions etc.  Turns out it was my RAM the entire time, even though it was on XMP it wanted more voltage.  Every crash seemed like a GPU related crash (adrenaline error or GoW was saying GPU temp errors) but it was RAM in the end.",
      ">Yup, the entire problem with Arc is 100% drivers \n\nOh, the hardware has big issues too.   Awful idle power usage, even in the best case scenario (DX 12 game, higher res) the performance isn't very good for something with that much die are and power usage.\n\nIntel has a long way to go hardware wise as well.",
      "My 6900xt is the first AMD card I've owned since the 290x in 2014. Got it a few months ago.\n\nIn the 4 months I've had it I haven't had any issues. It replaced a 3080."

I don't think I've heard from anyone at GSKILL in like \\~15+ years, so rather doubtful; IIRC their response way back then was not offering review samples due to few kits performing so exceptionally well while granted these days they seem to be much more robust. The other GSKILL units I have were received from AMD in prior review kit bundles.",

Zen 5 might be a little better, but there aren't enough sample to be sure yet. \n\nWith Zen 4, above 6000 MT/s fCLK is more important for real-world performance than the memory frequency - assuming timings are already tuned. \n\nFrom my experience, unless specified otherwise, motherboards will usually drop the uCLK to 2:1 above 6000 MT/s. In most cases, 1:1 should work up to 6600 MT/s, again, if the CPU can handle it. \n\nSo the absolute highest you can go on Zen 4 would 2x32GB 6600 MT/s (\\~CL28, \\~120ns tRFC) 2200 MHz fCLK, 3300 MHz mCLK and uCLK. This configuration should outperform a 8000 MT/s tuned configuration that is running at 2000 MHz uCLK and 4000 MHz mCLK and 2200 fCLK, since the IMC is running slower and also since tREFI cannot be raised above 65635, meaning that higher mCLK values reduce memory performance due to the memory doing refresh cycles more frequently. This is an artificial limitation on the Zen 4 memory controller / UEFI.",

Dunno what the board will output but AIDA64 has that info\n\nand 8000MHz is 2000Fclk (1:4) + 2000UCLK + 4000MCLK",

      "tRFC and tREFI are the most important, IMO. You can have a kit that is stable at 8000 MT/s with CL10, but if set tRFC close to tREFI, the RAM is unusable. More realistically, good kits can push tRFC really low (Hynix A-die is around 120ns, or ~360 cycles at 6000 MT/s, M-die is around 160ns, or ~480 cycles at 6000 MT/s, while most Samsung kits are around 800 cycles at 6000 MT/s. Obviously, cutting the refresh cycle by half is going to improve performance noticably. The rest of the secondary timings are also quite important, you can get some nice performance with them. Tertiary timings are interesting when you have dual rank memory, otherwise most of the timings are not really used. Primary timings are the least impactful, apart from scoring well on memory benchmarks that are doing artifacial, burst-y memory operations. Just imagine how often a real game or app, using 8-20 GBs of memory at a time, will access 8 bytes of memory. As in only 8 bytes. No more. In that case, primary timings are super important, but if you need more memory than 4 Unicode characters, secondary timings are in play already, and there you have tFAW and tRRD (S and L) and tWTR (S and L) timings in play, governing the vast majority of memory operations.",

However more competitive games like CS and such then x3d CPUS  are gonna be a fantastic upgrade.\n\nSo in general gaming 5600x with a 6750xt is a fantastic pairing. I had 5600 with 6750xt and upgraded to 5800x3d. Thats because i wanted more fps in games like CS but also a more future proof CPU. The 5800x3d is really good in gaming that it will last for a while and you can just upgrade the GPU and it will still hang with that. In gaming at least. Other things it might hang back but it is very future proof for gaming. If it wasnt for something like CS2 and me wanting future proofing then a 5600 would still have been good and i would have upgraded GPU instead.\n\nHowever i decided to get CPU and upgrade GPU later as 6750xt is pretty good for now.\n\nAs AMD has extended their AM4 support, I would even suggest that you get a better future proof GPU right now. It will do fine paired with the 5600x, unless you want higher performance in competitive games then obviously go with 6750xt and x3d CPU, in that case 5700x3d is gonna be a great choice as well.\n\nHowever if you play more graphics heavy games and such. Then i would even suggest not upgrading CPU just yet(wait to upgrade CPU). Instead put money to get 7800xt or better as GPU. Save up a bit again and buy a x3d CPU later on. That way you will be even more future proof set.\n\nYou could get a 5700x3d as well save that money and put it into GPU. But 5600x or 57/8x3d both will do great paired with a 6750xt.",

      "Don't worry so much about the memory voltages - just use the rated value, which is probably 1.35v for that kit. DDR6000 will run with SOC @ 1.2V or lower.  You want to run the lowest stable SOC voltage to reduce waste heat and shift more of the socket power budget to the CPU cores.  1.15V is stable on many/most CPU samples with DDR6000. The reason DDR6000 is the \"sweet spot\" is because it is about the fastest speed you can run while keeping UCLK at 1:1 ratio (3000MHz instead of 1500MHz in this case).  Good luck, take care!",

SOC drawing 7 watts at idle and 13 watts under heavy load...\n\nVDDG (both) - 0.85\nVDDSOC -1.07\nVDDIO - 1.35\nVDDMEM/VDDQMEM - 1.43\nVDDP - 0.95\n\nAIDA MEM results - 67500/94000/67500/59.6\n\nZen4 does not require high voltage for 6000C30. The gains from 6000C30 to 6400C30 are almost nil, is less than 1% in synthetics and a 0% gain in almost every game. \n\n6400 is not the way.\n\nYou gain zero on read/copy and about 4000mb/s in write speeds as well as -1ns first word access time going from 6000 to 6400.\n\nThe gains for 7800X3D should target IF instead. Each step of stable IF over 2000 is about 1000mb/s read/copy and -0.5ns first word, up to 2133. Above 2133 you will have latency performance regression whilst still gaining bandwidth, so it's still a gain, but the gain is so small it's not worth pumping any voltage to get.\n\n7800X3D is not limited by IO at 6000C30, it's limited by AMD SMU programing to target 1.08 VDDCPU and 80 watts before pulling core speed back instead of letting the CPU actually boost to 1.15 like it should be. \n\nYou can confirm this yourself, go run OCCT CPU benchmarks or look at the database of results and look at sustained VDDCPU/PPT during high load.

Llano blew that out of the water easily.\n\nProgress! But old systems will usually need something cheap to replace dead cards, or newish ones to reuse existing.",
      "Except for that the 6980HX and its Radeon 680M GPU is a 12 CU APU Product, whereas \"Raphael\" seems to shape up to have a 4 CU Design, that in anything but the top end SKUs seems to be binned to 3 CUs for the vast majority of first wave Desktop APUs for AM5.  \n\nYes we heard rumors about \"Phoenix APUs\" being potentially 24 CU Parts, but nobody yet knows if those are meant for Desktop Sockets, when they will come, or what kind of Tradeoff will be made on their CPU side to make enough spacial and thermal \"room\" to fit them there.",
      "Yep, gonna be interesting in three years.",
      "It's worth pointing out that the RX 6400 is out now while the AM5 APUs are still at least half a year or longer away.\n\nI don't see what's so mind blowing about a future APU outperforming an existing low end card.",
      "There are both Raphael and Phoenix. Raphael is the Zen 4 with just some not-too-fast iGPU, kinda Intel UHD.",
      "All APUs we got on AM4 were repurposed Laptop Chips, in which offering \"powerful graphics\" makes sense for single chip thin & light / cheap designs that are space and power constrained, that were put in Packages that allowed them to run on Desktop Boards, but they all were monolithic designs that sacrificed CPU Performance by taking some space from the CPU portion to fit the GPU parts in.  \n\nFrom what we know so far, the reason \"all AM5 CPUs will be APUs\" is because AMD tries to streamline their lineup, by getting rid of monolithic designs, and making the iGPU part of the IO Die, to still be able to offer multi chiplet chips without wasted duplicated resources.  \n\nthose IO Die iGPUs will not necessarily always be on the same process as the CPU chiplets. AMD is trying to get to the \"good enough for basic tasks\" APUs intel has basically had since 2nd Gen Core.  \n\nYes, they might still do \"more powerful\" APUs, but you can only make integrated graphics so good until you run into space, power and cooling issues, because whatever iGPU you decide on still shares the same contact surface and cooler on top other stuff that fits into the socket does.",
      "The rumours out there, for example this one from a leaker that has atleast in the past been reasonably accurate (Komachi) points to a 4CU 0.5Tflop iGPU for Raphael (Zen 4). https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-7000-raphael-rdna2-igpu-could-offer-a-third-of-steam-decks-graphics-performance\n\nSome APU's probably will have more CU's, if we get designed for mobile APU's to desktop again (like the Cezanne based 5x00G we have now) as we  but at least, but i wouldn't expect the full AM5 lineup to have powerful gpu's for now. There seems to be a good chance that the desktop parts get a Intel like iGPU, and not something more powerful as for example Rembrandt has in mobile (Ryzen 6000).",
      "Even if that rumour will end up being true IIRC those iGPUs are supposed to be very weak and even then that won't suddenly add iGPUs to all of the AM4 CPUs and other CPUs lacking iGPUs.",
      "Construction Wise, with how Chip and Memory are layed out on the PCB, and how much space and attachment points they have for putting a cooling solution onto it, it much more resembles a GPU that happens to contain CPU cores too than the other way round.  \n\nThe size you have to work with to fit everything is the CPU socket, the heat transfer is not direct Die cooling but is an IHS, and the amount of power you can push through it is determined by how the motherboard VRM is layed out, all this restricts an APU on a PC motherboard far more than the chip of a console.",

People will tell you that the 6600 XT is mediocre at QWHD, they never\n\nI'm gonna go out and say that i'm satisfied with my 6600XT and I play at 1440p. It's run every thing i've thrown at it well at high settings, Insurgency Sandstorm, Battlefield 2042 (I only played it just so I could benchmark it at 1440p, that game sucks), Forza Horizon 5, CoD, etc. I've seen benchmarks of it at 1440p from other people and it did fine. Now the obvious exception is Cyberpunk but that game doesn't run very good on anything, and i'm fine with lowering to medium (which I think gives the 6600XT around 65FPS from what I saw from RandomGamingInHD's video on the card) and I don't really understand how it's lackluster for 1440p when it can run most stuff just fine even at high.\n\nSome people argue that the 3060 TI is superior in every single way and I do agree. The problem is, that it's just much harder to find one. Didn't find no 3060 TIs at my Microcenter but I found two 6600 XTs for just $540. Looking at eBay I find 3060 TIs at like 850 but i've regularly seen 6600 XT deals on r/buildapcsales.\n\nAlso the 6800 (non-XT) is marketed as a 4K card but it performs about the same at 4K as a 6600 XT would at 1440p which is really confusing as to why AMD says you should just stick to 1080p. If the 6800 is a 4K card then the 6600 XT is a 1440p card IMO.\n\nTLDR: I have a 1440p monitor, and i'm satisfied with my 6600 XT, and I think it gets too much hate.\n\nEdit: Lot of people tell me \"the 6700 XT is the 1440p card. Not 6600 XT\" the problem is, that NVIDIA has not one but two 1440p cards: 3060 TI and 3070 were both marketed for 1440p.\n\nHere's how I would've marketed:\n\n6500 XT: 1080p60 medium\n\n6600: 1080p144\n\n6600 XT: 1080p144/1440p60\n\n6700 XT: 1440p144\n\n6800: 1440p144/4k60\n\n6800 XT+: 4k60",
    "comments": [
      "Just my 2 cents here...\n\nFirst appreciate the feedback. It's interesting to market to gamers especially as it grows more popular. I always felt like \"1440p\" was this grey area where your average gamer might not know what it is and an informed gamer might do their own research beyond the marketing. What really matters to me is connecting to people with their use case. \n\nDo you feel like more people are aware of resolutions outside 1080/HD and 4k?",
      "But isn't the 6700xt marketed for 1440p?  I mean, it says right there on the boxes. https://images.offerup.com/y3PtGNMpbiTrdUH4FC5xmRyMKS0=/888x1920/38d6/38d6140b46994885b969b5f7cf6cc071.jpg",
      "Sure does. There is no silver bullet for marketing and there can be reasons to do or not do something without ruling it out. For instance on a shelf I think it can help quickly demonstrate what product class something is in, so putting it on the box seems pretty useful here! On the internet I think research is a quick search away, so on-the-box features seem less important to me personally.",
      "I just find it dubious how the 5700 XT was marketed as a 1440p card, and the 6600 XT, which performs like a 5700 XT, was marketed as a 1080p card.",
      "On some level I can understand the reason for it being marketed as a 1080p 144hz card, and I also doubt that the average PC gamer will go for 1440p by comparison.\n\nThe thing is that there definitely IS an audience for 1440p and i'm a part of it. The problem I have is how AMD priced this card only 20 dollars lower than the 3060 TI, which is a true 1440p performer and as a result this turned many people off from it. Paying close to 400 dollars for something advertised as a 1080p class card is really not the best look for your it, but once I look past that I could understand why one would want this card for 1440p. It's a big leap from 1080p in quality and many enthusiasts say it's the real sweet spot for gaming, not too taxing like UHD and better quality than FHD. In 5 years time I can see 1080p going the way of 720p today.\n\nHonestly I look at the 6600 XT as the ultimate 1080p card with an asterisk for 1440p next to it.",
      "I think the reason is product segmentation. 6700XT -> 1440p, 6800XT -> 4k, so to not mix up with 6700XT, it seems reasonable to put 6600XT in \"Premium\" 1080p, with 6600 non-XT being \"standard\" 1080p and 6500 series as \"entry\" 1080p. FullHD get bit crowded, but realistically no one uses lower resolution anymore.\n\n6800 non-XT is in similar spot, its neither fully 1440p, nor fully 4K.",
      "It mainly boils down to the memory subsystem of the card.  In order for GPU's to churn out rendered frames, they need to keep the shader registers fed with data to calculate from.  That data comes from the graphics memory on the card.\n\nUntil RDNA2, over the past 6 years or so, there have basically been two choices to keep those shaders fed with data.  \n\nOne is to still use GDDR memory but increase the number of memory channels.  This increases throughput, at the expense of die real estate and power consumption, because you need more memory controllers on the GPU, and more memory chips on the board.  It's actually a compounded problem.  Not only do more memory controllers on the chip take up space that might otherwise be used for more shaders, the extra power consumption of those controllers, as well as the chips on the board, might prevent the GPU from running as fast as it could due to power budget limitations.\n\nThe second is to skip GDDR and use HBM instead.  It uses a lot less power, and is a lot faster, because it has a much wider bus and a much shorter distance between the memory and GPU.  It's also a lot more expensive.\n\nAMD did something pretty innovative with RDNA2, however.  They added a whole lot of cache instead of extra memory controllers.  This greatly increases the effective throughput of the memory, while using less power.  It's not saving any die space (might be losing a bit), because the L3 cache takes up room by itself, but you're getting more performance from using that die area for L3 than more memory controllers.\n\nBut it's not a silver bullet.  How effective cache is depends on how big it is and how much distinct data passes through it.  The amount of data goes up with resolution (more pixels to render, with all the associated memory costs of that).  So as resolution goes up, the cache hit rate for a given amount goes down.  \n\nThe 6800, 6800 XT, and 6900 XT have 128MB of L3 cache, which gives those cards a good hit rate at 3840x2160, and an excellent hit rate at 2560x1440.  Combine that with a 256-bit bus, and the effective memory speed is in HBM territory.  The 6700 XT has 96MB of L3 and a 192-bit bus, which basically shifts the performance adjectives down a resolution tier.\n\nThe 6600 XT drops all the way down to 32MB of L3 with a 128-bit bus.  That means its memory performance is merely good for 1920x1080, and not quite adequate above that.\n\nSo while the card, computationally, is easily capable of handling 2560x1440 most of the time, it's going to spend more time than it should *not* computing anything while waiting on data from memory.\n\nYou can also run games at 3840x2160 with that card, and if they're old enough or graphically light enough, they'll work fine.  Just not as well as they would with a better memory subsystem.\n\nSo AMD was correct to market the card to the resolution it provides the best results in.",

And ultimately a GPU being a luxury product anyways makes the entire purchasing decision a product of \"wants\" rather than \"needs\". \n\n6600XT is only \"bad at 1440p\" if your definition of bad is below 120FPS. \n\nFor reference, this card can be around twice as fast as an RX580.",

So obviously, is not like you put 1440p and then is shit.\n\n>i'm satisfied with my 6600XT and I play at 1440p\n\nNobody say you wouldn't, just that the card is not so strong at 1440p and AMD is putting all their bets on it being capable to do max settings at 1080p, and this is what they want to sell. Perhaps to don't compete against themselves in the \"1440p market\", who knows, you could argue that it is or it isn't a good marketing strategy, just that they never said is 1080p only.",
      "💯\nHere is the thing : it is 1000% a 1440p card. The last year getting back into the PC hobby has shown me how aggressively branded and upsold the PC community is. It's insane what happens in PC communities with people buying these absurdly overspec'd GPU and CPU. A totally killer 1080p card that can easily play modern titles at totally reasonable frame rates in the 2019 GTX 1650 - these days PC marketing treats this like a extinct dinosaur.

      "Mickey I think one of the biggest misses in the PC gaming community as a whole is the value of 1440p/60hz. \n\n1440p60 should be talked about more when demonstrating rich single player story driven games like the Assassins Creed, God of War,  and Horizon Zero Dawn. \n\nThe conversation around these game is almost always driven by 4k because of the television market, but PC users have much more flexibility than the console user. \n\n1440p marketing in general needs an overhaul. It's the best price to performance resolution and AMD could help change some of the mindset around frames per second. Not every game needs to run at 120+ FPS for wonderful experience.",
      "I think they decided to market it rather as 1080p cause you can see clearly scaling issues compared to the nvidia cards 3060/3060ti when u go up in resolution in higher demanding games. But like you for me its perfectly fine at 1440p cause it handles the games i play.\nedit: and that probably was the right move as you can see in the rewiews for this card when it came out. This was its main critic point.",

      "It’s definitely playable on 1440p, but it’s 1440p results aren’t that impressive compared to its Nvidia counterparts. \n\nThe 3060 is very close behind (5%) in 1440p and if on PCIE 3.0, it might end up being slower than the 3060. I know MSRP doesn’t matter much these days but people still do comparison based on MSRP and that wouldn’t seem nice to market as. \n\nNot to mention at 1080p, it’s right in the middle between a 3060 and 3060 ti, which makes it super attractive for 1080p gaming as it can run high refresh rate monitors."

If you have a PCIe 4.0 platform there's no reason to consider a card like the RX 580 4GB unless it's significantly cheaper.",

It will also likely not last as long as a card in a factory new condition.\n\n2. The RX 6500 XT will likely perform better than the RX 580 if only because the RX 5500 XT was already at the performance level of the RX 580. \n\n3. The RX 6500 XT will receive better driver support and it will receive driver support for a lot longer than Polaris cards. AMD dropped support for GCN 1.3 half a year ago and Polaris is next on the chopping block.",
      "I mean... even at $150 or so, it's not the worst option in the world.\n\nThese days you can get a decent enough CPU for around $150. But getting anything that actually plays games reasonably well at that price range is a complete fantasy. The GT 1030 is a fucking *terrible* GPU.\n\nThis thing's not very good, but at least you could get some decent medium/low 1080p gaming out of it for 3 years or so.",
      "not much sense talking MSRP when retails is 2x that on average, even more with some nvidia cards. Also my bet MSRP will be $249 on this one, so expect retail at over $400 if availability is similar to other cards.. And shit won't get any better in 2022, maybe in 2023 if lucky. It's just mining and silicon crisis combined makes GPU market especially totally absurd these days. So you either sit with your Polaris for till 2023 or pay premium scalp and grab the upgrade - that's simple reality we're living in right now. But good luck playing most AAA games with Polaris - Halo Infinite is basically unplayable even at low. Dying Light - don't think 60fps will be achievable. Elden Ring - maybe as game isn't much more visually impressive than Dark Souls 3, tho it's open world so who knows and optimization is always a question mark with Japanese games. So basically Forget AAA 60fps with polaris.\n\nAlso, at least here RX 6600 XT is around 200€ cheaper than base RTX 3060, lol. So it's good card in that sense, actually RX 6600-series is the only \"budget\" option right now at least in most countries at at least can play any AAA game in 1080p.",

There is nothing budget here and it makes perfect sense to include atleast some RTX performance metrics.\n\nEven without DLSS and FSR both can do RTX although Nvidia is obv superior. With FSR and DLSS both are very capable of decent to good RTX performance.",
      "funny thing to say when you have AMD sponsored games like ac:valhalla and far cry 6 on the other side\n\nand since when is RE:Village Nvidia sponsored? That’s an AMD title as well",
      "Considering 3060 and 6600XT is pretty much at price parity in many market, 3060 is probably a safer bet for a GPU that stays relevant somewhat longer.\n\nI wonder when will 12GB VRAM actually start to net some benefit? Or maybe higher bandwidth will become useful first?\n\nBTW am I remembering it wrong...? I swear when 6600XT and 3060 launch my impression is 6600XT is significantly faster in raster only title, and somehow a few months after launch it no longer is the case?",
      "Basically, the regular AMD \"fan\" functions like this:\n\nPlease do not test any game that doesnt run well on amd. Pease remove all of them. Then cherry pick all the titles that are broken on nvidia and run disproportionately fast on amd. \n\nIm an amd fan damn it, don't give me real results, give me the ones that show amd winning",
      "I just checked and the cheapest 3060 here in Germany is 449€, cheapest rx6600xt is 430€, so yeah they are priced about the same.\n\nEdit: cheapest rx 6600xt is 420€",
      "That is not how you calculate the average, there are at least 3 better ways of going about it. As clearly stated in the video, we leave RT enabled when enabled by default which it is in F1 2021 (2022 isn't out yet), Resident Evil Village and Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition.",
      "Completely unbiased person right here lol. \n\nThe thing about RSR and NIS is a lie, both work the same but AMD has a better GUI switch for it. Quality the same as well.\n\nNow tell us how raytracing is useless and dlss is stupid.",
      "8-10%? Did you do the math ? Removing all 3 RT titles (and keeping all amd sponsord titles as well), only amounted for 1.4% \n\nRemoving all 3 RT titles, the 6600xt is 4.4% faster at FHD, 0.6% slower at 1440p.",
      "> Because ofc people buying this tier of GPUs are all about ray tracing.\n\nThe 3060 runs all those games fine with RT enabled. What's the problem? Wait, you are upset because the 6600xt has terrible RT performance so the 3060 shouldn't do it either? lol.",
      "Don't discuss with this guy, no point. \nHe's just upset that his GPU with about the same price isn't able to do the same in raytracing and has less features so he's mentally justyfing his purchase by telling himself that rt performance doesn't matter for this GPU tier and that those features aren't usable.",

I swear when 6600XT and 3060 launch my impression is 6600XT is significantly faster in raster only title, and somehow a few months after launch it no longer is the case?\n\nThese tests have been done with updated drivers. That can change the result quite significantly especially when comparing GPUs that were close in performance to begin with. This is where the \"FineWine\" meme came from as GCN GPUs have gained a lot of performance over time due to improvements on the driver level.",
      "If they are enabled by default then i see no problem, Ray Tracing is the future of graphics and it will only get implemented in future games more often than ever before.",

And the dollar worth the same as 6 years ago, too.\n\nUnless 7nm costs halved since 2019 then Navi23 is about $40 die, and G6 spot price is $10, so a 6600 costs like $100 just for the gpu+mem, so $200 is not a possible \"should\"",
      "We're not including older GPUs in these head to heads but if we did we'd probably show both results. FYI the second highest quality preset in F1 2021 also enables the same level of RT effects by default.",
      "I literally tried WD legion yesterday on my 3060 and on high settings and mid RT it almost never dropped below 60. No DLSS involved.\n\nYou can see in the video the 3060 does 90 fps on Metro Exodus with mid RT. No DLSS involved.\n\nF1 2020 ultra high q with rt also 90 fps, no DLSS.\n\nDLSS at 1080p depends heavily on the title, on some games is completely unusable, like in Warzone or God of War, in others like Cyberpunk or Watch dogs it is unnoticeable."

In shortage conditions, retail eats last.\n\nThat being said, XSX is the best Xbox ever. They are finally building systems that offer a gaming experience I'd actually want.

Of course this is a cut down version, so it wouldn't be the full cost difference, but probably still a good chunk more.  And then it has GDDR6 over GDDR5.  Perhaps if memory prices had actually come down a lot since 2016, it wouldn't be such a big deal, but they sadly haven't.  \n\nI'd be very surprised if this was actually cheaper to make than a 580.",

After the initial batch is sold out (the batch is very small), the prices will go up significantly. For example the 6600XT launched very close to MSRP in Western Europe with seemingly decent stock, but less than a week later all of those subsidized cards were gone and the only ones in stock now are well above MSRP (the 6600XT is over 750 USD in the Benelux and Germany right now). NVIDIA isn't doing any better, the 3060 is around that price as well.",

It is worth remembering that HUB doesn't use SAM, so results with SAM might be more favorable.\n\n330 USD *\"MSR-LOL-P\"*\n\nThis card, its performance and its price, surely is not for everyone, but for RX 580 and 1060 owners, this represents a massive upgrade, about 2X raw performance and DirectX12 Ultimate support.\n\nNow I know the argument: *\"I paid $230 for my 580 4 years ago, I am not paying 400+ bucks for an upgrade for 1080p gaming!\"*. The solution to that is: *\"why not sell your 580 for 400+ bucks, in the second hand market?\"* At least back in August, you would find a buyer in a heartbeat. Not sure how the second hand market is now, but I assume it hasn't changed much. As bad as new GPU prices are nowadays, so are the prices of used GPUs, and anyone looking for an upgrade should use that to their advantage. If done timely, an upgrade like this could cost very little, if anything.\n\nAh, and for the \"no chance in hell the 6600 will land in the stores for less than 2X MSRP\", it actually did. 349 euros in a local store, in stock. I checked again 15 minutes later, it was still there, 20 minutes later, gone. Still, I took a [screenshot as proof](https://ibb.co/1bxTb4q). If you are actually dead interested in buying a GPU, you can't wait a month, you have to pull the trigger the moment it drops.

    "selftext": "I keep seeing people say that the RX 6700XT is just a cheaper RTX 3070, but it's not as simple as that.\n\n1. The RX 6700XT does not have a viable DLSS 2.0 alternative. Some people may argue that DLSS is irrelevant, but I think not. DLSS has come to a point where it is a viable feature to use in order to achieve smoother frames and higher resolutions when your hardware can't do so. For example, I have a 3060 Ti and I use it in Cyberpunk. Without DLSS, I am unable to reach a steady 1080p 60FPS with everything (including RT) on Ultra/Psycho settings. With Fidelity FX still being quite lackluster, AMD needs to launch a DLSS alternative soon.\n2. The RX 6700XT also has a lower memory bandwidth. The RTX 3070 has a 256-bit BUS and the RX 6700XT has a 192-bit BUS. I know this is not important to most people, but it still can be useful to have a higher bandwidth. (Edit: I forgot about the 96MB of Infinity Cache, so don't take this point as seriously.)\n3. The RX 6700XT is expected to have noticeably lower Ray Tracing performance than the RTX 3070. Of course, this is due to AMD being on its first generation of RT cores, while Nvidia is on their second. While not everyone uses RT, it has become more and more popular in games.\n4. The RX 6700XT has an extra 4GB of memory. This will make the 6700XT better in some tasks that require more VRAM, such as higher resolution gaming and workstation tasks.\n\nAm I saying that the RX 6700XT sucks? No. I actually plan on switching back to AMD Radeon and buying a 6700XT or 6800 for SAM and Radeon Software (note: Radeon Software ≠ Drivers), but I will say that the 6700XT is slightly overpriced. With that said, if you manage to find a 6700XT for a reasonable price, you should definitely buy it. I don’t need to explain why.\n\nEdit: As u/Excsekutioner and u/HaloLegend98 said, the absence of a good video encoder like Nvidia's NVEnc is also a point.\n\nEdit 2: I’m not trying to start a war between Nvidia and AMD users or start an argument about whether DLSS, NVEnc, and/or RT is important. Some people use and like DLSS and RT, and some people don’t like DLSS and RT. Some people like AMD cards and some people like Nvidia cards. We should respect each-other’s opinion and not force or criticize people into changing their opinions. I’m just laying out the facts on the 6700XT compared to the 3070 and why’s the 6700XT is not just a $20 cheaper 3070. And again, I’m not an AMD hater, I use or have used both Radeon and Ryzen and had decent experiences. I’m also not a Nvidia or Intel hater, and I have used Intel and Nvidia products before as well and had decent experiences.",

      "You don't really need the \"tensor cores\" or \"ai hardware\" to do DLSS, the inferencing work doesn't need to be matrix based and if anything the reliance on convolutional/DL math is less in DLSS 2.0 than it is in original release DLSS (if any at all). It is clear there was a paradigm shift in how DLSS was being designed and implemented - from being actually Deep Learning network that compares scene elements to a model and determines \"what belongs here\" to a pattern based sharpening effect. \n\nSince DLSS is black box we will never know how much it actually relies on \"tensor cores\", but I would be very surprised if end users are really gaining much benefit, if any at all, from the tensor cores. I would instead postulate it is artificially locked behind tensor-core-having cards.\n\nI do think the original DLSS release did legitimately use matrix networks to do content matching.",

      "My main uses are gaming and debugging, I also use it for study/work and watching multimedia\n\nThe AMD drivers are open-source, on [Mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/) which is a set of community driven implementations for APIs such as OpenGL and Vulkan. You have `radeonsi` which is an implementation of the OpenGL API and `radv` which is an implementation of the Vulkan API. \n\nOther than that, there's the [amdvlk](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK) (note: the actual code is on a different repository) implementation, which is an implementation of Vulkan by AMD and also open-source. It's similar to the implementation of Vulkan they use on Windows, so this is useful to debug driver bugs that occur on the proprietary drivers in Windows but not in radv for example.\n\n**For developers**, these are important so as you can accurately report and fix driver issues quickly. Reporting issues on proprietary drivers is hell, as they may take years to fix even the simplest issues or just never fix them at all. I've reported a few issues on `radv` that I found while debugging RPCS3 (a PS3 emulator project I work on) and they were very helpful and fixed these issues in a very reasonable timeframe.\n\nDebugging is also a pain in the ass on proprietary drivers as you don't have the source code nor symbols (which essentially allow you to see the function's names so you can better understand what that code does when you're debugging instead of only memory addresses). When you hit a driver bug, you have a hard time even trying to work it around on your software, let alone figuring out what's wrong.\n\n**For gaming**, you can get faster and more optimized drivers since they're scrutinized by the community, implementations are discussed on public issues and not decided behind closed doors where you have timelines to meet and may just need to fix things quickly as possible. \n\n**I can give a practical example:** when Cyberpunk 2077 released, it was immediately Playable on Proton (I completed it in 12 December, just 2 days after release, only playing on Linux almost non-stop). \n\nThe catch: **only if you had an AMD card with Mesa drivers**. This is because CP2077 has an engine bug that makes the game crash (seemingly randomly, and that doesn't crash the game on Windows by luck) which was worked around thanks to a Vulkan extension made by Valve called `VK_VALVE_mutable_descriptor_type` (drafted way prior to the game's release, it wasn't created for that issue), and Valve's developers had implemented it on Mesa before the game's release (because CDPR gave Valve developers a review copy of the game prior to launch so they could fix issues on Proton) in order to make the game work.\n\nWhy wasn't this possible on NVIDIA drivers? Because they're closed source. Fast forward two months after the release of CP2077 and that extension is still unimplemented in NVIDIA's drivers, and the only way for you to play the game on Linux without the risk of crashing is with an AMD GPU.\n\nI hope this wasn't too confusing, I tried to keep it simple but maybe I can further explain some things that perhaps weren't explained very well."

These are the questions you should ask yourself, and depending on the answers, look at what fits and what's available in your region.",

There are mixed reviews with eBay but they have tons of protections in place for both buyer and seller. They do take a chunk of the money so expect to not get full asking price. They will also ban/lock your account until you physically contact them to verify yourself. At first I was frustrated with it but it definitely goes the extra mile to ensure people aren't being scammed.",

      "people here can't get cards because of other bots and this kind of things\n\nDR must find a way to avoid that\n\nmaybe an early email subscription with lottery will be better than thousand of millions of people and bots going to [amd.com](https://amd.com) only in those 3 minutes\n\nif things will not change we will never be able to buy upcoming gpu",
      "Yeah definitely.\n\nSounds like his queue is super convenient and hassle free. Plus I think it's brilliant that customers who weren't able to buy a card the week before get increasingly higher priority the next round.",

      "This was always going to happen\n\nPeople have been paying scalped prices for years now, that is why scalpers are still here, they're opportunists, and they've been given this opportunity (They don't do it just because, they want to make money)\n\nAnyone who has bought from a scalper cannot be angry about this, because you helped create this situation in your own small way, And tbh it's your fault if you payed an inflated price because you chose to do it out of impatience \n\nThe actual victims are those who can't afford the inflated prices and cant build a PC now because they've been priced out",
      "EVGA still has their queue and people have been waiting since launch to see their name pop up still",

It’s not for lack of trying, it’s really hard to do without some kind of external reputational signal. For steam, that signal can be your spending history and wallet, AMD doesn’t have that sort of data for you.\n\n(The one thing AMD/NVIDIA have access to that could legitimately be useful is driver telemetry data tied to your account but nobody wants to talk about that.)\n\nBut seriously, things that are not actually good ways to ensure one-per-person:\n\n* emails\n* credit card numbers\n* shipping addresses\n* billing addresses\n* names\n* phone numbers\n* ip addresses\n\nTime and again every baby redditor thinks they’ve solved the scalper problem by “just limiting one per credit card” or “one per billing address” and they don’t realize the sneaker market tried that like 15 years ago and scalpers trivially worked around it and found a solution. This is big business, the people who sell the tools make hundreds of grand per year enabling scalping, they have worked around ideas you haven’t even come up with yet.",

      "Definitely? How did you come to this conclusion because it definitely is not. He just doesn't have to deal with what AMD is dealing with. It does not solve anything: It's first come first serve and thats being botted as well. Of course once you're subscribed to his services you have a very convenient experience but that is not what you need to compare to the AMD queue.\n\nHe only let's about 50 people buy a subscription once every while (allthough he has strongly oversold because of technical issues). Combine that with a high successrate and yes, customers will be satisfied.\n\nIf this wasn't exclusive it would be the same mess AMD is dealing with now. The only thing he is doing is moving the issue from the AMD queue-it queue to the people paying him for a subscripion, he actually started using some \"bot protection\" himself because people (scalpers) want a subscription.",
      "I've been on there since later 2020. The cards I signed up for are discontinued so I guess I'm not in any sort of real queue anymore.",

It's almost certain to use TSMC's 4nm process node.\n\nThere's nothing new or controversial in any of that. \n\nAs to having an APU variant with 6750xt levels of performance I see nothing strange or implausible there. \n\nThe 67050XT is a 17 billion TX chip built with TSMC 7nm and pushing \\~13 TFLOPs with board power \\~250 watts.\n\nThe move from 7nm to 4nm brings an \\~80% boost to transistor density and a decrease in power consumption of around 30% (for same clocks). Plus the architectural improvements between RDNA2 -> RDNA3.5 are quite substantial. \n\nCombine that with the rather hefty efficiency gains from unified memory and I can see it fitting within that power envelope.\n\nSo if this is a lie they've decided to go with a perfectly reasonable one.",

To have a uniform access to the entire addressing space you have to use the same modules for the entire vram. That means for a 192bit bus you have total of 192bit/32bit = 6 modules that can either be 1 or 2GB capacity so 6GB or 12GB total. For 128bit bus that is 4 or 8GB.

Early/Mid Ryzen was such a breath of fresh air.

      "I have a 9070 on the way to replace my 6700XT, pretty stoked.",
      "I'll pass for now, 2 years of waiting - RTX 50-series is a scam and RX 9070 is 750€ at the cheapest. I'm not paying that much for a midrange card - the shit is going too far.",
      "Op has some connections",
      "Lol, I was in a panic for the majority of the day yesterday because I'd heard of people having their orders cancelled from other stores and mine had said \"order confirmed\" since Thursday but it finally shipped yesterday evening and then came early this morning. \n\nFeels good to have it here now safe 😂",
      "Yea I dont think people realize 70 tier cards from AMD are now $600+. Yea these are fine cards but mid range cards going up in price means the 80 and 90 tier will also go up in price.\n\nThis is what normalization is when it appears most people are generally happy with a product and the price just because the alternative has just gotten so shitty.",
      "Don't worry dude, you're lucky getting that even haha.\n\nI was thinking about an XT at first and the site crashed where I was browsing and then when it came back up the prices had changed to £539 for the 9070 (only £10 more than before) but the 9070 XT had gone from £569 to £629 which is way too much and apparently that's going to be the new MSRP. Which imo makes the 9070 the better value card since it gets within 10fps on average of the XT and is £100 less almost.\n\nIt's very close to the XT, only \\~11% difference. \n\nEither way it's a massive upgrade from a 6700 XT, you'll be pleased, trust me.",
      "Yeah as u/xxxxwowxxxx said, it's almost twice as fast in raster but WAAAYYYY better than it in RT.\n\nAfter a bit of testing and playing around it wipes the floor with my friends 4070 in the MH Wilds benchmark with no upscaling/FG and settings maxed out including ray tracing. \n\nHis score was: 11782 - Average 24.76 fps - Playable\n\nMine was: 26480 - Average 78.19 fps - Excellent",
      "Night and day difference mate, which model did you get?",
      "What sort of change are you getting?",
      "Man I wish this sapphire version of 9070 could be available as msrp in my place. Love the inoffensive boxy design like this",
      "That's what I'm planning to do as well.... I currently have a 6750 which is a very nice card. The 9070 will be a very good update...",
      "Take a shot every time someone refers to their GPU as a \"beast\"",
      "I’m pretty sure they said that the 9070 XT is the strongest GPU this time around, only a 9060 is coming",
      "Got the same card. Love it! Lots a head room to tweak also.",
      "Have the exact same setup as you down to the CPU and RAM. I'm honestly kinda shocked at how efficient this 9070 Pulse is. Don't think I've seen it break 55c yet, and it's practically silent.\n\nFor a basic MSRP model (not that I got it for that...) with dual fans that's really impressive. My old Gigabyte 3060 Ti was a higher end triple fan model and it was much louder and hotter.\n\nI'm not much of a tinkerer anymore these days but it makes me wonder what kind of gains could be had with some trivial UV/OC on this model.",
      "Agree. Sapphire 9070 is so clean.",
      "Based. These past GPU prices have been a fucking ripoff. $700 used to be the price for the 80ti tier of Nvidia GPU's. The cream of the crop and now it's mid range? Absolute nonsense.",
      "It'll be somewhere near 90%-100%-ish depending on the game, resolution, and settings they're using.\n\nIf he paid the MSRP then its a real solid jump for a decent price."

The cheapest nvidia card to consistently beat mine is the 4070ti, which would of been at minimum $450-500 more than my 6800xt, and it doesn't win by double not even close. For the record I play in 4k.\n\nI paid a little over $500 for my card new.\n\nNvidia can pound sand with its current price to performance.  In the past their premium was worth it because it really wasnt much more price wise and performance was solid, that is not the case today their prices are ridiculous. \n\nThat said my card has been fantastic, no driver issues, has worked great since Ive owned it and a much better menu system with adrenaline. \n\nNvidia is finally getting around to copying adrenaline after a fair number of people shamed them for how poor their software was in comparison. They used two different very slow and old menu interfaces and rely on third party vendors for OC/undervolting tools.",

If AMD ships the XTXH chip for all 6950 XTs it wouldn't be horrible since the premium Navi 21 cards are already more expensive than this.\n\n6750 XT at $549 is BAD, really really bad. %15 price pump would only be justified by a 15% or more increase in performance, which is highly unlikely by only adding faster memory and high clocks without core count change. At this price, the card is approaching the current 3060 Ti market price, the 6700 XT competitor. NVIDIA's feature set is superior and makes a 6750 XT at the same price look very dumb.\n\n6650 XT at $399 is fine I guess. But again, this increase in price should be justified by a proportional performance gains.\n\nAnd a reminder, these prices as shown in the posters aren't \"MSRP\", but the price of the reference models, which definitely are going to be fewer in quantity than AIB models and certainly cheaper.",

As someone who has a low maintenance custom water cooling loop on my main rig, I hate that I always have to buy cards that I immediately remove the cooler from.  I prefer the reference cards because they are the easiest to find a water block for at a reasonable price. I also avoid the special edition models that already include a waterblock not just because of steep price markup that comes with such limited production run SKUs but the issues with everything from QA to likely hood of any firmware issues being addressed after launch.\n\nLet me buy a reference model without a cooler and knock a few bucks off the MSRP.\n\nI really do prefer my custom water cooling loop because it's lower maintenance than air cooling.  I just occasionally run a vacuum over my case air intakes and am good. Years back I got tired of all the enthusiast water cooling hardware and decided to copy data center water cooling by going to AutoZone for [EPDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPDM_rubber) rubber hoses, [crimp clamps](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616u4IFDAvL._AC_SL1000_.jpg), and [gasoila thread sealant](https://www.jmesales.com/gasoila-soft-set-thread-sealants-w-ptfe) .  I just add 30% pure propylene glycol to filtered water and the coolant level never drops due to zero leaks ever. No water reservoir needed because no loss of coolant. No dye or additives and hoses are EPDM rubber so coolant never becomes fouled. Always use fittings and water blocks that are nickel plated so no chance of galvanic issues. I change the coolant every 3 years when I upgrade my system.",

      "Why, when the 7000 series is supposedly around the corner. With a chip shortage, isn’t it better to concentrate on getting the 7000 series out?",
      "Same chip, better memory ICs, this is not a new product, but a minor refresh.",
      "tl;dr: based on AMD's behaviour over the last 7-ish years of GPU launches, AMD will service lower price points with older cards based on RDNA2. RDNA3 will only be used for premium SKUs for maybe 6-12 months.\n\n---\n\nRDNA3 will probably follow AMD's tried and tested strategy of, when they have fast products which can compete with Intel/Nvidia, only having high-end and upper-mid range products at launch. They thus use last-gen parts to service the lower-end market segments for 6-12 months. Recent examples include:\n\n* Ryzen 3000 desktop (Ryzen 2000 was lower-end))\n* Ryzen 5000 desktop (Ryzen 3000 was lower-end)\n* Ryzen 5000U (Zen 2 based APUs were lower-end, not Zen 3)\n* Ryzen 6000U (Zen 3 based APUs were lower-end, not Zen 3+)\n* Threadripper 3000 (TR 2000 and the 3950X were lower-end)\n* Radeon RX Vega series (RX 500 series was lower-end)\n* Radeon RX 5000 series (this didn't even have a top-end, and Vega and RX 500 filled in the gap until the 5600/5500 series)\n* Radeon RX 6000 series (gaps filled by RX 5000, Vega and RX 500, until the 6600 / 6500 XT launched)\n\nAMD aren't Intel; they have about a quarter of the manufacturing capacity, so aren't in a position to flood the market with SKUs top to bottom. AMD have, in fact, not done a top-to-bottom SKU launch on desktop within a launch window since maybe 2010 for CPUs (Phenom II) and 2015 for GPUs (RX 300 series). Every other launch since has either been top-heavy (e.g. Threadripper 3000) or bottom-heavy with no real flagship that can compete against Intel (e.g. 1800X and 2700X were still far slower than the i7-7700K and i7-8700K in gaming).\n\nExpect AMD's late 2022 GPU product stack to look something like this:\n\n* Titan-class prosumer card: \"Rage Fury RX Turbo\" with 2.5x the performance of the 6950 XT\n* Ultra-enthusiast: \"7990 XT\" - 2.2x the 6950 XT\n* High-end enthusiast: \"7900 XT\" - 2.0x the 6950 XT\n* Enthusiast: \"7900\" - 1.7x the 6950 XT\n* Lower enthusiast: \"7800 XT\" - 1.5x the 6950 XT\n* Upper mid: \"7800\" - 1.2x the 6950 XT\n* Mid-range: no 7700 XT at launch, just a cut-down 6950 XT\n* Lower-mid: no 7600 XT at launch, just the 6750 XT\n\nProblem is, all SKU tiers will move up in price. I'd expect the 6750 XT, for example, to be far more expensive than the 6600 XT despite filling the same relative performance tier.",

Put two of them together thanks to MCM, and you're at 400-450W, for 2x the perf. And finally add the RDNA3 improvements and you get a 2.2x or so monster of a GPU. Really not inconceivable, it's just that years of +5% yearly by intel and +30% every couple years by Nvidia made us believe we had reached some sort of wall. That was never the case, the issue was always the lack of incentive for any of these companies to really push the envelope. Now we have AMD delivering on both CPU and GPU sides and look, intel just dropped one of the biggest performance leap in CPU perf of the past 5 years. Of course that wasn't just because of AMD, these architectures take many years to develop but it's no coincidence such a big perf jump happens when they have to defend their marketshare.\n\nNvidia Lovelace is also rumored to be a giant leap (but not quite to the level of RDNA3 because of the lack of MCM)",

      "> It's funny when here people are saying that RTX 3060 is a better choice than RX 6600 XT / 6650 XT in the same price range\n\nBecause it is? Sort of.\n\n\n\nThe 3060 definitely performs slightly worse, but at the same price i'd still go for the 3060 over the 6600 XT/6650 XT due to having more vram, NVENC, better RT performance, and DLSS**. But the catch is, you cant buy them at the same price right now, checking pcpartpicker and the cheapest 3060 is $70 more than the cheapest 6600 XT.\n\nDLSS**, yes FSR 2.0 is out, and its pretty good, but the caveat is its in one title so far, DLSS is in 100+ titles today, and FSR 2.0 games will work on the 3060. Eventually this feature benefit will erode, but right now its still a feature.\n\nCurrent pricing 6600xt is better, same pricing or MSRP the 3060 is better.\n\nPS. HUB came to the same conclusion in their video on this topic, so its not clearly not just fanboys.",

      "Yes, the 3070 at that price is \"highway robbery\". The AiBs who charge a $200 premium for a 2% overclock and a worse looking design are right to be criticized. And when AMD sets an MSRP that is closer to what those AiBs charge, they should receive the same criticism (EDIT: Because I know people are going to point this out, yes, Nvidia started doing the same thing, and yes, they should be criticized for it too).",
      "I honestly don't understand why people use NVENC or RT performance as an offset against worse general performance. It's just not comparable like that, people who don't care about those things don't have a reason to factor them in, and people who do care about them should be picking Nvidia regardless of some small AMD performance advantages.",

Or else just get a 6700xt, it's an excellent GPU.",
      "It costs the same as regular 6700XT in Australia.\n\nOur prices down here are still inflated.",
      "That's not how this works, that's not how any of this works.\n\n2060 has 336 GB/s to VRAM and PCIe3 16x to RAM ( ~16GB/s ).\n\nIt's much faster as long as you stay in VRAM. The moment each frame must access system RAM to render because it can't store it locally you'll see a major performance drop as the GPU is twiddling its thumbs waiting for data from the slow system RAM.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 with RT enabled comes to mind. See: https://youtu.be/U0Ay8rMdFAg?t=643\n\nHad the 2060 been a 8GB card, you would never see that performance drop because the content in VRAM wouldn't be overflowing to the system RAM.\n\nAnd mind you, that's in 1080p. 2060 is also a 1440p card and there the problem would be even worse.\n\nMore VRAM is always good if you can have it.\n\nIt's the same principle when your system RAM is full and your CPU must access the much slower SSD/HDD storage.",

It's why they increased the Ryzen prices across the board by around $50 originally with Ryzen 5000, it's why they didn't ship lower end models of Ryzen CPUs because they can simply milk their customers to buy a more expensive product and it's why they continue to push out graphics cards with prices of $1000+ now. They actually believe that they're a premium brand that can charge those prices. The days of AMD being the \"cheap alternative\" to NVIDIA and Intel are over. In some ways, Intel and NVIDIA provide better value than AMD in a lot of segments now, think 12400F vs R5 5600 and RTX 3050 vs RX 6500 XT. It wasn't until Intel started shipping 12400F's and 12600KF's in droves that AMD pushed the panic button and released the 5700X and 5600.\n\nI get AMD has been successful under Lisa Su, especially architecturally, but mostly business wise. But they're leaving behind their fans that really have been dedicated to them for eons because of their value-oriented approach in the past. If AMD's not careful, a lot of their old fans might abandon them if they keep pushing prices higher and trying to milk every dollar. The Ryzen 5000 price hike was pretty sickening to me, considering that the node was super mature and the die size only very slightly increased on each product compared to Ryzen 3000. I would have bought a R5 5600X but that $50 hike and the fact they took away box coolers just showed me they were doing bean counting to make profits, rather than willing to give their customers value. And yes, I know, the box cooler sucks for products like the 5800X, but that doesn't matter, it was included in the 3800X, so why was it removed? I think purely for bean counting to take $5 off each product's margin for AMD to increase profits. But I want the box cooler in case, I dunno, my cooler has some problem I have some sort of backup, even if the thing is junk, or perhaps, my new cooler takes a while to come or if I need a bracket for AM4 to come in the mail, I can use the box cooler for a while.

These cards should've launched like last September if they wanted to make a splash, back when NVIDIA was launching the 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti etc. The 3090 Ti was extremely late and is a completely dumb product, hell NVIDIA missed their own announcement window in January about more information because the product was so late.",

I immediately did a double and triple take. I was floored by the image, I couldn't put my finger on it, but the sharpness and color, both in games and Windows made me feel like I had just got a new contact lens prescription and a new monitor at the same time. I didn't even know this was a thing until I hopped on Reddit to take a look.\n\nPurely anecdotal evidence but I came in with no knowledge that the image quality would be different on different brands - but out of the box score a BIG win for AMD.\n\nReviewers make huge deals about the software support like DLSS and Ray Tracing, but the number one job of the Graphics Card is to produce an image - and to see that one brand is clearly superior was shocking to me.

      "Good post!\n\nThis was evident 20 years ago, as well, believe it or not.  It was plain to see even then.  It goes all the way back to when 3dfx introduced FSAA to the industry--no one else had it, including nVidia.   Right after 3dfx imploded, ATi came on the scene from literally nowhere with the darkhorse ArtX acquisition GPU, R300, and the GPU did FSAA & general image quality so much better than nVidia that *of course nVidia criticized it heavily* for a couple of years until it could begin to field competitive FSAA GPUs to compete with R300 and beyond.  Despite nVidia's adamant protestations at the time, FSAA became a staple in the industry and is a checkbox feature today for all 3d GPUs, including nVidia's. \n\n nVidia has always been a company absolutely obsessed with frame-rate benchmarks to the exclusion of the best image quality possible.  Considering the number of people who aren't very demanding about their image quality, that approach has sold a ton of GPUs for nVidia.  But you are right--and you aren't the first to have noticed what is often the stark difference between the competing families of GPUs.\n\nIf you care about your image quality, imo, and it's as important to you as frame rates, or even more important (that's me),  you are going to go with AMD.  DLSS is really sort of amusing to me...;)  I game at 4k with a 5700XT (which I will be keeping until I can land a 6800XT at MSRP, and so that might be a long time to come...;))  Anyway, if I want \"DLSS\" I just drop the res to 1440P, pour on the FSAA to a desirable degree--and I'm there...;)  Frame rates go up appreciably and the image quality is but a tad lower than native 4k.  RayTracing?  It is 100% optional in all of the tiny number of games that support it--and many people don't really understand that when you use ray-traced shadows and/or reflections in a given scene/frame, and even ray-trace a few object surfaces, *maybe as much 95% of everything else* rendered on the screen *is still rasterized*, anyway! For instance--every object in every scene is rasterized--none are fully ray traced.  None.    \n\nI don't have anything against DLSS or D3d ray tracing...but as you say, how many game reviewers ever bother to go that deep into the differences between D3d ray-tracing and the kind of ray-tracing special-effects companies rely on for movie production, in programs like Lightwave, for instance?  I cannot think of a single one who really understands the enormous differences.   The differences are *vast*.  But that's OK--D3d RT is what it is.  What's not OK is the idea that D3d RT'ing is *a lot more* than what  it actually is...;)\n\nSo in the final analysis, all of these perceived differences boil down to marketing hyperbole--but you know, it's all in the eye of the beholder in terms of DLSS and D3d RT'ing.  Shown the same exact frames, one guy will opine on how he has never seen anything quite so beautiful, while another will say, \"Meh!  I prefer to turn those features off, myself.\"  \n\nBut in terms of general IQ--comparing the two GPUs on the same monitor in the same games with the same settings on the same desktop--is about as clear as it gets!  Yep, the win is definitely AMD's.",
      "I had a similar experience switching from a 1080 to a 6900xt, something about the image from the amd card is just better and I can't really put my finger on it, obviously the performance is miles better in my case too but even in low motion scenes like just walking around the city in cyberpunk the amd card just made it look more like the trailer than the actual gameplay I got from the 1080",
      "i can't for the life of me find the damn video.. but there was a diagnostic tool for HDMI output bandwidth that measured what was ACTUALLY being sent from the device to the display. And the reason the test was initially conducted was to determine what the problem was with the cables and the display problems to explain them. Coincidentally the person conducting the test was using set top boxes and got a bit curious about graphics cards. Suffice it to say, they discovered that nvidia's hdmi bitrate being spat out to the displays was lower than what AMD's cards were doing which raised a few questions as well as explained why some of the cables were working fine on nvidia's cards while having issues on amd's. 144hz display requiring more data, but nvidia somehow managing to spit out less data while producing the \"same\" refresh rates at the same resolution while AMD was requiring more and resulting in a bad cable producing blanking/flicker/multiple hand shakes or failing to even produce a signal (black screening even). Replacement of the cable with a better own would resolve AMD's issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGranted it's merely a variable. But there is consistently a difference in colour and clarity between the 2 products and always has been. Since the days of the TNT, and nvidia's introduction of Digital Vibrance to combat their lack of shall we say, colour accuracy, kinda like nvidia was stuck with a \"slightly washed out appearance\" is still today a common statement from people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nColour profiles are irrelevant if nothing was setup to begin with and simply attaching one card to the display and another even at the same time (in the case of a highend tv for example) and swapping between both or doing side by side you can CLEARLY see there is differences even at the desktop level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNvidia often opts to go with a limited range via hdmi, 16-255 rather than amd's default 0-255. Manually changing this in the nvidia control panel can/will help but it still doesn't quite match the output amd delivers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's rather strange to be honest. It's certainly not placebo as you get enough customers in which a swap too or from one or the other gets the common utterances when i call in or they do about the displayed image colour/quality differences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've sold an nvidia user and AMD product and they occasionally report that the display looks richer but they can't put their finger on it, and in the opposite case, i sometimes get a complaint from a user that has bought an nvidia card to replace their amd about the display looking washed out somewhat (to which i point to digital vibrance and while it does help, it doesn't usually look right to them)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile we see posts on even this subreddit from users asking where AMD's \"digital vibrance\" is and i can't help but laugh a bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of texture quality and such, AMD certainly tends to have and historically always has had the lead in that, not to mention other effects, Nvidia's often touted frame rate leads can be traced back to things they've done in the past that were proven to be short cuts or optimizations that have impacted visuals either significantly (easily called out), or rather difficult but once compared fairly obvious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI owned a 3080 before getting a 6800xt.... i tried out DLSS and RT and then had the opertunity to compare it to the 6800xt. Honestly no matter how much calibrating i did on the nvidia card, i could never get quite that pop that AMD's cards consistently deliver out of the box every time. I REFUSE to adjust my displays colours and settings to make a video card spit out an image that's comparible, as calibrating the display for nvidia's cards buggers up the other devices and settings i may already have configured. I only had the card for a week and a bit roughly before i dumped it, as i wanted to see how DLSS mostly did and personally seeing the trash it produced on a 65\" 4k display made it completely irrelevant and grossly overhyped. Maybe DLSS3.0 might fix it's glaring problems but it's most definitely not a selling point for me. I'm perfectly happy with a 6800xt spitting out 90-120FPS @ 4k in most of the games i play (or higher).",
      "Back in the day, early 2000's, reviews used to rate 'image quality' and ATi regularly won out by a healthy margin. Rocking a Nvidia card usually led to more washed-out colors and everything looking a bit drab and not as sharp. Never understood why but perhaps that's still the case? I've never done a back to back but I wouldn't be surprised if it was still the case.\n\nI mean, some people have TN monitors and think their colors and image look great. A LOT of people wouldn't be bothered by a slight lowering in image quality for higher performance",
      "Nvidia compresses colors to make up for sloppy optimization. That's why AMD cards have better IQ.",
      "I'm not sure either, but how things look out of the box is important. Might be worth flipping monitors to see but I suspect the difference is in the cards.",
      "It's because amd applies temporal dithering by default on everything while nvidia does not, on windows (works for linux on nvidia)\n\nThe excuse nvidia uses is \"compression is ok as long as the graphics card run faster\"' or something along these lines.  \n\n\nSearch google for nvidia/amd dithering and the same picture quality difference threads will pop up by dozens."

It has a solvent to keep it liquid at room temp, but you are supposed to let it completely evaporate before mounting the cooler. Ideal thickness is \\~0.3mm, and they recommend 15 hours at room temp. The thicker the application, the longer it takes to evaporate.\n\nI wouldn't recommend the paste version.",

It looks like the 8gb models were released in the fall of 2022, nearly two years after the 12gb models which were released in early 2021. There was also a 6gb model released in 2021 with the fully unlocked GA106 utilizing all 3840 shaders of the GA106, according to techpowerup. I think it’s fair to say, though, at least here in the USA, that the 12gb model on the GA106 with a 192-bit bus and 48 ROP is the most common model, and it’s what most people are going to think of when you refer to the 3060. However, it would behoove the consumer to ensure they are getting either of the 12gb versions."

So with high or ultra, the drop is absolutely massive when there are lots of cars on screen emitting smoke or dirt (like going from 100+ fps to 40) it's a slideshow. With medium there's a big gain and it goes at like 70-80 in those moments.

      "I shouldn't see much difference at 1440p if I use a 11400F instead right?",
      "Depends on the game still. In something like cyberpunk where crowds seem to hit the cpu hard you would.",
      "I am glad I managed to secure a 6900 XT while my 6700 XT was being shipped to me. Upgrading from 1080p @60fps to 1440p  @144hz is insane.\n\nYour previous video on the ultrawide 6800 XT + 5600x helped me a lot to justify the purchase of the 6900 XT.\n\nI just don't get why AMD recommends the 6700 XT for 1440p gaming. Sure for 60fps it is solid but anything above depends on the game and what settings you are comfortable to compromise for more fps.\n\nOverall excellent video.",
      "It depends heavily on the game, in most games it'll be fine but some games are more CPU heavy. 11400f definitely has better value than 5600x imo",
      "If the gpu is at 97-98% the difference will be minimal if any, this ofc if the power limit is removed",
      "Meanwhile there’s those random channels that only shows bar graph and it just looks skeptical",
      "I have a Sapphire Nitro+ 6800XT and it is Awesome for 1440/144. 6800XT runs 1440/144 buttery smooth. Doesn't break a sweat.",
      "This comment should be renamed - user that doesn't know the basic and usually has unstable overclocks and then blames gpu drivers",
      "Hey, i mean, why would you use a lower resolution when this card can play most games at 1440P around 100 fps? I see no sense in there. Also, releasing the OC/UV tutorial in some minutes ;)",
      "Dude I intended to get a 6800 XT but it was impossible to get one for MSRP. I was lucky to grab the 6900 XT slightly above MSRP from a guy who accidentality ordered two. The 6900 XT was a bit overkill for my use case but I will take that over scalper prices",
      "Thanks, i get it. That's why you have timestamps. Live stats are always better for this, charts are for the gpu and cpu comparisons :D",
      "For the price it’s at now a days, yeah",
      "I run a  5800X with the 6700 XT. It's brilliant.",
      "Thanks for the words",
      "Thank you",
      "I agree. I really wanted the Sapphire Nitro+ 6900XT to pair with my 5900X but I have zero regrets or qualms with my 6800XT",

    "selftext": "Hey all.\n\nI'm planning to upgrade from my current laptop (i5-2430M, Radeon HD 6470M, 8gb DDR3-1333) to something faster. Way faster.\n\nI'm torn between these two cards (RX 7700 XT and RX 6750 XT). I have heard something about the RX 7000 series being better for productivity than the RX 6000 series, I don't know if this is true.\n\nThe price difference between these two cards is 63 euro.\n\nI'm planning to use it for Unreal Engine, Unity, Godot and Blender. I don't know much about these programs since I have never used them before.\n\nDoes anyone know how much more the RX 7700 XT is better than the RX 6750 XT for game development and 3d work?",
    "comments": [
      "Between those two I'd say the 7700 XT is the better choice, but you can't go wrong with either. AMD cards will do fine in all of those but Nvidia is just superior in blender thanks to CUDA.  I've done unity dev work on a 6800 XT and it was perfectly fine. \n\nIn all honesty, except for blender your CPU matters more than your GPU with these tasks- Unity will use all the threads you can throw at it when compiling and if choosing the 6750 XT over the 7700XT gives you the budget to go for an 8-core chip instead of a 6-core chip, do it.\n\nThat being said i agree with the other commenter, a used RTX 3080 10GB is the best value in that price range right now. Those that work are well within the valley of the bathtub curve and you'll probably get at least 5 years out of a used one. (Just maybe avoid the zotac trinity model of the 3080 those are cheaper for a reason)",
      "Excuse my ignorance but aren’t nvidia cards better at these tasks?",
      "used 3080",

      "All this info is very helpful, thank you!\n\nBoth options feature a Ryzen 7 7700.",

      "They are said to be, yes.",
      "I don't really know about buying used. It's quite risky.",
      "Might be, yes.\n\nAlthough the best nVIDIA card that fits in my budget (430 euro) is the RTX 3060 12gb, what costs 290 euro here.",
      "Well productivity wise nvidia seems like your best bet. Although I don’t do any of these tasks and only game, so I went with AMD. But for productivity go for nvidia. Where are you from? 430 for a 3060 seems a bit steep imo.",
      "Less than you'd think. the biggest risk is the lack of warranty",
      "Bro Actually sometimes 7900xtx performs similar to 4060ti in Productivity so it will be better to research if AMD support those applications. It's all on your applications.",
      "I'm from the Netherlands btw.\n\nI mean't my max. Budget for a gpu is 430. The 3060 12gb costs 289 at a minimum here.",
      "I'm afraid when the buyer protection of the platform is over, That then for some (random reason) the gpu dies, and I've then lost a lot of money.",
      "Yeah, I'm researching. But it's quite difficult to find a benchmark or anything for Unreal, Unity and Godot.\n\nAtleast I found out that the RX 7700 XT is quite close to the RTX 3060 on blender.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\tMedian score:2147.17\tNumber of benchmarks:411 AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT\tMedian score:2128.77\tNumber of benchmarks:59\n\nSource: [opendata.blender.org](https://opendata.blender.org/)",
      "Thats an idea. Yes, you may need the VRAM. You may want more modern features though. Just a thought.",
      "That doesn't really happen with GPUs a ton UNLESS they've been reflowed. If they've lasted 2 years, they'll probably last another 5 if cared for properly.",
      "I have had a used 3080 for 2 years with no issues. I always buy used cards. No risk and way more performance per dollar.",
      "If possible try the things physically at a Centre near you. Whichever satisfies you buy it... I think this suggestion is sounds good but I don't know if the seller can let you check these things.... Gamers love AMD but Nvidea shifted focus to AI...."

Some games can really suffer from the 8gb not all though. The 7600xt and 3060 12gb are about the same speed, the 3060 has the benefit of dlss. The 7600xt 16gb seems nice but it's not really fast enough to play games in a scenario where you would need it. \n\nTldr: I would get the 6750xt if you can still find it for a good price.",

Tried it at 4k with Space Marine, and managed an average 60 on low and medium settings with quality upscaling. Most other titles are 100+ fps ultra at 1080.\n\nNot telling you to trust my feedback alone, but I debated my options at length during the building process, just check my post history. The 6750 XT smokes the rest of your options if NVIDIA luxuries are not needed. I purchased at $320, and given the market at the time, it was evenly priced with the rest. I don't know how prices have fluctuated, but be aware that the 7700 XT has come down to $350, and if it's within your budget, you should pick that up instead, if the price difference isn't significant.",

With so many different brands of monitors with different specs it's basically luck of the draw.\n\nThis applies to both AMD and Nvidia. RDNA3 does seem to have extra issues with absurd idle power use but RDNA2 does not, at least nothing worse than Nvidia.",

The level will vary on the hardware in the configuration why it can strike just about anyone if they have hardware that wasn't accounted for.\n\nIt's a nice big can of worms.",

It only clicks to 60Hz if you're getting 60FPS in which case you're not gonna notice anyway. \n\nYou should always enable it. It's literally called Adaptive Sync, so you do NOT need smooth 144FPS at all. \n\nIt's V-sync that has certain negative effects.",

A $500 6800XT will serve you well. If that's out of your budget you can try the used market, or the 6700XT, also a GPU that handles 1440P high FPS gaming well.

I seem to have won the jackpot at 50-200Mhz VRAM clock at 7 watts.\n\nIt seems to be total luck of the draw regarding your monitor combinations, for both Nvidia and AMD. RDNA3 does have extra issues but RDNA2 is the same. Nvidia cards can also experience higher idle power consumption depending on the monitors.",
      "Are you saying that memory clock max is a bug?\n\nAlso those fixes aren't universal. In the OP's case it would be enabling freesync. That's when it idles. I had the opposite experience for example, inhzd to disable freesync on all monitor osd's to make it idle"

Dlss advantage is very marginal, *slightly* wider support for now, quality basically the same. At this price point, I'd go for whichever card offered more raster performance for the price. Driver issues are very difficult to quantify either way. The best you can do is look for widely reported issues in games or software that you use a lot; ie that matter to you.",

Even the Unreal 2 demo is flaky with frame rates. I didn’t care about that, I just wanted to take advantage of my ultrawide 1440 monitor. And for non-RT it does a very good job at that.\n\nWhile newer games will drive temperatures higher than the RX 580, older games tend to run cooler in my experience. Plenty of ventilation in your case is still a good idea. \n\nBe sure to enable SAM on your motherboard, it really makes a difference in performance with the 6650 XT. Especially with preventing stutters and drops. \n\nFSR is pretty neat too, it definitely ups your frame rates for more demanding games. Just understand that thick vegetation and stuff like that can really break the upscaler, so if the graphics start looking chunky, that’s the first thing to adjust. \n\nHope that helps!",

The card crashing because it, for example, hit a bad voltage dip while the VRMs shift gears during a game launch, can also cause that if it falls short of completely crashing the system.\n\nHave you attempted to underclock the core and especially VRAM? Also, what PSU are you using? Any problems not caused by the GPU itself being bad will continue to haunt a newer GPU, often worse due to the architectures being more sensitive to electrical antics.",

A few things you may want to investigate:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Does your system support Smart Access Memory (SAM)? It can produce a small gain in specific titles.\n* What resolution is your display? If it's at least 1440p you may be able to use FSR with little visual degradation (in Quality) to get a bit more juice out of your card (or run it more quietly if you're maxxed out in framerate). This goes double for 4k, where the technology really excels, IMO.\n* I've personally found the open source Linux drivers to be quite stable; not sure if there's an open source Windows equivalent.\n* Have fun!",

By undervolting you can cut power usage by a decent amount while keeping the same/better performance. This resets every driver update so make sure you export a profile after you're done tuning and reapply it after you update.",

I turned it on once not expecting too much, and it turned out to just seamlessly let me play while eating less power.\n\nAlso, Adrenalin offers customised settings per game. Depending on what you play, you may want to sometimes activate Chill, other times Boost, and so on. Enjoy!",
      "Out of those options, you should definitely be looking at the 6800xt for a reasonable upgrade over a 2080ti.  I upgraded from a GTX 1080 at the start of this year to a 6800xt and I've been thrilled with the performance.  It's over double the performance of my 1080, and more importantly, should perform well for the next few years.  As far as coil whine goes, it's luck of the draw.  All I can tell you is my own experience.\n\nI bought an XFX 6800xt Merc, and I'm running it on an 860w Platinum PSU.  My card had light coil whine, which got drowned out as soon as any fans started to spin up seriously.  Five months later, and all coil whine is either gone, or so slight that I can't hear it.\n\nI would highly value performance over some coil whine, but it obviously bothers some people more than others.  In \"most\" cases, if cards do have coil whine, it tends to eventually shake out and quiet down, assuming there isn't a power issue of some kind.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla is about the only triple-A game I can find at short notice that doesn't have it.\n\nPeople have been saying it wasn't in many games for a long time, but guess what, we only get a few big game releases a year! It's been in the majority of releases for some time now. In fact, its got to the point where its more likely to be in the game than not.\n\nOn the flip side, AMD FSR is literally just a lanczos upscale with sharpening, you're welcome to check that in the source. Which is why below 4k it performs very poorly. In fact if you compile the dev version of [Magpie](https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie) you can try it and upscale any game you like! Just set to windowed borderless and choose a lower resolution and it will upscale the image using FSR.\n\nThat said, its not exactly all that much better than existing upscaling. I played with it myself but for example in Fortnite it didn't really provide much of an increase in quality over the traditional upscaler.\n\nThreatened? No, wanting to comment when people have massive double standards? Yes.\n\nFSR has its uses, but comparing to DLSS is just not something its in a position to do.",
      "DLSS Almost indistinguishable in blind tests with minimal ghosting in edge cases- 'Complete garbage, looks terrible \\*downvote & harass\\*'\n\nFSR Significantly worse image quality, blurred but overall pleasing image - 'No pixel peeping boys! Wow so good! Just don't zoom in or analyse, most people can't tell the difference! A\\*'\n\nThe sub of double standards.",
      "About the same as DLSS performance mode going by the amount of blurring going on over the whole image, especially the sidewalk, but its very very noticeable. The end result is still usable though. That said, this sub has spent months trying to destroy DLSS even when results were far better than this, so to hold this to the same standards would mean its terrible.\n\nThat said, it does look comparable to DLSS performance mode, which is far faster.",
      "there's a very clear loss of detail without zooming or pixel peeping. I had to look closer, but I can definitely tell the difference.\n\nI made sure to not look at which was FSR/Native when I opened the link and I guessed the one that's native.\n\nLook at the mini map, there's lines missing in the FSR side, that's an easy example to compare.\n\nEdit: look towards the white light, and the black stuff has clear detail loss. You have to look at static sections of the scene. Since the comparison shot isn't the same image, you have to do that.",
      ">A little oversharpened to my eyes\n\nCheck again, the oversharpened is the native one. We got baited since the positions are switched compared to video, FSR is on the left while Native is on the right.",
      "Yeah it’s hard to spot differences in a 4k image with 1080p video on my phone…",
      "Better than the comparison image posted here by my reckoning! The base game has ghosting in it to quite a degree because it uses TAA, which is still there with FSR, FSR just runs on top of it.\n\nThat said, using the newer DLSS 2.2 dll file give better results. For the most part though, even gamers nexus hailed it as extremely impressive, and the LTT DLSS blind comparison video showed that most people can't tell the difference either.\n\nLegitimately the ultra quality pre-set looks similar to the DLSS performance pre-set in many cases, especially at 1440p where FSR does far worse.\n\nI'll just have to disagree with you, coming from someone who has a 3060Ti and a 6800XT, of which the 6800XT is sat in its box not being used.",
      "I meant with the open source driver (Radv). Last time I checked CP2077 froze after the menu with the pro driver.",
      "https://github.com/andrewcs0901/Magpie/releases/tag/v0.5.1",
      "Right you are, my bad. Just goes to show how close they are if it comes down to personal preference.",
      "Calm your tits my dude, I actually quite like FSR and am not looking to trash it. One of the images looks overly sharp to my eyes, just turns out it's not the one I expected.\n\nHaving said that, I've played Cyberpunk on a 4K TV from a distance, thought it looked great, and then played it much closer on a UWQHD display and thought it looked crap. The game natively has this amazing ability to look fuzzy in some places (NPC character models seems to suffer with this) whilst overly sharp in others (like ground textures, for some reason)."

Once that cache is built it should be very fast.  If anyone has questions, ask away!",

It does not inspire confidence or development work when AMD's CUDA equivalent still does not run on two year old hardware, and is only barely starting to work for the current gen.  From what I've seen, PyTorch has actually been doing a rather good job of supporting both APIs.  The reason the patch was necessary is all the old ROCm cards had a warp size of 64, whereas these new ones are more like NVIDIA cards with 32.  Overall it's very new and untested.",

While at it they explained how to update the OS version and firmware, managed to bork it while upgrading it and spent a couple of hours restoring it.\n\nI personally never had a Linux experience that was fire and forget, except running live CDs or anything else prepackaged that doesn't need any installation or updates.\n\nStill, that doesn't invalidate what I said before.

What I had to do was manually edit the CMakeLists.txt file in each component of ROCm to only say \"gfx1030\" instead of all of the other ones, as well as replacing the name in the ifdef sections.  However, pytorch would still not work..  I found a pull request titled \"[ROCM] query warp size for host code, do not use C10_WARP_SIZE #67294\" and decided to try it out.

Ended up being completely false.\n\nWhen someone said that 4070 was $750 ($50 below the $800 MSRP of 4070ti).

When the new gen came out the new generation would cost a touch more for the same performance. Typically, they would have lower power and new features to justify costing a bit more. So, a 7600 at $300 probably performs a little bit worse than a 6700XT at raster, and at least about the same ray tracing.\n\nIf that plays out, we should be dealing with a bunch of posts along the lines of \"should I buy a 6700XT for $x or a 7600 $y?\" And, there will be no right answer.",

I figured that MSI would be a reputable brand and most variants perform within 1-2% of each other generally. Definitely an upgrade over my previous GTX 1070 and lets me utilize my 1440p monitor. I think the thing I like the most besides the performance increase of the upgrade is the Software. I had no problems with my 1070 but it felt like a chore every time i had to open up GeForce or control panel compared to opening up Adrenaline which feels more intuitive and user friendly. The price and performance of Intel Arc does interest me but I hear that some older games dont work well and the software still needs development.",
      "Is this at 1440p?",
      "Got the same card. Limited it around 1500 rpm which makes it quieter but you can still hear it. (Thing ships with 100% fanspeed for like 65 degrees? Wtf?)\nTemps tough are quite good.(even with tamed fans)\n\nSadly mine got coil whine but i almost always wear my headset while playing, so its not the end of the world.\n\nPlaying at 1080p 144hz and recently upgraded my rx 5700 non xt to  a 6700xt and my 3600 to 5700x.",
      "Cool beans.",
      "A lot of times corruption comes from memory errors. You could run it at stock settings and see if it still happens.",
      "Thanks. I have installed latest adrenalin driver and turned off GFXOFF using MPT. I haven't noticed any problems yet while using my pc with low gpu usage (its been around 3 hours now). Hopefully its fixed now.",
      "I have mine fot around a month now and im quite happy with it (still the coil whine is a bit annoying)",
      "3700x and 5700x its been fine so far",
      "Power Color Red devil 6700xt, performs very well, and had no problems at all..\n\nNoise is almost silent because i undervolted it..  1105mv with 2600 gpu and 2100 mem? i can't remember.. temps are around 60/65 when i play games.",
      "I just bought a sapphire pulse rx 6700 xt. Playing with D2R 1440p maxed settings about 90-110 fps and 65-70C gpu and 90-100C hot spot temps, depends on the area. Everything fine so far. Stock settings for the card. One more thing its very silent cant hear in closed case and zero coil whine. So its a very good card i think."

      "Prices have gone up the last couple months sadly. I picked up my 7700XT for $350 during the summer. The 6800XT was around there too. Currently though, the 6750XT is solid for that price. A used RTX 3070 would be a good choice as well, just keep in mind it's only 8gb. If you plan on going 1440p in the future, i would skip a 3070",

Under full load, the core never goes past 55c. Memory and hotspot sits closer to 70c. It can get loud under full load, but a 2 fan card would be even louder.",

I'd pay the extra $40 for a significant performance jump.\n\nAs for the motherboard, considering you have the Fractal North and you don't wish to install a micro ATX board, go for the MSI B650 Gaming Plus Wifi for $170.\n\nHowever if we're talking most value for money, that would be the AsRock B650M PG Lightning Wifi (micro-Atx) for $120. It's good enough for a 9800x3d.\n\nPrices seem to be high across the board and many items are out of stock - so these are the decent options I could find.\n\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/JDxq6D",

      "I actually wanted that board but the prices and availability are horrible right now. I was seriously contemplating the microcenter deal with the 7600x, gigabyte b650 auros, and 32 gb of g skill ram for like $450. I already have the case and a PSU.",
      "Any cheaper bundles?\n\nHow much is the 7600x3d bundle?",
      "Thanks for the info!",
      "Sorry I misspoke. They have 7700x (not 7600x) with either the gigabyte gaming x ax b650 ($400) or gigabyte auros elite ax ice b650 ($440). Both come with the same gskill ram. They don't officially list the 7600x3d bundle anymore since it's out of stock but i believe it was around $450\n\nCheaper they have the 7600x or 9600x with asus b650-a prime ax 2 for $300 and $330 respectively. Or you can upgrade and get it with asus b650m tuf gaming for $340 and $370.",
      "The asus prime is a mediocre motherboard, I'd recommend going for the 7600x + B650M Tuf Wifi bundle for $340. I'm hoping the RAM is 6000Mhz and not 5600Mhz.\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/qnKpHW](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/qnKpHW) \\- Similar equivalents are $400 if bought seperately.\n\nIt's not worth paying extra for the 9600x. Spend the $30 on a decent air cooler like the Peerless Assasin or the ID Cooling A620.\n\nThe Gigabyte Gaming X AX is one of the better boards out there and going for a more premium board is not worth it. If you want an ATX board, the 7700X bundle for $400 is pretty decent.\n\nThe $70-$100 price difference between the 7600x and 7700x bundles are significant enough to jump to a higher tier GPU. For example you can get a 7800XT for $480 instead of a 7700XT ($400)."

    "selftext": "Currently have an i5 11400, 32gb ram and a 3060 gpu with a 600watt psu.  I'd prefer to keep total costs around 400.  Mainly play fortnite, halo infinite, COD... just got an Asus tuf vg27aq3a (1440P, 180hz) that I'd like to max out or just be able to play at 1440p and at least 120fps without issues.\n\nGiven this, which should I go with?  Look like prices are $359 for the 6700xt, $429 for the 6800, and $489 for the 6800xt... however I believe for the 6800xt I'd need to spend another $100 on a PSU upgrade no?\n\nSo $359, $429 and $589?  I'm not looking for bleeding edge tech as I have a series x and ps5, just looking to add a good 3rd option for our family where I don't have to fiddle with settings and can just set and forget at good resolution/fps.\n\nUpdate - After some good feedback I've decided to stay put for at least another 2 years with my 3060.  At first I thought it was my GPU causing the issues which started this whole thread.  Apparently the epic games launcher was set to stream the graphical assets in fortnite, which explained why the first game would stutter but subsequent games were smooth.  I went ahead and checked the box to download the 30gb's or so and boom...1440p, epic quality and runs at no less than 90fps.  \n\nSo yea, I'm just going to hold off for at least 2 years.  Thanks!",

      "I would say 6800xt. 6700xt would be best value but would not be a substantial upgrade from 3060. Especially if you want 1440 p at 120fps.",
      "I have been researching similar and I am upgrading from a budget build. I am finding that the 6700xt is the best value for the dollar when on sale. However the 6800's have 16gb ram I think. Benchmarks I saw put the 6800xt about 20% faster than the 6700xt. So you can try to search for a price that justifies that 20% gain or not.",
      "Thanks!  Okay so I'm now between the 6800xt and the 7800xt. Both are the same price.... What should I go with?  And any reco on the PSU?",
      "No, no. Your at 1440 so i think your cpu will be fine for that resolution, not for 1080.\n\nHeres the deal, u want your jump from 3060 to next, to be substantial and u ideally want a gpu that can push 1440 to high refresh in future games too.\n\nThats why Id say 6800 as minimum but the 6800xt is a good deal more performance to last u longer, ive had both actually.  \n\nI would also not be trying so hard to keep a psu.  Ran my 6800xt for two yrs on 700w also.  Were it not for transient spikes, id try it on 600w maybe power limited. But bottom line, psu not that expensive.",
      "7800xt, its a better performing card.",
      "Agreed, 6800 or maybe 6800xt would be the best for longevity. However if you don't want to also spend more for a power supply. My 6700XT keeps me happy at 1440p. I don't expect that to last forever with newer games but I'm not exactly playing the latest titles either. \n\nTbh, you might find more stability with a higher wattage power supply anyway, even the 6700xt,  say 750 atleast. Depends on quality of current unit.",
      "6800xt!",
      "Upgrade to a 6700xt hardly seems worth it, especially at current prices. \n\nThe 7700xt at $421 and 6800 at $409 on Amazon don't seem too bad.\n\nThe 7800xt I'd say is a better deal than the 6800xt. 60w less power and a similar price. I think I've seen $480 or $490 recently.",
      "The 6800XT is, of course, the best option for your immediate and future wants and needs but yeah... I tested mine, 700W suggested, in gf's PC (5600X, 750W PSU and usually a 3070) It did ok but 600W isn't doing it, even with tweaks aso. Fwiw I used the 6800XT (in my PC) with a 5800X and a 1000W PSU that's also fine for a 7900XTX's appetite. If you take the 6800XT/new PSU route I'd suggest at least 850W to cover you for any later upgrades on a similar scale.\n\nAs for perf, my 6800XT was a 3440x1440 card 3 years ago but since then has been written down to 1440p for more recent AAA's approaching the kind of frame rates you're looking at with any real longevity (and short of cutting settings hard as you go on) For the other cards there's somewhat less compromise re the PSU (600W base for both) but more for the performance. All are fine cards at their respective levels though with the 6700XT's 12Gb being the lowest cap I'd use for 1440p and the 16Gb of the others offering some buffer.",
      "How much are you going to sell your 3060 for? Does that change anything? Because as of now I wouldn't upgrade the 3060 to any of these if I was just paying the prices you're saying for them and not getting any of it back.\n\nI see it like this, with that 3060 you should already be able to get 1440/120 in those games with tweaking settings/dlss and the only one you're going to be able to max out and still be at 1440/120 is cod with the 6800/xt which you should upgrade your psu for making it even harder to justify. There aren't really any cards capable of consistently comfortably maxing out games at 1440/120 aside from the 4090. Even the 4070 super which is another $100 more than the 6800xt at least in the US only runs at around 1440/90 using dlss in Fortnite at max settings.\n\nThat PC should already be a good match for the performance level of the PS5/xsx as it generally performs similarly but with the benefits of better rt and dlss.",

      "Oh nice, thanks for the input!  Yea I mean $359 seems pretty good, considering I have a 600watt psu and it's max draw is 230 watts. With my i5 that puts it around 300-400.  Really didn't want to incur an additional cost for that.\n\nYea and like you, I'm coming from a semi-budget build, but also want a good price/value ratio.  Curious what graphics card did you upgrade from?",
      "Ohhh I didn't even consider bottlenecking..... Crap.  So then what about the 6700xt vs 6800 non xt?  Or still a bottleneck?",
      "650 watt  recommended min per AMD.",
      "Any bottle neck issues?",
      "So I just looked it up... Wow!  Yea same price.  So 7800xt seems like the winner.  Any PSU reco for that?",
      "Yeah that's a good point. So I wasnt looking to be fairly aggressive with the 3060 sell it for about 200.  Must used ones seem to be going for 250.  My rationale is I also want to future proof my rig as a have a 14 and 11-year-old, so trying to get something that would run 1440p at 120 for the next 4 to 5 years.  \n\nThat being said, yeah your point remains. I booted up Halo infinite and had no issues whatsoever.  I guess I was a little nervous because fortnite was stuttering which threw me off.  Then after some research I realized I guess it's prone to do that?  Anyway, with 200 back would you still recommend moving forward with the 7800 XT and PSU or no?",
      "And you'd reco that over my 3060?  Worth the upgrade?"

So they set a super high voltage to get the highest yields (working units divided by total units), but by definition it's excessive for most of the units.\n\n\"Undervolting\" is reducing this voltage while keeping the clocks the same. This can actually *increase* performance as the card has more thermal headroom and can thus hit those clocks more, as well as free up thermal headroom for the memory and reduce load on power delivery (further efficiency gains). By reducing heat you also reduce CPU temps so it may boost more aggressively.\n\nAdditionally, the clock targets tend to also be set quite high, and there are steep diminishing returns to having higher clock speeds. So you can also reduce those clock targets which allows you to reduce the voltage further. You may lose a little performance but less than you think.\n\nFor example, by reducing clocks and voltage I was able to cut power consumption by nearly 20% and only lost ~3% performance on a 5700 XT. [See this user](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/dgkfyb/more_undervolting_results_on_a_reference_5700xt/)\n\nEdit: Another thing is that silicon quality *increases* over time, but to my knowledge the stock voltage settings are not changed or set per card.

      "Yes, and rumor has it that the 7xxx series is supposed to be at least $50 dollars more than these MSRP. Simple answer is, don't buy them. I realize that may not be an option for some people but the only way to get the point across that we won't be gouged to death for corporate profits is to not buy the cards.",
      "Sure, but at this stage, AMD is losing marketshare at a rather alarming rate. Intel hasn't even entered the space yet either, AMD should be fighting tooth and nail to keep as much marketshare as they can before Intel enters, because you can bet your bottom dollar, Intel's strategy will be to target the mainstream market which is where AMD is currently succeeding. \n\nIntel will simply outprice AMD and NVIDIA to gain marketshare and then what will AMD have to show for it, AMD's fanbase primarily buys based on value in dGPU, so once Intel provides better value why choose AMD? AMD can't beat NVIDIA in sales in the high end halo market due to NVIDIA's mindshare and they also can't beat them in the midrange sector where NVIDIA will simply out-ship and out-market them. Adding Intel into the mix only puts AMD in a tough position, so they better believe they're gonna have a problem when Intel starts putting out cards at cost price or at a loss just to get marketshare.\n\nThe only saving grace for AMD is that they will be able to match NVIDIA for performance or slightly beat them or slightly lose to them in a particular segment, but that matters very little because AMD's had that advantage for years and still cards like the GTX 1060 out-shipped the RX 480/580 and RX 470/570 combined. AMD for whatever reason can't penetrate the market towards gamers, despite their business being slightly profitable in terms of margins. I think it really has to do with their marketing, it's cringe, Radeon Rebellion is a good example of just cringe marketing. Then you have situations like Vega where they hyped it up only for it to release later than the GTX 1080 by a year and match it in performance. I'm happy those days are a bit behind AMD but they also don't seem to not market very effectively. NVIDIA's name is plastered everywhere in net cafes, at eSports events, they will send parts to streamers to promote stuff, they will even work with Intel on overclocking records etc. AMD does none of that because they're too stubborn or too stupid to. AMD's marketing \"hype\" is to put RDNA2 in Fortnite, which isn't their target market for starters and especially when Fortnite was losing popularity too... It's not even comparable the two types of marketing, NVIDIA is simply better in that area, even if NVIDIA imo is disingenuous, they simply will put their name out there more effectively.",

      "this looks utterly atrocious",
      "The whole point of a refresh is to offer better performances at the same price",
      "Be aware that we've been told by multiple sources that the initial wave of 6650 XT stock has been subsidized by AMD in quite a few regions, so I'd wait a little bit before making any conclusions regarding pricing.\n\nThat said if they are going to continue to keep selling the 6650 XT at the same prices the 6600 XT's were available when why make the price hike official? Not a good look for AMD if that's the case. Ideally at this point you'd want the MSRP to be $20 lower, not higher :D",
      "If you check Newegg there actually isn't a price increase. There's 3 models in stock for 400 right now, which is the same price AIB's were selling the 6600 XT for and also the MSRP of the 6650 XT\n\nWhat I think happened is AMD is stealing the scalper margin from AIB's with this card. The price AMD (and Nvidia) charges AIB's for GPU dies is based on MSRP. However, the 66X0 cards do not have a reference model, so AIB's decide the actual selling price. AIB's were basically buying dies from AMD with the 380 MSRP in mind and then scalping them to 400.\n\nWe saw this before with the 2060. Nvidia reduced the MSRP to 300, but after quickly selling off their remaining FE's, they never restocked them. That means AIB's were free to set the actual selling price so the *actual* cost of a 2060 was 320-340. But AIB's got the dies from Nvidia with the 300 dollar MSRP in mind.\n\nAMD (and Nvidia) likely set the contracts up this way because in a normal market, the selling price for the card would be around their MSRP. Both companies do not have the scale of AIB's to produce PCB's and the other needed components, so they're reliant on them, especially for the cheaper models. Which is why that compromise was historically left in. But obviously AIB's took that little loophole and *ran* with it over the past two years.\n\nSo AMD just set the MSRP at what the actual selling price would be to be more honest and get more from AIB's. So this is actually a net positive for gamers oddly enough because they're now getting a *faster* card for the same price as before.\n\nThe issue is the reviews didn't know that this would happen since they can't see the future so they all come off as negative. Even though this card is actually a net positive for gamers. But imo the price jousting is pretty interesting from a business perspective.",
      "Their mindset has always been the same...the only difference is that now they can get away with more due to the high demand.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that this is a trash refresh that add nothing to the current generation so people have all the right to be pissed off.",
      "It looks like the 6600 XT is getting discontinued but the 6700 XT and 6900 XT will still be around. Good news is that multiple models of the 6650 XT are in stock for MSRP (399) at Newegg so it's actually overall an improvment.\n\nThis card looks like AMD stealing the scalper margin from AIB's without changing the street price for people.",
      "Market share doesn't matter if your margins are still massive. Losing sales/market share isn't always a bad move if you can charge more % wise.",
      "This wouldn't be the product to gain marketshare back though, and certainly not at this stage, perhaps 4/5 months out from the next generaton. \n\nAlso desktop GPUs is one of AMDs lowest priority product categories.",

This is just my opinion but I don't see parity with Nvidia in rasterization as the incredible achievement it's being made out to be here. AMD had a huge opportunity while Nvidia sandbagged in favor or profit using what is essentially a 10nm node and still came up short. They will take a beating next go around.",

The Corsair RM series is a solid, basic, gold-rated PSU.  For an RX 6800, you shouldn't have an issue at all.  For an RX 6800 XT, so long as you didn't go ham with the power limit, and especially if you locked clocks to say, 2500MHz, and undervolted, I don't forsee you having issues.\n\nSpeaking in general, a few good \\*rough\\* feeler gauges of PSU quality are:\n\n\\- Price of the unit, compared to...\n\n\\- The max wattage rating, the max single-rail 12V amperage rating\n\n\\- The length of the warranty.\n\n\\- And the efficiency rating (though this is MUCH less important than the previous two items)\n\nRe: Warranty.  The warranty length is telling you the general quality of the electronics components used within a particular unit.\n\nMy rules of thumb are: A gold-rated PSU with a 5-year warranty is the \\**BARE*\\* minimum I would ever consider, and I would *only* buy it if there were NO other PSU's with a 7+ year warranty available.\n\n7-year warranties are the bog-standard for decent-quality Gold-rated PSU's.

I did not yet beat my TimeSpy scores but those where pretty crazy anyway (16 837 GPU Score). I get almost reference XT performance with OC. Non demanding titles dont even activate the fans.

Otherwise the reference cooler is good enough even for top 100 scores. There is always risk of damaging something. Imagine being me after switching the cooler, trying to boot and get \"AGP Error\" beeps with my old vega (swapped the cooler) and the new 6800.

      "Nice to see that it works! I had a Morpheus II on my 1080 Ti. It was a Inno3D X3 ultra edition, but the cooler was bad. Always had temps at 80c and the card would throttle. With the Morpheus II and two ML120 fans my temps dropped to 52c and clocks were stable at 2050Mhz, while staying silent.\n\nFor the Radeon 6800 series I think the Morpheus 8057 is a better option than the II. The heatsink dimensions on the 8057 are 40x38mm vs 40x32mm on the II. You'll have better coverage on the core with the 8057.",

How things are going we may be looking at throwing the 69XT to bin in a year or two if all new AAA games come out with RT stuff like CB2077 as RDNA2 is currently quite week with RT. If nothing major happens in the software department it is more than likely that RDNA3 will be way more powerful with RT, like double or triple, and at this point the RDNA2 cards are quite literally struggling.\n\nSo bearing this in mind we need to look at the price vs performance vs longevity formula. And if all RDNA2 cards will be scrap when next gen hits, in a year or two, then getting the cheapest option is the wisest decision, unless you are sleeping on piles of money, then of course get the best there is everytime.",

Personally I \"want\" an 6800XT but REALLY cant justify upgrading the 5700XT, its not twice as fast at 1440p and ray-tracing performance are 2070-2080 levels, so logical thing would be to wait a gen.. but hey, who does that \"logical\" thing.",

      "DLSS is fantastic, game changing technology, and I'm a huge fan of it!  But at the same time, if Ray Tracing is going to grow more complex with time (and I imagine it will) then DLSS will have to make similar advances in performance to compensate for the extra processing.  \n  \nNow to be fair DLSS could improve more quickly than Ray Tracing does, and if that's the case then yeah, 2020's RT cards are going to hold out a bit longer.... but when one has to depend on *two* technologies at once to get a playable framerate, that creates potential negative conflicts and consequences.  \n  \nAs of right this moment I'm not convinced that Ray Tracing is more than a gimmick.  In five or ten years it could be the industry standard, but today, in 2021, I just don't think the tech is ready for primetime.  A lot of these games don't present a significant visual improvement over rasterization, but *all* of them have a 20% performance hit.  (I've been reassured repeatedly that my opinion on Ray Tracing is wrong, though, so take what I said with a grain of salt.)  \n  \nDLSS is cool, Ray Tracing will be cool, but if somebody is getting a top of the line RTX GPU in 2021 and expecting it to perform really well in Ray Traced games in 2023, I just think they're going to be disappointed is all.

I'm wondering in these crazy times of graphics cards, if anyone is actually doing waterblocks for these 6800 cards, that can occasionally be purchased, as opposed to the standard reference that have basically never existed in any reasonable numbers (at least here in Australia).\n\nThese cards are faster than the geforce 2080ti and 3070 cards, and can sometimes compete with the 3080, and yet the slower, older 5700xt pulse seem to have plenty of waterblocks available.\n\nI was originally hoping to buy a reference 6800xt, (which would have made the waterblock search easy), but could only find a Pulse 6800 for around the same price. Now 6700XT cards are even more expensive locally than both of their much faster stock siblings, were originally sold for.\n\nIf anyone has found a waterblock for the Sapphire Pulse 6800, would you please let me know?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2846jq14f8q61.jpg?width=706&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f1e32664fc6fd91ba3c587a8a010c2b4c106247",

      "I’m pretty sure Bykski does actually sell a separate block with the A-RX6800-X name, and that it’s not just an illustration of the A-RX6900XT-X block. If you look closely at the photos, they are actually different blocks, so I reckon your seller sent you the wrong product and then tried to claim that it’s all the same thing.\n\nEDIT: Bykski also lists a block by the name of A-SP6800-X for Sapphire 6800 cards, so that one might fit the Pulse if it has a different PCB from reference cards.",
      "I'm still waiting for someone with some inside knowledge.  The pulse 6800 is quite a beast of a card (2500mhz+) and quite energy efficient.  I would love to be able to add it into my custom loop which has plenty of headroom available...",
      "I think I just found the waterblock. The Bykski A-DL6800-X has just been released. It should fit the Sapphire Pulse 6800, Powercolor Fighter 6800, and the Dataland X-serial 6800 model, which all look like they share the same PCB layout.\n\n[BYKSKI A-DL6800-X](https://imgur.com/a/dprkdma)",

      "I can't find any pcb pictures or diagrams of the 6800xt pulse. The pulse 6800 is based on a smaller amd reference board design, also used by powercolor fighter & dataland x series. \n\nThe only thing I can find from techpowerup is the pulse 6800xt has a slightly longer heatsink than the 6800xt nitro. U might need to disassemble it to check if it uses the amd reference or nitro, which should have waterblocks, or another model out there. Make sure you check the vrm clearances for compatibility. The ek site also has some compatibility photos & diagrams which may be useful. \n\nGood luck.",
      "The A-SP6800-X waterblock is for the Nitro 6800. I was told from a Bykski AliExpress store the A-RX6800-X was not actually physically available, it was only listed in online pictures. They provided the A-RX6900XT-X block which will fit all the the standard stock AMD reference parts.\n\nThe Pulse 6800 and Fighter 6800 closely resemble the smaller 6800 AMD reference design that is shown in the diagrams of the A-RX6800-X waterblock\n\n[Smaller Reference RX 6800 PCB - Pulse & Fighter](https://imgur.com/a/e8p8bOT)",

      "Unfortunately, still waiting.  The ali express seller said they would let me know if a compatible block ever became available.  It's a shame amd only produced the 6800 on the larger 6800/6900xt reference design boards and not the smaller reference design pcb sapphire and powercolor utilised. \nIt seems crazy that most of the much slower mid range 5700 series have waterblocks,  but many of the high end 6800 series have nothing available yet...",

The initial A-RX6800-X waterblock design didnt account for the bottom capacitor nearest the pci-e notch that this one seems to overcome with a larger cut out, which I guess its why it was never made.",
      "It fits nicely. U might need to use the included thermal pads along with the grey thermal clay already on the board to properly connect the PCB to the VRM and memory, on the main block and the back plate to ensure you achieve the best results.

I've been trying to get Nvidia's 3070 since it released until I learned of Radeon's new RT 6800 and 6800 XT. \n\nI know that the RTX 3070 is the cheaper option, but the RX6800 is reportedly faster in most aspects. (This will actually be my first GPU so I don't know much about the terms).\n\nSince the latter is coming out tomorrow I'd like to know: \nShould I attempt to buy Radeon's or hope I can nab Nvidia's during another sporadic restock?",

      "There are no benchmarks of amd cards except for the claims of amd.",
      "from my experience it wasn't really playable, I think the game tries to get the missing VRAM from your \"other\", much much much slower ram, and this translates in a ton of spikes.",
      "What resolution are you interested in? Are you interested in ray tracing? If so, from what I've seen, the 3070 actually beats the 6800 XT despite being $150 cheaper in terms of 4K ray tracing. However, if you just care about raw rasterized performance, AMD has more VRAM and is quite good at non-ray tracing fps. The 6800XT is on par with the 3080 in non-4K ray tracing fps, despite having a $50 lower MSRP while also having more VRAM.\n\nI think the 3070 has plenty of VRAM for 1440p, but if you intend to keep it for a long time, then I think it would not be great for 4K. I think the 3080's 10gb is plenty for 4K, but AMD's 6800 and 6800XT have 16gb, which is clearly more. \n\nFinally, not all of these cards are in the same price bracket. However, oversimplified, roughly:\n\n4K, ray-tracing: 3080 \n4K, no ray-tracing: 6800 XT\n1440p, ray-tracing: 3070, 3080 (if you can afford it)\n1440p, no ray-tracing: 6800 XT (if you can afford it), 6800 (budget alternative), 3070 (Not the highest performance, but still a reasonably strong contender given its price)\n\nRather unfortunately, both NVDIA and AMD are having supply issues right now, so purchasing any of these at MSRP is going to be difficult.",
      "idk what led you to believe any or this... the benchmarks show that the 6800xt is either equal or better than the 3080, which itself is significantly better than the 3070. And I have personally tweaked down settings because I was using too much VRAM (8.9Go on mh:world) in 1440p, which means players who play in 4k use much more themselves.",

Please note that, if the wattage requirement of the video card exceeds 90% of your PSU which is 585 watts, you should reduce the power usage of the card to get under the 585 mark, so, that the durability of your power supply is not reduced in the future.\n\nIf you benchmark the video card, the Nvidia RTX 3080 and above and the AMD RX 6800 and above can hit 500 watts during the tests. I'm not sure if you want to risk it, because that will be the moment your computer system might crash.

      "Hey man so I got ex 7800xt and paired with my ryzen 5 5600 its actually really good. I am having crazzy fps on 1080p except in new call of duty and warzone. For some reason my gpu is not at 100% while running extreme settings with native resolution. But overall i am happy with it got it today so will test mode tomorrow but for now i am really happy with the purchase.",
      "Given your current setup and plans, here’s my top choices for performance and value:\n\n1. **RX 6800 XT (Used) f** (Lenovo Legion or Nitro+)\n   *  The RX 6800 XT is a great 1440p GPU, and at 370 EUR, these used options are strong value buys. Both models should give you a substantial performance boost over your RTX 3060, especially in 1440p gaming.\n   *  Used GPUs are a bit riskier, but if these come with a warranty or are from a reputable seller, they can be excellent deals. Just check for clear seller policies on returns or issues.\n2. **RX 7700 XT (New)** \n   *  The RX 7700 XT is newer and generally has better support for modern features like AV1 encoding and lower power consumption. It performs close to the 6800 XT in 1440p and provides a safer, new option without the risk associated with used hardware.\n   *  Performance-wise, the 7700 XT is generally close to the RX 6800 XT but is a bit more expensive than the used 6800 XT options. However, as it’s new, it comes with full warranty support.\n3. **RX 6800 XFX (New)** \n   *  This new option offers a balance of performance and price, without the risk of buying used. It’s a bit below the 6800 XT in raw power but still excellent for 1440p.\n   *  For a similar price, you might get more future-proofing with the RX 7700 XT, though the 6800 XFX is still solid.\n\nThe 7700 XT, being newer, has the advantage of possibly longer driver support. However, for raw 1440p performance, both the RX 6800 XT options will perform similarly.\n\nIf you’re cautious about used GPUs, the new RX 7700 XT or the new RX 6800 might be safer choices. But if you’re comfortable with the used route, the 370 EUR RX 6800 XT options are an incredible value for performance.\n\nIf you’re comfortable with used, go with either the RX 6800 XT Lenovo Legion or Nitro+ at 370 EUR for the best price-to-performance. If you’d rather stick with new hardware, the RX 7700 XT at 444 EUR is a strong choice that will handle 1440p gaming and comes with warranty support.\n\nEither of these will be great at 1440p, especially when paired with your planned Ryzen 5 7600X upgrade.\n\nWell I feel like I have just typed more than I should but I hope you find this helpful. I have tried as much as possible to dig deep into all aspects just to provide a more played out opinion.",
      "They are all the same, more or less. I had the RX6800 16GB for 3 years and the 6800XT for two weeks. Would prefer the RX6800 16GB again and overclock it to 6800XT performance level. The 128MB IF$ is just insainly good for 1440p, although the compute power is on a medium level of ~17 Tflops fp32 for the RX6800. The RX6800 has the best compute/cache ratio of all RDNA2/3 GPUs. 60CU over 128MB, it's 2.13 MB IF$ per CU, the RX6800 swims in bandwidth and is always Compute limited. The IPC per CU is here in greatest form. \nThats the reason why I would go for the RX 6800 for 400€ by now.",

    "selftext": "I built a new system in December 2020. As there was already a problem in getting videocards a bought a 2nd hand 980ti. \n\nNow 2 years later the supply is better, prices are dropping for both used and new cards so it is time to look for an upgrade, especially because I replaced my 51\" HD television for a 4k 55\" (I game on my pc sitting on 180cm distance from the screen) and the 4k resolution  is pushing the 980 to its limits. \n\nInteresting options now are the RTX 3070 8gb for €400  used, or 6800XT 16GB for €475 used in the Netherlands. The 3080 is a lot more expensive. \n\nWhich card is a better choice at the moment, which is a more futureproof choice for the next 4 years?\nMy hesitation of the 3070 is especially the 8gb ram, a relatively small amount for 4k resolution. \n\nAlso, will the prices drop more in the next months/year (new and used)? \n\nThe games I play are mostly 3-5 years old. So in 2026 I play most likely the games released in 2022. \n\nCurrent system: \n\nMainboard: Gigabyte Z490M Gaming X (Z490, socket 1200)\nCPU: Intel Core i5-10400F 2,9GHz (4,3GHz) 6core\nRAM: 2x 8GB PNY XLR8 DDR4 3600MHz\nPSU: MSI MPG A650GF gold rating\nSSD: Crucial 1TB M.2\nGraphics card: Asus Strix GTX 980 TI 6GB",

      "I would choose rx6800 because of the vram",
      "It's also about 25% faster so an easy win for the 6800XT",
      "The 3070 is a 1440p card,  if you want 4k go 6800xt or (preferably) higher",
      "Also don’t forget when going to amd from Nvidia I would run the program ddu to completely remove the nvidia drivers.",
      "For future proofing, I would avoid the Rtx 3070 because it’s vram is only 8GB. I would definitely choose the 6800xt because the 16GB will help in the future.",
      "All right, 6800 XT or higher it is. Hopefully the prices will drop more :)",
      "As a 7900 XT will be eur1200 (MSRP in USD times 1,3), I expect a 7800XT to be around eur1000\n\nThat said, I think eur700 for a 6900XT is a good price, with availability right away instead of waiting another year and the hassle to get one.\n\n(Hopefully I can get one for 700 , as the prices a increasing and dropping each day)",
      "6800 》 3070.",
      "There’s no real future proofing with gpus, but if you want to at least have a good experience without spending crazy amounts of money, it’s better to stay at a mid range and upgrade more often than going with a higher end and trying to use it for a long time:\n\nIll use nvidia as an example.\n\nit’s better to upgrade to a x60/x70 every 1/2 gens, selling the old card while it still has some value so in the end, after the cost of the first card, it feels more like a subscription where you’re only paying the difference between the new card and sale price of the old card every year / couple of years.\n\nNot only you keep a good and constant performance that keeps up with games over the years, you do so without actually spending a crazy amount of money, you also keep up with newer technology.\n\nAlso don’t forget the power cost, people ignore that but at the end of the year, can bit quite a big amount depending on how expensive is electricity there… x60-x70 are the most efficient in power terms, deliver the most frames per watt so keep your power bill in mind.\n\nI mean, a 980ti, while still being slightly more powerful in raw terms than a 3050, it doesn’t have tech like DLSS, meaning it consumes like 2-3x the power while actually performing worse than the 3050 once you enable DLSS. I bet a rtx6070 in a couple gens will be much more desirable than even a 4090 is by then, and with the cost of the 4090 (and the high power bill), you can literally pay the x70 upgrade/sell cycle for many years, way longer than the 4090 realistic lifetime. So even a 4090, unless you need that performance now, wouldn’t be a good future proof GPU, even if it performed well these years, just because of the power consumption.",
      "If you can stretch a 6950 are not crazy to buy compared to a Nvidia line up. The only 2 down sides to amd is their rt is better and drivers can be more stable",
      "That is also a factor that I am considering, but the difference is not that big with our electricity prices.\n\nIn the recent past  is usually bought 2nd hand mid range or high end for € 200 each 3 years. But with 4k that is not a good option. So I need to increase the budget\n\nIn the ATi 8500 and 9800Pro era  I bought those two cards brand-new. But then, a high end card was costing €300 new instead of the 1000+ now.\n\nNew prices now are 649 for a 6800 XT, 699 for a 6900 XT and 1049 for a 6950 XT. Still the 6800 XT and 6900 XT are above my normal budget.",
      "Actual new Prices at the moment \n\n€649 for 6800 XT\n€699 for 6900 XT\n€1049 for 6950XT\n\nSo the the price gap to a 6950 XT is big",
      "Yeh, cards are too expensive nowadays, I haven’t upgraded my old ryzen 1600 and 980ti (i have one too) because of principle, im not going to pay scalper prices, and shops are still selling them at that, rather not play at all even thou the 980ti can still handle games well enough for 1080p (cyberpunk at high settings and fsr in 1080p still runs at 60 fps)\n\nBut I only got the 980ti because i needed the performance back then since i had a oculus rift, but before that i used to upgrade the x70 every gen from the gtx275 to gtx770 and it costed always under the 100€ per gen to do so after selling the old and it kept me playing the latest games at quality settings and the standard resolution of the time and i always had the latest drivers and technologies (shadow play, hairworks, etc).\n\nI skipped the 1070 because made sense downgrading from a 980ti, i waited for the rtx2070 but we know the story there… the gtx1000s where probably the last time we had reasonable prices.",

So a bit more normal, so the prices a dropping and stabilising.\n\n\nBut still deciding if I am willing to pay 700 euros for a brand-new Asus 6900 XT (or 650 for a 6800 XT)",
      "You never, ever ship a gpu to europe, not only they will still kill your deal with vat, you have extra fees for importing and you can also say bye bye to rma if something goes wrong unless you want to pay a lot in shipping.\n\nGpus are stupid expensive here in europe (I haven’t seen a rtx4090 for under 2000€ with the avg price being like 2200-2400€) i bet a 4080 here will cost as much as 4090 in the us, which is annoying as the majority of europeans still have much less purchasing power/expendable income (these high gpu prices are clearly being condoned and promoted by american buyers)",
      "Divide the avg fps by the price, at this point 50€ wont make much of a difference if you’re paying over 700€, but tbh, id check benchmarks, calculate the avg cost per frame of all current gpus and pick the cheapest gpu of the bunch (it will be probably still be one of the mid to mid high tier ones) and that would be my choice and new tier for the upgrade and sell cycle, just add just a bit of offset if you want technologies like ray tracing or not",
      "Yeah vat is a pia, I wish everyone would just use Australia's vat amount.",
      "Indeed 50 euros for 10% more fps, so could be interesting for the rest value or more lifespan on the long run\n\nFact is, that it is more fps and vram per euro in comparing to the nvidia cards, the 3080 is 900 euro here, 3070 ti 750 euro"

Keep in mind the AIB cards will likely beat the 3080 flat out a well.\n\nAMD has also said that at least through the end of the year, so you have a situation where the reference design is $100 cheaper and the AIB boards are $50-100 less for better overall performance in all non RT titles.",

The number of people willing to pay this much are relatively small: for every entheusiast who is buying cards somehow, there are the literally five people who asked me to make a cost effective build that I have flatly told \"not until prices come down\". I'm not upgrading any time soon, and I'm directing people to buy consoles when they ask me how to game right now, something I've never done before in my life.\n\nCompetition, theoretically, will help push prices down - Intel GPUs have to put themselves into some niche in the market, and amd and nvidia will want to respond, so once the market HAS supply then it might act rationally again.",

      "After few years of waiting for an upgrade i've managed to get here. I was casually gaming at 1080p and it was managable but decided it's nice to check 1440p / 144Hz as i was astonished with high refresh rate when seen it in action @ my friends house. That's why i discarded 4k60 from the list.\n\nGrabbed 5600x as there were plenty of them available here in Poland and lucked out with 6800xt with an order @ 15:16 local time at second biggest retailer. Didn't expect i would make it and received info from retailer, that it will be shipped in a month which got me sad. I wanted to cancel and wait for AIB drop next week, but then got a message next day that it's ready to be shipped.\n\nOriginally i wanted to buy 3080 FE but restrained myself until i will see what AMD will release with RDNA2. After reveal the choice was simple but still if i wouldn't get 6800XT, 3080 was my backup plan. I don't care about the brand, just about the performance.\n\nThis system is perfect now, 5600x with PBO boosts up to 4850Mhz if required. It's still a fresh lineup of CPUs so i think next AGESA / BIOS releases will allow for better OC.\n\n6800XT is just a monster for my needs. Some people reported coil whine but mine doesn't have any. Idles @ 50 degrees Celsius and goes up to 80 when gaming.\n\nFull system specs:\n\nR5 5600x  \nASUS TUF X570-Plus  \n16GB 3600 CL16 IRDM Pro GoodRAM kit (Hynix CJR) - still need to play a bit with it  \n6800XT Ref by PowerColor  \n750W Gold PSU  \n\nTo everybody waiting to snag the card / CPU: it's worth it.",

      "Haha, Sandy Bridge is really immortal, i've waited so many years but always had the feeling that it ain't worth it yet. \n\nFor the CPU choice i had the same and as i purely game (without streaming), went with 5600x as i really doubt those 2 extra cores will make a difference. Still at 1440p i will be more GPU limited than CPU.\n\nAnyway, both of them are great choice. 5800x runs a bit hotter form what i see (65W vs 105W TDP) but if you've got a proper cooling, won't be a problem.\n\nI have a friend who bought 5800X and is really happy about it.",

It should serve you well for years to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter getting my stimulus check I decided to finally build a new PC that would replace my PC from 2012 (outside the GPU). It was the PC below:\n\nCPU - i7-3770K @ 4.5 GHz \nRAM - 16GB forgot speed\nGPU - GTX 680 until a 980 ti the day it was released\nPSU - 650 watt\n\nAfter doing my research I learned that the new CPUs and GPUs were right around the corner. Luckily AMD was going to support the current AM4 socket for at least one more CPUs series. So I bought the following to hold me over until the new CPUs and GPUs launched.\n\nCPU - 3800X @ 4.5GHz all cores & IF at 1800 w/NH-D15 stable in games, not in stress testing\nRAM - DDR4 3600\nMB - Gigabyte X570 Aorus Ultra \nGPU - EVGA 2080 Super XC Ultra\nPSU - Corsair 850 watt\nStorage - 1x256Gb (OS) 1x1TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus (games) 6TB of HHDs (2TB & 4TB)\n\nMy plan was to wait until the new GPUs and CPUs dropped and buy the best for VR games. Yesterday I was finally able to buy a 3090 FE (not paying %300+ for the EVGA FTW3 3090) from Best Buy and I will be buying a 5900X as soon as I'm lucky enough to be able to click the \"purchase\" button on a website.\n\nAfter I get my 5900X I will use that computer for at least 5 years and upgrade again. The only thing that would cause me to upgrade before 5 years is if a part comes out that gives me 200% better performance than what I will have now or a game I must play isn't enjoyable because of my current hardware.\n\nI plan on buying a PCI-E 4.0 M.2 drive in the future but for now if I need more storage I will just pickup a large mechanical drive or a large 2.5\" SSD for gaming stuff.\n\nI might buy better RAM since it seems that the memory timings for RAM effect the CPU performance more than the previous Ryzen chips.\n\nSince I play VR mostly I think this rig will allow me to have fun for years to come.\n\nFinal PC Form:\n\nCPU - 5900X with a NH-D15 (OC not known yet since I don't own it yet)\nRAM - DDR4 3600 for now and IF at 1800 (1:1)\nMB - Gigabyte X570 Aorua Ultra\nGPU - 3090 FE\nPSU - Corsair RMX 850\nStorage - 1x256Gb (OS) 1x1TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus (games)",

      "Damn, i felt like 2500k was getting too slow in 2016 and then i upgraded to ryzen 1600x near end of 2017.\n\nI actually didnt expect that big of upgrade in gaming performance due to single thread performance being really about same when both are overclocked, but it was actually big improvement. Having done that i think that sandy bridge owners think improvement is less than you actually get by upgrading.",
      "It's like moving from HDD to SSD in terms of responsivness of the system and overall experience. Its just faster in everything what i do, even causual activities like web browsing seems to be more umm, fluent?\n\nFrom the gaming perspective, there's nothing even to compare now. Zen 3 demolishes my SB very much.",
      "Haha i fully agree. I think the time has come to really abandon old platform and get going with new shiny stuff.\n\nI restrained myself for so many years because Sandy Bridge was still delivering what i needed but i told myself it's time to go and do not look back.\n\nIt was a perfect decision :)",
      "That's a huge jump. I think one zen3 core would almost outrun that whole 2500k. Congrats."

We're in the middle of a VRAM boom and it's only gonna get worse. 8GB will be for 1080P low settings soon. 12GB is considered entry level now by game devs, with 16GB being normal and playing on ultra will require even more. We will likely see this change in the next 1, max 2 years.\n\nThis is why AMD put 20-24GB VRAM on RDNA3. It's also why 4070Ti/4080 owners are getting ripped off even harder than they realize. \n\nFor years game devs gimped their own games to fit into 8GB VRAM, but now that PS4 support died they have collectively decided..  nope. Textures alone will be 12GB or more.",
      "1080P with high details is hardly \"highend\"....",
      "4070Ti vs 7900XT will be a similar scenario in 2 years. Except then we're not talking $500 cards but $800 cards.\n\nNvidia really messed up here. Even if it's intentional to make people upgrade much sooner than the normal 4-5 year upgrade cycle, the backlash will hurt.",
      "and yet this would be a -40 vote comment in 2022 let alone 2020.",
      "Reminder that both the RX 6900XT and 6950Xt cost the SAME price as the 3070 Ti.",
      "Daniel Owen just did a review on 3070 ti vs 6950xt as they are priced the same (in fact the 6950xt is cheaper on average) and showed how, for the money, the 6950xt destroys the 3070ti, even beating it in many games with RT enabled.\n\nHe is also a very pleasant youtuber.",
      "NVIDIA Can do whatever they want because most gamers want their cards over any brand. Sadly.",
      "exactly, had a chuckle when the nvidia GPU still stutters with DLSS On.....",
      "It’s great that AMD is forcing the VRAM competition even if they couldn’t compete on the top-end. At least NVIDIA is being forced to lower their price or increase VRAM on the mid to low end.",
      "If you google it you'll find reddit threads from 1-2 years ago laughing about this topic and saying 8GB is fine and AMD is dumb for putting so much VRAM on their cards, that it's just a \"trick\" to sell their GPUs because they suck.\n\nThat's what Nvidia gamers were thinking. And keep in mind the ones on Reddit tend to represent the more knowledgeable portion of gamers..",
      "To be fair, DLSS doesnt do that much for VRAM usage.\n\nDigital Foundry on this topic:\n\n[https://youtu.be/hkBTOUOqUCU?t=4278](https://youtu.be/hkBTOUOqUCU?t=4278)",

      "This (vram) was a rising issue, 8gb don't cut it it's just people slow to catch up and pull their heads out of Nvidia's ass.\n\nAlso the 6800 nonxt seems like the golden goose of last generation of GPUs, enough horsepower to match or beat the RTX 3070Ti, 16GB vram, decent ray tracing and almost same or lower price than RTX 3070.",
      "I was debating between a 4070Ti or 7900XT, but this has definitely swayed me to the AMD GPU with its 20GB VRAM. I feel even 12GB is cutting it a bit fine these days.",

      "The fact that some games run normally on 8GB GPUs, but look like shit, even tho settings are set to \"high\" and \"ultra\" is really problematic. In the past you at least got low FPS and would scale down settings as a result, here you don't even get consistant settings, it is all over the place. I guess game developers prefer angry posts about poor image quality over angry posts about poor performance.",
      "That's actually their goal, they want to be an AI company in the not so distant future.\n\nIntel's total worth: $135 billion\n\nAMD's total worth: $148 billion\n\nNvidia's total worth: an eye watering $662 billion. More than double the worth of AMD and Intel combined. Despite having a lower annual revenue than both.\n\nAnd this has very little to do with their consumer gaming cards. They could stop production of all Geforce GPUs, focus entirely on their professional cards and still make bank. Especially with the razor thin margins on RTX4000 cards. Smart people have invested in Nvidia because of AI. \n\nAlthough, if you had invested in AMD in Q3-4 2022, you would have doubled your money by now too..  crazy swings, almost like crypto.",
      "And yet only 20% of steam users (from the latest survey) had more than 8GB of VRAM.  Either the devs are out of touch or they just want to cater to the high end."

The whole “unifan” design where you can chain them is game changing when it comes to cable managing. The back of my case looks more neat. They are easy to set up (6 wires in total for all the fans) and the diffused lightning look is great. The QLs I feel like has too many LEDs and can be too bright, along with having to cable manage 16+ wires and invest in the corsair ecosystem",
      "If the 6900 XT had this variant then it'll be slightly more desirable. I had a 3070 Founders Edition and it was hard to let go",
      "MSI's version to do the same is 200MB+.",

      "LOL I went from a 360mm rad to this, wanted to try something new. It's HUGE",

I went from a reference Vega 56 that I bought for 160€ right before the GPU craze, to selling it for 420€ during it and buying a new reference 6800 for 900€.\n\nThe difference in performance but also noise was incredible. Then I managed to sell my 1.5yrs old reference 6800 for 515€ and bought a 3 months old MSI Gaming X Trios for 420€.\n\nI run this thing at 2300-2400MHz with an insane 880mV, it's so quiet, even compared to the reference model, which I actually liked more design-wise. Really happy about the decision, though. These GPU's are crazy price to performance wise, especially in my market, where Nvidia is still overpriced. Wouldn't want to support them anyway, though.",

I'm hoping for price cuts across all their product ranges to remain competitive.",

      "Note, it's only 14% faster if you take those games out.\n\nI agree with you that AMD are being excessively greedy with pricing for the Radeon GPUs here. I can understand it with Ryzen, they've established themselves in that market, they are providing industry leading performance, they should charge a premium.\n\nBut with Radeon? Charging a 15-20% premium over the competition, with a worse software stack and worse features all around, for a 10-14% performance uplift is unacceptable. They need to aggressively take the market from Nvidia the same way they did from Intel with Ryzen back in 2018. RDNA2 is in many ways comparable to Zen+ and Zen+ was, and even still is, insanely good value for the performance you get out of it.",
      "I really really wish u/HardwareUnboxed would be more careful when arguing against the 8GB VRAM of the RTX 3070. They said:\n\n>and we've already got a number of examples where the RTX 3070 is hamstrung by its 8GB VRAM buffer: Doom Eternal using the ultra nightmare preset is one example, Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing enabled is another and there would be more to come surely (shortly?)\n\nWhy is the RT performance in Cyberpunk 2077 mentioned here? With RT enabled the RX 6800 would be almost unplayable. So how come this is mentioned as a shortcoming of the RTX 3070 versus the RX 6800?",

For $50 more you get equivalent rasterization, way better raytracing, and better features in the 3080. $600 would be a very compelling pricepoint and if the 6800XT were $600 I probably would have gotten it. Instead, I felt like the 3070 was the better pick for me (especially because I was able to find one).",
      "Where I am, the 6800 is $150usd more expensive than the 3070 cards and it's only $30usd away from the RTX3080.\n\nSo I don't know, maybe the 6800 vs 3070 makese sense in HUB land but where I am the 6800's competitor is actually the RTX3080. 3070 vs 6800 doesn't make sense for me personally because the 6800 is 10% faster but 30% more expensive",
      "Neither card is future proof and the VRAM won't change that.",

      "There is more to that recommendation than is perceived by most.\nIf they are smaller than 14 gauge cables then it is recommended to run individual cables. It actually has nothing to do with the amount of power running through the cables but the resistance of the wire itself. Wire degrades throughput by resistance to amperage requiring more voltage to move the amperage. This is why quality power supplies output 12.3v-12.5v on the 12v power wires. 14 gauge can handle about 28 amps before going below the 3% voltage drop required for critical or sensitive components.\n\nExample at under 2 feet for 14 gauge wire \n12v*25 amps is 300w total\nVoltage drop of 0.31 or 2.59%\nSo only 11.69V*25 amps or 292watts is actually making it to the end of the wire (graphics card). Shorter distance or bigger wire is the only way to lessen the problem.\n\n12v*28 amps is 336w total\nVoltage drop is .35v or 2.9%\nSo 11.65v*28 amps or 326w is actually making it to the end of the wire (graphics card).\n\nTo fully understand the issue look at a marine wire chart for amperage by gauge for critical components and a voltage drop calculator.\n\nhttps://www.bluesea.com/resources/1437\n\nhttps://www.inchcalculator.com/voltage-drop-calculator/"

The DRP4 doesn't have the clips stick out which means I need a flathead or knife to take it off.",

I actually went with an air cooler so that i don't have to tinker with it anymore and it has almost no point of failure in the future beside the fans and they can be replaced easily. big ones like this and the Noctua competitor run extremely quiet. i sent mine to max 60% fan speed and I get amazing temps.",

      "AMD confirmed that more reference cards will be made for all models. But given that at most AMD is only getting at most 60 GPUs per wafer and Nvidia is getting at most 50 GPUs per wafer for both companies largest dies, don't expect supply to normalize any time soon. Keep in mind that that's only 140,000 TSMC 7nm wafers processed every month in total. And AMD has between 44,000 and 70,000 of those (we know that no customer is over 50% and some customers have dropped without disclosing who the allocation went to). Nvidia is using Samsung 8nm and we aren't sure how many wafers they're buying or even how many wafers per month Samsung is making on 8nm versus their 7nm process. But total supply to Nvidia is likely between 100-300% of what AMD is using at TSMC for GPUs based on what numbers look like in wholesale channels.\n\nMy guess is that Nvidia probably has around 10k-15K wafers/mo for all of its Ampere products including the A100 which is currently out of stock with earliest possible delivery via air being listed as 3 weeks. And AMD is likely only dedicating 2-3K wafers/mo to their high-end GPUs with the vast majority of their TSMC 7nm wafer allotment being slotted for console APUs, processors, and low- and mid-range GPUs that are launching next year. Furthermore, AMD also is starting to fulfill CDNA which is a 120 CU  computer focused GPGPU solution for data centers which features better FP16, FP32, and FP64 performance compared to Nvidia's A100 and has already been ordered in bulk, along with the not yet publicly released new Epyc processors for the first two exascale supercomputers.\n\nOh, and to top this all off, we've had shortages of the following so far this year:\n\n* Screws\n\n* Shipping containers from China\n\n* Shipping containers to China\n\n* Air freight capacity due to decreased intercontinental flights and now vaccine deployment\n\nAnd all of that is affecting the ability to move produced products from Asia to the rest of the world.

Wouldn't be a hard decision for me to go for the 4080 if I was deciding between the two.\n\nAMD is delusional with their pricing this gen or maybe they just don't care and know they won't sell much at their current prices and are ok with it as long as the profit margins are high.\n\nNvidia is also delusional with their pricing this gen but at least they have a good line of cards and people justify paying more for the better features.",

      "the really ugly one is going to be 7700, where you're using almost as much N6 wafer area as a 7600 and then adding 200mm2 of N5P.  The MCM area overhead is atrocious.\n\nSo basically take a 7600 and then add three Zen4 chiplets worth of area, to slide performance upwards from 4060 to 4060 Ti performance.  Which it should edge past pretty easily ofc (4060 ti + 5-10%?) but it's gonna be a godawful deal for AMD.  Like I guess if it's 10% faster than 4060 Ti 8GB they do $429?  What an absolute waste of silicon from their perspective.  \n\nThere literally is not a number where that product is worthwhile - even at $499 it would be a waste of silicon for AMD compared to Zen chiplets.  And 7800 really needed to be sold for at least $600.  But the product performance just can't justify that.  This is Vega 2.0 where AMD is getting pinched by how poorly their silicon is performing relative to the established performance levels of the competition, and even AMD can't pretend it's an awesome deal at MSRP, but neither can they afford to go any lower on pricing.\n\nThat was when we saw the bundle deals (\"buy a GPU for $100 more than MSRP and get a coupon for $100 off a specific monitor nobody wants absolutely free, coupon expires in 30 days!\") and other crap kick in to shift ASPs upwards.  And even still, standalone MSRP was so low that partners couldn't actually make a profit on the cards they were ordering from AMD (\"made by AMD\" reference cards).  Everyone got real mad about that with NVIDIA a year ago, I think everyone forgot that was an AMD thing with Vega too lmao.\n\nI think the numbers have to be $499 for 7800 and $399 for 7700, *maybe* they will try for $529/$429 to squeeze a couple more bucks but at $450/$550 they are DOA.  DLSS alone is worth 10% to me.",

So yeah the 4GB of VRAM extra is nice, but the RT performance, DLSS and other features like NVIDIA Broadcast and just general driver stability or rendering performance keep the RTX 4070 lingering around as an option. The $100 pricing gap between the 7800 XT and the 4070 in the USA is basically not really a thing here.\n\nThe 7800 XT desperately needs a price drop here in Australia to be a relevant purchase. A good $80 AUD price drop puts the 7800 XT into a spot of consideration. But then I remember that a used 6800 XT goes for around $650 AUD, so unless you really use RT or want AV1 can't see a reason to buy a 7800 XT.\n\nAnother AMD graphics card release, another dead on arrival product here in Australia.",

      "Hubs video too. No significant change in performance. Thanks amd for blessing us with this massive W today. Same performance as last gens card something I have not seen on either nvidia or amds side in so long but hey. It's just $15 more expensive than last gens card so that's good ? Maybe...?

Also an important point is that 6800xt performance uplift via drivers is likely not going to happen anymore but 7800xt is likely going to get quite a few driver updates that improve performance. \n\nPlus I have seen reviews from 3 different sources running sometimes the same games and where Steve was getting better performance on the 6800xt the other two were getting equal or better performance on 7800xt. \n\nImportant thing to note, Steve was running the stock version of 7800xt vs sapphire nitro+ version of 6800xt. Jayztwocents was running the same version of two cards(red devil powercolor) and 7800xt was showing better results vs 6800xt. \n\nAnd I was hoping for exactly this, similar performance for less power draw and same price or cheaper. And it is in UK same price or cheaper.",

      "Great, so when can I buy one for MSRP?",
      "Yeah that's my point, the games list is different. Anno 1800 has been dropped for example and Assassin's Creed Odyssey has been replaced by Valhalla which is a big win for AMD and they've added Cyberpunk 2077. They've dropped Project Cars 3 which was a really bad title for AMD.\n\nThen other changes include the addition of Watch Dogs Legion, the upgrade to Hitman 3 from 2, and the removal of Star Wars Jedi in favour of Squadrons. So a good number of changes there that completely invalidates the comparison.",
      "How much are we talking here?",
      "Faulty reporting.  It hasnt \"increased\".   They tested different games, a bunch of them AMD partenered ones - Dirt 5, Valhalla, Resident Evil Village which place the AMD cards ahead. And many outlets dont retest older cards that might benefit from driver and patch uplifts.  So the newer released cards get benchmarked with newer drivers and patched games while results for 3080 and 3090 are showed from last year.",
      "Maybe its worth doing another fine wine investigation",
      "True, but it also depends on what titles you're comparing. As well as what graphics settings you're using.\n\nMSAA in use? AMD's probably winning due to the incredible pixel fillrate of 128 ROPs combined with 128MB of cache.\n\nSuper-heavy volumetric effects? Nvidia's probably going to win due to the big FLOPS advantage.\n\nAs for FineWine, it's probably going to be less of a thing with RDNA and RDNA2. The strength of RDNA2 is that the chips seems to be very well balanced and utilized, which wasn't the case at all for GCN. Even at GCN's launch, AMD needed more execution units to match Nvidia. Going back 9 years, AMD's gone from 2048 ALUs with the 7970, to 5120 ALUs with the 6900 XT.\n\nAmpere on the other hand, is a lot less balanced than previous Nvidia generations. It even exhibits similarities with GCN where higher gaming resolutions perform noticeably better when compared against previous generations. Going back 9 years, Nvidia's gone from 1536 ALUs with the 680, to 10496 with the 3090.",
      "20-25% so it is like jumping up 1.5 tiers to something between a 2080 super and 2080 ti and your card sits a little below a 2070 super. If you look at ebay sold listings prices, you can potentially get another $100 cash during the trade too.\n\n\nYour current card is a solid 1440p card at high settings so even if you sit on it and not trade up, you at least won't be struggling for playable framerates and settings (unlike my gtx 980 that is struggling at 1080p medium settings on a 1440p144hz monitor).\n\n\nI feel you about the prices. A $1200 rtx 2080 ti equivalent should be $500 right now. Gaming is a hobby and paying 2-4x more than a console for a single part is one thing but paying up to 3x the MSRP of a card is insane even if I can drop $3k on a 3090 without any financial strain.",

Both cards will be great.\n\nRyzen 5000 release on thursday might be a good indication about possible supply issues on AMDs side, even though CPUs are a bit different i believe.",
      "I'm wondering if Nvidia's supply bottle neck on the 3080 is Samsung making the GPU or micron making the gddr6x.  If we see 3070 (which uses normal gddr6) availability normalize faster than the 3080 it would make me suspect the gddr6x is what's holding back the 3080.",
      "i would say samsung. there have been a lot and long rumors about problems with samsung 8nm. dont forget 3070 isnt the same die as 3080 and 3090. 3070 is smaller and easier to make. \n\nsoon after 3080 launch there was a picture either from chip manufacturing lab or card manufacturing lab, of a 3080 cards or chips in testing. failure rate because of cooling was over 30% i think. that means at least 30% of tested chips didnt qualify as 3080 because they need too much power and cant be cooled properly if chips are running at advertised 3080 frequencies.\n\non other hand, the gddr6x maker had basically 0 rumors about problems with its manufacturing, and as other pointed out in older topics, they were making quite many very high speed ram chips, that would indicate their manufacturing process is in good shape. i know, its not quite the same because gddr6x isnt a industry standard but something memory company and nvidia made together for nvidia, and it doesnt automatically make gddr6x production yield quality as the ram chips they are making. \n\nbut from all the rumors floating around, i would say samsung is the issue, kinda. because there is also a rumor than nvidia is buying limited amount of big chips until samsung improves yields. i am not sure how this works and why nvidia would have to pay for defected chips and not just good ones, but thats the rumor.\n\nanother bad sign for samsung as culprit is that Ampere architecture, similar as Turing, has one of the worst performance jumps in generation in nvidias history. and it is with a node jump, from Turing at TSMC 12nm to Ampere at samsung 8nm. since Ampere launch, many are saying that samsung 8nm is not a a big jump for silicon from TSMC 12nm. \n\nfor full truth we will probably have to wait a few months though"

In recent times I have owned an RX 3070 (positive feelings as well) and an RX 6600 XT, which gave me some headaches because of ReBar Z390 compatibility issues, I'll admit, but I managed to get the best of it in the end. \n\nPositives for you with this card or rather a negative experience?\n\n\\*Since 2002 I have owned 8 GPU's (4 Nvidia and 4 ATI/AMD), so non-partisan consumer here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

      "Went from a r9 390 to a 1080ti to sapphire pulse rx 6800, all great cards honestly.\n\n\nNever had a problem with either brands.",
      "What hate ? Doesn't most of Reddit recommend the rx6700 and rx6800xt as the gpu to get ?\n\nPeople go for nvidia because it's either all they ever know or they really need ray tracing, upscalers and CUDA. Personally I can't stand upscalers(only game at 4k native) and the games I play either don't have ray tracing or it's an half assed attempt of it's implementation that changes very little, so radeon was the only logical option.",
      "This is a bit of a ramble that doesn’t really have much to do with the RX 6800 and more to do with AMD cards overall, but I guess this all comes down to that user’s personal experience. For the most part I’ve only owned ATI and AMD GPUs, integrated and discrete. I’ve had the odd Intel iGPU (and a couple of Arc cards) and the odd Nvidia GPU, but by and large, I have a love/hate relationship with AMD given my varying experiences of their cards. \n\nLargely, you can boil down a lot of peoples’ frustrations to drivers, power consumption and/or performance in a given scenario. Bad drivers are something I experienced first-hand on my R9 Fury X, which didn’t work on the Adrenalin 2020 drivers until the August 2020 drivers - and it took the final legacy driver patch in June 2022 to make official post-2019 drivers usable on it. I know drivers have burned a few people that I’ve talked to (predominately those with cards that AMD has neglected on Windows, like the discrete Fiji and Vega cards), but at the end of the day, your mileage may vary. \n\nAnd that’s what it boils down to: what does your setup and use case play nicer with? I had an RTX 3060 and while it was a performance uplift from my Fury X, I felt massively disappointed by it and decided to go back to AMD to get a 7900 XT. Outside of instability from my card’s high boost clock that I’ve had to fiddle with (2850MHz), I’ve been massively satisfied by it - and I don’t think I could’ve said the same about an RTX 4070 Ti for myself. This could very well go vice versa, too - I have a 4K monitor, which really leans into what the 7900 XT does best, but if I was gunning for HFR 1440p gaming, I could’ve lived with the 4070 Ti easily.",
      "A lot of people still dont buy AMD because the hate of the years ago are still somewhat in their brain.",
      "I went from R7 370 to 1660 Super to 6800xt.\n\nNo problems here either.",
      "I've had many cards from both companies. My experience was similar on both sided with pros/cons and minor issues at times.\n\nI love AMD for it's superior gpu software and interface (for my needs), but I like Nvidia for DLSS and better ray tracing (I don't use it much, but it's nice to know it's there when I do).\n\nI'll buy whatever feels like the best deal at the time, but I have a bit of a soft spot for AMD due to them making adaptive sync affordable.",
      "I ran Nvidia since 2008 till this year, it's the only GPU and software for that GPU that I really knew. It was a leap of faith that my RX 6750XT wouldn't mess up for fail me on what can honestly be a varied selection of games I play. Maybe there would be crashes or driver errors or whatever and maybe it was worth the $50 more to just get a 4060Ti and play it safe. \n\nIt has been the most boring fucking transition ever. I set it up and forgot about it as it just runs flawlessly if not better than my Nvidia card as I didn't have to scrub through emails to remember my login for geforce experience this time.",
      "The only thing I know that I'm missing is better RT. Some games it be nice to have a better playable RT experience. With my 6900XT, I generally just leave it off. Even with FSR2, the fluctuations are too extreme even when it seems playable. 80/90fps one second down to 35/45fps the next second. \n\nThe only upside is RT ATM overall seems meh. Not very noticable to me in SpiderMan or Fortnite and Hogwarts is so rough around the edges it isn't worth having on. \n\nGames I want to have RT, like Stray or DRG, don't sadly. \n\nThough it seems like RT on RDNA3 is greatly improved. \n\nOtherwise I'm happy with my pick. Maybe if I go Nvidia I'll notice more of what I am missing. I had upgraded from a GeForce 1660S. But at the end of the day I am still mostly focus on the most raster performance I can get for my money. When I got my 6900XT it was during the crypto boom so comparable Nvidia was like 600-800 dollars more at the time.",
      "I swore I would never buy a ATi/AMD card ever again after several bad experiences in the past. But the Covid shit show forced me into buying a RX 6800 XT. And it's been a great overall experience. No driver issues, great performance and the software experience with adrenaline is much better than what team green is offering. And considering how Nvidia is pricing their stuff now I think I will be sticking with AMD for the foreseeable future.",
      "Reddit loves AMD cards tho. So do all my YT suggestions i get.\n\nBuilt a new PC recently, 6800XT was the most suggested card everywhere in the price range i was looking.\n\nI decided to go with the 4070 in the end, but i really like that we have options to chose from. \n\nPower consumption plus more expensive PSU are not always counted in the comparisions tho. That was the deciding factor for me.",
      "Not as if nvidia were not just as hated (if not more) at different times.  \n\n\nI guess for a lot of people it might be the attitude around when they go their first machine.  \n\n\nMaybe I go more AMD since ATI was my third \"3d\" card, voodoo 1 add on being the first, but then again I have been nvidia a lot too. Hey my current laptop is (not that it gets used as much!).",
      "A lot of them hating on it have probably never tried DLSS themselves tbh",
      ">are we dealing with an irrational consumer\n\nNo. Most consumers like DLSS, Reflex etc and it is usually worth the extra $50-$100 over the AMD alternative. Most people also buy prebuilts, which almost never feature AMD cards.",
      "The problems people have with AMD are the fact they aren’t much cheaper than the Nvidia alternative and are lacking features. DLSS is sorely missed on AMD and they don’t even have an answer for framegen so going forward they are going to have some competition problems.\n\nThey aren’t bad cards, but there are some frustrating things. Issues with DXVK on older games, people having issues with VRR, Dolby Atmos issues, etc.",
      "The reddit cloud loves and hates on them. The reality is Nvidia has the mind share so the world outside of reddit really doesn't care. They buy Nvidia, it works, they move on. Without something to generate a lot of buzz, AMD feeds their niche in the GPU department and tries to claw back any ground they lost over the last decade. Last I read steam surveys had them at 8% market share and combined with other sources a high estimate of 12% is possible. \n\nI personally love the reddit AMD crowd. They're over zealous sometimes but hopefully Intels next GPU round does better and we get more people realizing there are alternatives. Nvidia sitting pretty at 90% market share and legions of investors isn't good for anyone in the consumer segment. We need all the viable options we can get.",
      "Nvidia is really driving the GPU industry with a huge investment in R&D, that's why. CUDA, Optix, RT cores, Tensor cores, DLSS, DLSS-FG for example.\n\nAMD is always responding, ROCm, HIP-RT, RT cores, WMMA instruction, FSR 1/2, FSR3, so while their raw raster performance is certainly up to snuff they're typically at least a generation behind on all the other bits.\n\nMost *gamers* don't care that much beyond raw raster performance so that's why AMD is such a good option in that space.",
      "Same, I've had an RX 480 and now an RX 6950...   Nothing but good experiences outside of Windows Update causing driver issues with Adrenaline Software...   But that's because Microsoft removed the option to disable automatic driver updates in the Windows Updater...\n\nDriver stability and issues are slightly better than my experience with Nvidia over the same period.",
      "sis kid had a 6800 soon 3 years, he is happy and me with a 6700xt runs stuff perfectly.\n\nvery few writes on social medias usually so ignore them works",
      "Funny enough you can not even use RT in any lower end Nvidia GPU because u run out of vram and they end up losing to AMD in many RT scenarios.\n\nYeah the freesync was amazing for AMD to open that up.\n\nAMD has done a scummy thing on Freesync is that they make freesync over HDMI (not the vesa standard in 2.0 and above) an AMD only thing and refuse to open it up.",

      "That’s crazy… here in the middle of Europe the cheapest 6800XT sits at 700€ (incl. VAT). For 970€ you‘d get a 7900XT…\n\nYou can basically decide between spending a lot and overpaying for the newest gen or spending less but still overpaying for an older gen.\n\nLast week a friend asked for advice for upgrading from an GTX 1080 with a budget of 700€ and the only thing I could tell him was „raise your budget or stay put for the time being“.",
      "Ha, I did a very similar upgrade...had a 2600x and 1080ti, bought a 3440x1440 ultrawide and couldn't drive it properly so thought...time for an upgrade. Bought a 5600x and then 6800xt (Red Devil) and am so impressed with the improvement. 6800xt is a beast.",
      "I also have a 3700x but for someone who also values some workloads, would the 5800x3d hurt me there? I been using my 3700x at 4.4 ghz stable for almost 4 yrs but was thinking to upgrade to 5700x. However, I heard it's not much difference if I did upgrade to 5700x. \n\nWhile thinking about the 5800x3d, I understand that it's better for gaming. I just worry about the workload on editing and basic things.",
      "How's 6800xt handling 2k ultrawide? How often do you hit 100fps+, or is it just hovering around 60? I was considering this GPU as i have the same specs for the screen, but i was worried a bit about future proofing.",
      "Pretty sure you would see a pretty massive improvement in any single or multithreaded workload over a 3 series. Clock speed isn’t everything, the architecture, cache etc are all going to contribute to performance. Not to mention if you plan on keeping this system for years why not just slot in the best processor you can get for the motherboard you already have, it could let you get another 5 years out of the system you already have. If you see one at the right price I say go for it.",
      "You could make a new account, Aliexpress style, but you know, depends on how much you care about contributing to the profit margins of Micro Center. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like Micro Center and wish to contribute to its continued success so I personally wouldn't do it, but individuals must make his own decision.",
      "6800xt user here, by 2k ultrawide did you mean 3440 by 1440? If so thats what i use, and for example in Modern Warfare both in the multiplayer and Warzone it sits above 100 fps comfortably at Ultra settings with 110 fov. \n\nI do use FSR cause i have a 144hz monitor so i want to get closer to that number, but i think even without that i think the framerate would still be good.\n\nIf you want to i could run a benchmark for you if i have the game!\n\nEdit: FSR is at Quality i believe",
      "Thanks!  Aside from a few small hiccups, I've been blown away by the 6800XT's gaming performance.  It's over twice as powerful as my 1080 was, and going by what limited ultrawide benchmarks I could find, I'm in 6900XT territory with a decent undervolt and overclock.\n\nAnd yes, I love this case as well.  Upgraded to it when I upgraded to Ryzen back in 2020.  The netting and dust guards have been invaluable as my computer sits in a room that loves to gather dust, and the cable management features are great.",
      "Yep, I've been really impressed with the performance increase.  I was looking at both the Red Devil and the XFX Merc as upgrade options, but the XFX card had the best deal going when I snagged it on Amazon.  Funnily enough, the last four AMD cards I've owned have all been from XFX, and they all worked great for me.  I think I've managed a pretty solid overclock on my 6800xt as well.  It's currently sitting at 2500-2600 core, 1035mv and averages 2560 in most games.  Memory is at 2150 (2140 actual) and fast timings, and power is maxed at 295W.  I've tried More Power Tool and upping the power limit, but I think my card is maxed.  Throwing more watts at it ups the heat but not performance.  How's the Red Devil been treating you?",
      "I’m on a 1080 but at 4K. If I was 1440p the 6800xt would have been perfect and I see them around 520-550 bucks. Decided to step up to an XTX which will be here in March. Can’t go wrong with the 6800XT if you’re in less than 4k, and even at 4K it’s still double or more than the 1080."

The power consumption in Time Spy is  around 285W, the card constantly boosts to 2500 and my graphics score is well above 21,000 while my hot spot temp is below 95c (reference card).

These Radeon cards have a high TDP but for what ever reason doesn't fully hit the power limit yet the stock voltage really heats up the card and can cause it to thermal throttle. So it's basically a balancing act between the 2. This is a very weak explanation,  videos on YouTube explain it much better. \n\nOh and tweak the fan curve too, the overall card Temps aren't bad but as u see on the software the junction temp on the card can get over 100, so tweak the undervolt and fan curve accordingly.",

I suspect UPS is almost as good as USPS because their employees actually give a fk about their jobs due to like USPS having a living wage and benefits due to a strong labor union.  FedEx and Ontrac are the worst with employees that for good reason don't give a fk.\n\n\n^(edit:)\n\n^(Ofc... for a hefty fee FedEx has a high security option where they will guarantee packages aren't lost or stolen during transit.)",

If it isn't retail employees cancelling your orders and selling your stuff to others, or warehouse workers disappearing entire pallets of goodies, it's drivers getting wise and running off with packages.\n\nWhat a garbage year for building a PC.",

    "comments": [
      "The 6800xt is over 200€ cheaper than the 3080 in Germany. Prise wise the 6950xt is about the same as the 3080. How do these two compare?",
      "Nvidia 30 series has always been faster at higher resolutions relative to AMD 6000 series, probably because the two architectures simply behave differently. The vram mostly doesn't play a role because apparently 10gb is still enough, but in the 3070 vs 6800 video you can clearly see how much the 3070 struggles. The issue is certainly overblown, some people think the 3070 is now useless when in reality it's just a matter of adjusting a few settings and it can still play very well, but the real problem is Nvidia putting only 8gb of vram on a GPU of that performance class. In the long run it's going to severely impact the longevity of the card.",
      "See the interesting thing is that at 4k (where vram matters most) the margin widens in favor of the 3080. Also interesting to note is HU reported that in hogwars legacy the 3080 ran out of vram but the 6800xt didn't provide a playable experience either. Maybe, just maybe, the vram issue is a bit overblown? For the most part, the lack of vram is not what's holding these gpus back",
      "6950XT is basically a 3090 level of performance. That's a no-brainer, Radeon wins.\n\nAnd the 6800XT is an even better deal.",
      "I was expecting to see this sub complain about HUB using so many RT titles, therefore swaying the % differences in favor of the 3080. Glad to see that’s not the case, at least not yet. In reality, anyone who bought a 3080, like myself, was interested in RT, so it definitely matters between these 2 GPUs, but I have to admit I was hoping to buy a 6800xt until a 3080 kinda fell into my lap during the height of the pandemic for close to MSRP.",
      "The \"vram\" issue is only about the fact that in 2023 you should not buy cards with low vram and expect not to encounter issues in 2024 in various ports or AAA titles coming out.         \nCards will work, you will be still able to play simply low vram have huge chance to impact quality of graphics you can use. \n\n\"Developers should optimize their games\" ... yes they should, but they will not do it as this require time and time means cost so something investors don't like.          \nLets be honest new titles will become more vram hungry and everything below 16GB at this point will need to be replaced somewhere in 2024.    \n\nFact that we get \"new\" cards in 2023 that have less than 16GB ram and cost >300$ is pretty much planned way to force users to buy new cards \"soon\".\n\nUnless like me you play in stellaris ... and stuff like Serf City.",
      "> Maybe, just maybe, the vram issue is a bit overblown?\n\nI think it's mostly misinterpreted. \n\nIf you have a 3070 8GB or especially 3080 10GB you should happily keep using it until either performance or outright VRAM limitations keep you from playing games at acceptable settings. You'll likely be able to use that card even at 1440p with minimal sacrifices for a while to come and enjoy a smooth gaming experience overall even in recent and near future titles.\n\nWhat the 3070 vs 6800 video did highlight was that we are approaching a threshold where VRAM capacity in the order of 8 (or 10 for that matter) GB is becoming a reasonable limitation in performance especially in the near future, bottlenecking otherwise excellent performance. Nvidia is still releasing 12GB GPUs at a $600 price point and even at $800 with the 4070ti (cheapest pc part picker prices). When buying new at that price point, it's not a bad concern to have if (like me) you like to milk a GPU until the end.\n\nI've had VRAM run out well before performance did in the past with a 780ti, it's a waste.\n\nThe 3070 and 3080 are still great cards, but the VRAM limitation should be a consideration to those buying new, especially since 16GB AMD cards are so comparatively cheap.",
      "same in Croatia, that's why i bought 6800xt and will sell 3070 while i can get some decent money for it.",
      "I'm just here for the comments :)",
      "I picked the 6800XT over the 3080 and they were at the same price. No way Im buying a 10GB GPU in 2023.",
      "Peformance class\nPrice class",
      "As a 6800XT owner there is nothing wrong with using RT on. It’s a very relevant tech now compared to launch, and in basically any game that has RT except for Cyberpunk I turn RT on. I still get playable frame rates so I figure why not use it (Dead Space, Callisto Protocol, Doom Eternal, Control, all ran well enough with RT) but the fact is I’d be getting much better performance with a 3080 at those settings.",
      "I upgraded from an RX 480 to an RTX 3080 back in 2020 and was able to get my card for around MSRP.\n\n\nFor me it came down to \"bad RT performance and no DLSS forever\" vs \"potential VRAM issues between now and 2024\". I rolled the dice and went for the new tech over the VRAM and so far it's been fine. I think TLOU's horrible PC port is the only game where you can't reasonably tune around the memory usage (not that there are many games where it's even an issue). Is it a sign of things to come? Really too early to say. Cyberpunk with full on pathtracing uses less VRAM than TLOU and Hogwarts.",

To be honest I can't say Ive ever seen so many people posting \"Ive always had Nvidia but theyve overvalued their cards\" or something similar lately.\n\nBeen loving the card, and can't stress enough to anyone on the fence that the 6800xt and 6950xt are totally worth looking at with current pricing. The only reason I didn't go with the 6950xt was I would also need a new psu and I just didn't want to do it as of yet.\n\nAlso, nvidia could learn from Adrenaline, control panel has looked and functioned the same since windows 98, needs updated.",
      "Yeah this makes sense. If we start approaching the point where vram is the main limitation, then ofc nvidia is messing by not increasing the vram of their chips. \n\nBut more specific to this video, so far the 3080 has aged better than the 6800xt, in direct contradiction to what a lot of people said back when both chips released",
      "6800xt is way better than 3070",
      "I still believe at the time the 3080 was and is a better card for near the same price. People on here overblow the Vram issue by a mile. More Vram for a 1440p card is not worth the crappy encoder (RIP Quest Users), no DLSS, dogshit UE4 VR performance and no Ai broadcasting at all. The 6800XT is still an amazing card and with it being $200 cheaper in some places it is the better card today but when both were around $700 idk why anyone would give up all those features so that one random Vram heavy game might work better tbh. The 3080s also have a much higher resell value compared to the 6800XT. People are selling 3080 used for $500+ rn.",

      "I was thinking about that since the shrinkwrap looks terrible. But two 8-pin PCI-E connectors is about $60 from Corsair...",

      "Indeed, welcome to the family.",
      "Yes, there is a technical reason. I don’t know the specifics of the technicals, but I do know that using two separate cables will provide more consistent clean power to the GPU.\n\nUsing that setup, take for example the +5v pin, two wires for +5v are being merged into one +5v pin on the PSU side (unless this cable also splits on the PSU side; but I’ve not seen that). \n\nWhile technically this does work and can work without problems, but if you decide to push the power limits and overclock, you could start to run to into some issues pretty quickly.",

      ">unless you want to keep your card for 4-5+ years\n\nShockingly, not everyone does yearly upgrades for the heck of it",
      "This isn't particularly an unpopular opinion, neither of the next gen consoles can get more than 10GB of VRAM and with features like DirectStorage coming to the PC which will allow you to stream textures directly to the GPU memory from a PCIe storage device the VRAM isn't going to be a big limitation even for textures which are absolutely insane and well above the point of diminishing returns. \n\nThe next gen engines are essentially built around asset streaming where both textures and geometry is streamed from fast PCIe storage directly to the GPU.\n\nI really don't know why AMD went for 16GB of GDDR6, could be just a numbers game, could be that their DCC color compression is still worse (still no DCC on ROPs for example) and it also looks like they will not be supporting inline compression for DirectStorage so they might need to compensate for that.\n\nAnd before people say remember Fury that's not the same case, the issue with the Fury was more complicated.\n\nThe Fury came out when consoles could already allocated more than its total VRAM (at least on the PS4 which allowed VRAM allocation of upto 6GB) and if a game say had to use 1GB extra than what the Fury could support you would be at a deficit of 25% that's a lot to swap in an out, and much harder to optimize for than 12.5-10% of a 8/10GB VRAM GPU today.\n\nThe APIs at the time of the Fury X were also much worse in terms of direct memory management, with DX12 and Vulkan you can do much better fine grain allocation and control combined with essentially zero copy access to system memory and to any memory mapped IO address space and you get a very different situation than 5 years ago.",
      ">  the unpopular opinion that 16GB isn't worth it for these cards.\n\nProblem is 16GB of VRAM might not even matter with these cards. They live/die on whether the infinity cache is being effectively used. If something is too large that there are a ton of cache misses the thing starts falling on its face. There exists the potential that nothing will be able to actually leverage that 16GB without slamming into the infinity cache limits like a truck into a concrete wall.",

      "These comparisons will always be interesting, but at  the same time pissing in the wind \n\nThe 6800xt is undoubtedly the better GPU, but the 4060ti will be more popular and outsell it regardless",
      "tl:dr; RX 6800 XT is:\n\n* 19% faster on average @ 1080p\n* 26% faster on average @ 1440p\n* 32% faster on average @ 4k",
      "Which is a damn shame. The 4060 series cards this generation are absolute dog shit, but people are already buying them in droves based on the latest steam hardware survey",

No but.. raytracing dlss 3d modeling ai something something the 1050ti literally had 0 advantages and it way outsold the 570. Kinda hopeless hoping people buy more amd cards today when it didn't happen back then. I just want some real competition which ultimately benefits the customer but if amd sells faster cards and Nvidia sells just as many cards as before we won't be getting that",
      "Prebuilts.\n\nOnce you realize like 90% of PC gamers are buying prebuilts, you will see why the 3050 outsold the 6700/6650 etc whatever.\n\nThe 4060/ti is going to be a huge prebuilt card, it’s likely going to outsell all of RDNA2 and 3 combined lol.",
      "In Germany the cheapest 4060ti 16GB is 550€, while the cheapest 6800 XT is 530€. DLSS3/frame gen and powerdraw alone should never be enough to warrant paying MORE for 20% less performance...",
      "RX 6800 16gb would be a better comparison, its faster, cheaper and more similar in efficiency.",
      "Now that would be shocking, given it's an *incredible* 128bit interface, compared to the 256bit interface of the 6800XT (and 3060 TI).\n\nIt truly is the worst card released in years.",
      "Well, still not regretting getting my 6800XT a year ago and for less than they currently sell for even.",
      "They use different nodes so die sizes aren't comparable. When you look at transistor counts (22.9 billion on 4060 Ti and 26.8 billion on the 6800 XT) you see that the 6800 XT has about 17% more transistors and is about that much faster at 1080p and even faster than that at higher resolutions. So technically speaking, in this situation, at higher resolutions AMD has better performance per transistor than NVIDIA, mostly due to the small 128 bit bus of the 4060 Ti. Also of course the 4060 Ti is the more efficient product because it uses the better node.",
      "Then don't watch it? It's really just that simple.",

For those who care, It's 23%, 30%, 37% without.  \n  \nWhat I found interesting is the 6800xt actually wins somewhat comfortably in most of the RT tests, but cyberpunk is notably where it loses badly. Not sure of the reasons (maybe it just does more ray tracing?) But now I'm realizing how often this game is used as a demonstration of the huge RT advantage Nvidia has, and - based on this data - it's actually an outlier. (Ie. AMD RT is obviously weak, but cyberpunk seems to exaggerate it)",
      "Literally no advantage?  How about power use?\n\nNormally that's not such a big deal, except the 1050 Ti can be entirely powered off the PCIe slot, whereas that's not possible for the 570.  That's a big difference for OEM builds where there's a premium just for a PSU that has a PCIe plug on it.",
      "I don't know, I do think it differs per region. In my area, the 4060TI 16GB is a cool 100 euro more than the 6800. That's not really a good comparison, as they are in a different price class.",
      "This is exactly why the 1050Ti did so well. It was the go to office PC upgrade card because it runs with no external power. \n\nI bought a 1060 6GB over a 480 8GB because the 1060 was marginally faster, used less power but also happened to be same price in stores! ~£230. \n\nIf you’re not winning the metrics you’ve got to win on price or you’re just not going to sell in to a dominant market. It’s pretty frustrating. \n\nIf the 480 8GB had have been 199 in store it would have been a no brainer.\n\nMan I wish 60 tier cards still cost those prices 😞",
      "Ada is impressive technologically. A damn shame they are just selling 30% over what they should.",
      "No problem, I hope he enjoys it.  \nHis milking helped me to buy RX6800 non-XT over 3070 and now I'm really happy that I went with his suggestions to buy 16GB card.",
      "I think the point is you can get the 4060ti and 6800xt for about the same price.",

I validated this with some benchmark runs (gaming and synthetic) and a socket wattmeter to measure any difference in total system power consumption (for which there was none between the two aformentioned drivers).\n\nI wouldn't worry - this isn't a case of new world bricking your GPUs like from a few months ago with those EVGA 3090s.\n\nHopefully this reporting bug can be fixed",

It's up to the manufacturer or AIB partner to ensure their limits and quality standards.",
      "The game did a thing that probably wasn't good (uncapped FPS menus).\n\nHowever, that shouldn't be capable of killing a GPU. Uncapped FPS Menus should be harmless, just a waste of electricity. Maybe make your PC kinda loud as all the fans ramp up to cool the GPU.\n\nIt was EVGA's fault that the cards _died_ due to it; because their firmware was incorrect. It's up to NVidia/EVGA to make sure that the firmware contains the proper power limits to prevent the card from self-destructing.\n\nThe game just happened to be the first time that conditions aligned correctly for the incorrect values in the firmware to actually cause _immediate_ hardware damage.

      "Nothing about this is shocking though. We knew the RT performance was pretty bad compared to Nvidia. It's their first generation, same as how Turing RT performance was terrible.  AMD is working on their own DLSS. And 4k difference comes down to memory bandwidth. I'm actually happy for the AMD crowd. It's about time there's a direct competitor to Nvidia. I'm a 4k player and have a 3080 but damn if this isn't exciting because it pushes Nvidia AND Amd to push the envelope. 1440p non RT performance is absolutely mind-blowing",

      "Those who are patient are now rewarded. The better value play here is the 3080 given these benchmarks given that it's only $50 more. People will buy whatever they can get their hands on, and if you're happy, great. But I think Nvidia's got my money for this round.",

AIBs cannot match the cooling performance of those for anywhere near MSRP.\n\nAnd yet every comparison ever is to the founders edition performance at MSRP price. When 99% of people owning 30X0 cards will have to pay more for partner cards of equivalent or worse cooling. Just to get parity with founders edition you have to pay $50 more for the best value AIB cards due to overclocks.\n\nThe channel, Moore’s Law is Dead was dead on about this. The FE price and thermal performance is locked in for reviews but most people will have to pay slightly more for either shittier cooling or a lot more for a card with parity. \n\nFor those lucky few getting MSRP FE 3080, it’s a great deal.",

      "Wait people (and not just bots) can actually win the AMD drop? Whole family has been trying for a year no luck! Congrats, nice to see a win for a real person!",
      "6900xts are pretty wildly available now for msrp or near msrp.  Newegg and microcenter have them.  They are third party cards. So a little more expensive than msrp but not bad at all for an aib.",
      "Thank you all, last Radeon gpu I had was a 9550 SE back in 2004! I've had the 6900 for only a couple of days but it really is a beast",
      "You will never see amd msrp again.  Unless you get a reference card.  Microcenter isn’t inflating the price, aib are.",
      "The packaging for the 6900XT from AMD is almost as nice as the card.",
      "Yep, managed to get it at msrp on the weekly amd drop (I'm in the EU). I tried for a while though but never got lucky and I've always had \"more than an hour\" in the estimated waiting time. But two weeks ago the queueing system put me in the top of the line 🤟🤟",
      "How much are these cards? Were you able to get it msrp?",
      "Every Thursday, at around 16:00, the AMD store start a gpu selling event (each drop has a different number of cards available, sometimes not so many, other times, like last week, drops are more consistent)\nYou will be placed in a queue, with the position on said queue assigned randomly. If you are lucky enough to be on the \"front positions\" of this virtual queue, you will be able to enter the online shop and buy one gpu.",
      "That's gonna be a huge jump. I went from a 970 to a 3070 ti and the jump in performance was enormous. Games that used to struggle to get 60 fps at 1080p medium settings are now running at 1440p 144+ fps at high settings (plus ray tracing in some games) \nI mean a game like doom eternal struggled a lot with my 970 at 1080p medium and now with dlss I can run the game at max settings, 1440p with ray tracing and get 144+ fps.",
      "Yeah you will...because the vast majority of PC gamers will not pay $1500 for a mid range GPU. I know I sure as hell won't.  If the prices don't come back down to some semblance of normalcy after the chip shortage is over. You're going to see the death of PC gaming. I love gaming on my PC. But there's no way I could ever justify a $1500 or $2000 video card when I can get an XBox Series S for $300.",
      "Am I the only one who thinks the RX 6000 reference cards look orgasmically good?",
      "That's a solid upgrade. You just went from hardly being able to play VR to playing on high settings. \n\nStrongly recommend a VR headset for your next buy if you don't have one. Congrats!",
      "Went from an RX580 8GB Sapphire Nitro+ to a 6800XT reference model.\n\nStill have my rx580...could've sold it for 150-200% the cost I paid for it..but I dunno.. sentimental value.",
      "What's your in game mhz?",
      "I'm in the EU, as well. What is this weekly AMD drop you talk about?",
      "Yep they get regular shipments.  Multiple a week.  The only issue is AIB companies have jacked their prices up so high it’s insane.  Between the component shortages and tariffs, they really ran with the price increases.  But this affects Nvidia too.",
      "From what I understand they are mostly abandoning the idea of MSRP in the GPU business right now. They've completely surrendered to scalpers and others driving prices up and decided to join them instead. This is partly due to everyone competing for space at TSMC instead of manufacturing their own stuff.",
      "God a 1060, how antiquated, send it to me and I'll 'dispose' it responsibly (cries on 750 Ti).",
      "This right here. MC has reference PowerColor 6900XT, 6800XT, and 6700XT in bulk pack boxes even. The 6900XT is 1399, 6800XT is 1099, and the 6700XT is 799. Better than their non reference where a 6800XT is 1349. However however still a good 300-400 over what AMD direct reference cards are. Tides are changing though. They keep getting more and more cards in quantity and model across the board and they are sitting on the shelves. So either people are giving up and holding out for new model drops, miner demand is easing, overall supply chain logistics are calming down or combination of those. So they certainly aren’t unattanium anymore. However pricing hasn’t yet really shifted accordingly.",
      "Got a merc319 6800xt the day XFX released them for MSRP.  Card beats the hell out of the 2080ti it replaced."

    "title": "Is my brain working right? Is this what we're thinking in terms of performance for 7900 XTX? Assuming it is 1.5x-1.7x over a 6950 XT.",
    "selftext": "",
    "comments": [
      "No. This is right. This is what AMD claimed.\n\nWe can't tell how true the numbers are until we get to benchmark it ourselves, though. But it looks great.",
      "Use the Techspot / Hub chart instead. TPU tested with a 5800X which did cause some slight CPU bottlenecking at 4K with the 4090.\n\nTechspot had the 4090 scoring 144fps in the 4k 13 game average and the 6900XT scoring 77 fps. The 54% perf/watt claim was for a 7900XTX at 300W (sneaky bastards) so that gets us to 119fps @ 300W. The extra bit of wattage will allow higher clocks but I expect that causes the perf/watt to drop off (otherwise AMD would have just compared stock vs stock like in prior launches) so lets say that extra 18% power only increases performance by 10% (might be generous but I don't know). That gets us to 130 fps in Techspot charts. Their 6950XT scored 85 fps in those charts and 1.54x that is 131fps so it is close IMO.\n\nGiven that that would make the 4090 about 10% faster than the 7900XTX in raster.\n\nThe 4080 16GB in the NV slides was about 20% ahead (using fantastic eyeball maths!) of the 3090Ti. That card scored 91fps in the techspot chart so that puts the 4080 16GB at around 110 fps.\n\nSo stack will probably look as follows for raster\n\n* 4090        144 fps ($1,600)\n* 7900XTX  131 fps ($999)\n* 7900XT    115 fps ($899)\n* 4080 16   110 fps ($1,200)\n* 4080 12   90 fps ($900) - or whatever it renamed to\n\nFor RT it might be more like (I did raster * 0.65 for NV and raster * 0.5 for AMD here)\n\n* 4090       94 fps ($1,600) 66 fps with new scaling\n* 4080 16   72 fps ($1,200) 51 fps with new scaling\n* 7900XTX  65 fps ($999) 41 fps with new scaling\n* 4080 12   59 fps ($899) 41 fps with new scaling\n* 7900XT    55 fps ($899) 37 fps with new scaling\n\nSo if you want RT performance then 4080 16 is not terrible, about 10% or so more performance for 20% more money. If you want raster then 7900XTX or XT are both good. If you want both you spend the $$ and go for a 4090.\n\nEDIT. I went through and checked the RT scaling at 4K in the games techspot tested. 4090 came out at 0.46x and 6950XT came out at 0.31x. Assuming the 4080 and 7900XTX are similar to those numbers I have updated the numbers to reflect that. It pans out that perf/$ is looking to be about the same for RT performance between NV and AMD but AMD will hold the advantage in raster which might offset the features NV have for some people, time will tell.",
      "Remember they did not compare it with the 4090 on purpose very different form last time when they showed 3090 on the charts. The 70% improvement is likely very rare and in a select few games. Expect the averages around 40-60%.",
      "I think AMD has been pretty accurate in their performance claims these recent years. They also don’t shy away from showing negative results",
      "90% performance at ~85% power and ~$600 cheaper is still quite good tho.",
      "All the marketing bullshit aside its probably 1.5x. Still impressive fps/$.",
      "But the benches they showed were still accurate.\n\nJust like i  this they didnt show a 4090. But based on their claims we know it is right around a 4090 in perfor.ance (assuming it is accurate which is tbd)",

      "Its not right. This benchmark is using a 5800x which bottlenecks the 4090 even at 4k. The other issue is that AMD only showed 6 games and said 'Up to 1.5x and 1.7x the 6950' this is the best case scenario, not the average one.\n\nIf the 7900 XTX was faster than a 4090 or even a bit slower AMD would've given us detailed performance benchmarks, but they completely avoided it, just like they avoided comparing Zen 4 to the 5800x3D.",

      "Slow down buddy lol. You've got 14-30 days to reconsider your purchase. I'm aware this is a pro-AMD subreddit, but there's no sense in making split decisions without knowing how these cards compare. With that said, you could use the money saved to invest in a full AMD build that'll surely out-pace a 4090 FE 👍",
      "I hope the 7900XTX humiliates the 4080. On paper the 7900XTX should destroy the 4080 with ease. 12 billion more transistors, 20-30% more bandwidth, 4GB more memory.. Die size of the 4080 is just 380mm2. 7900XT is like 520mm2 with chiplets included.",
      "Yeah, I mean we're talking about a freaking $600 price difference. That's a whole ass 6900xt (current) price difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish people had more sense than money.",
      "I mean that's not them being inaccurate, they just didn't make that comparison cause they didn't like it.",
      "Don't forget these are \"up-to\" numbers from AMD - not average like all other benchmarks.  The real average numbers are going to be much less than what the maximum frames are.  Even more so depending on your CPU.",
      "If you care about ray tracing a lot you should keep the 4090 order, a 60% RT gain over the 6950 XT won’t place the 7900 XTX anywhere near the 4090.\n\nIf RT isn’t a big concern however, it looks like AMD will be much better value at the top end."

A massive amount of work has been done to untie these from X and make them stand on their own.\n\nThis allows things like graphics outside of the display server, using 3D acceleration on a headless server, passing references to graphics buffers between processes without copying them to the CPU, etc.\n\nIf you've ever heard of Wayland, it uses all of these separated components to provide a modernized display server.\n\nThe Nvidia drivers pretend this all doesn't exist and doesn't support any of it. When Nvidia was asked to support the features that literally every GPU support by Linux except for Nvidia does, they said they didn't like how it was done and supporting it was too much work for them.

It used to be *much* more common in the era when you got some junky ”500w” thing with your case.)",

Not sure what else is drawing power, but a physical HDD runs about 5-10 watts/each drive.  Not sure about memory.\n\nI think AMD or EVGA is at fault for this one.",

      "Hello, someone with engineering experience here -\n\nIt's not bullshit. The failure mode is pretty simple:\n\nPower = Voltage * Current.\n\nPower supplies provide a fixed voltage (12v). Card draws whatever current it needs to meet power demand.\n\nCard demand goes up. Card tries to draw more power than psu can handle. Psu begins to sag, voltage drops below 12v.\n\nCard has the same power demand, but is now being fed lower voltage. Power = Voltage * Current, if power is same and voltage goes down, current has to go up.\n\nCard draws more current to try to meet power demand. Psu sags more, voltage goes down, card getting less power per unit of current and thus increases current draw to make up.\n\nVicious cycle.\n\nUsually a psu's over-current protection will trip out and your rig will be safe.\n\n1. Not all psu's have good OCP.\n2. What happens if power demand is riight below trip point? Psu keeps running, but card is being undervolted and continues to draw higher than normal current.\n\nSo the card keeps running. But then, current through some component causes it to heat up too much. Component begins to fail, usually by becoming a short. Draws looots more current now and milliseconds later pops.\n\nEt viola, dead computer smell.",
      "I'm sorry for your experience. But that is definitely not what happened here. \n\nYour PSU and cabling might've overheated because of the high current that it couldn't handle, and that heat might've transferred to your GPU and done it in as well.\n\nWhat happened with OP though was the opposite. If anything it sounds like a short or overvoltage on the GPU itself, maybe it blew a capacitor as a result. You wouldn't see the type of failure OP saw from an overheat of the PSU due to a current level above its rating.",
      "wtf... whoever came up with the idea that a lower wattage psu caused your 6900 XT to explode should lose their job, that makes zero fucking sense, also amd officially recommends 750w and even then 650w is more than enough",
      "TL:DR: Most likely the GPU would work after you use soldering iron to remove the burnt component and cleaned with PCB cleaner. If they refused to pay for a warranty, i think it is worth a short in repairing this GPU.\n\nFrom the picture, it seems like a ceramic capacitor has exploded. My guess would be that the ceramic capacitor itself has some QC issue and it starts to degrade faster than normal and a leakage current started to flow through them. When the leakage current is high enough, it would burn. Since the package size is small (either a 0805 or 0603) ,even when it is \"burning\" there is still a relative small amount of current flowing through and i won't be worrying that the extra current would damage the large power plane inside the PCB. \n\n(I don't have the power ratings for ceramic capacitors, but usually resistors in that package could only handle 250mW before the burn, which is just a small fraction of power compared to 300W+ that the GPU would suck in)\n\nSince you said the GPU is still running when the component is burning. I think all the power rails would be working.\n\nIf you have a multimeter, you could use connectivity check function to check if there is a short circuit between the black capacitor with the lable C604 across it (should be the main power rail to GPU) and between the small across the brown capacitor C630 that is right beside the burnt component. If the power rail is not short to GND. I think it is very likely that the GPU could boot up again after the burnt component is removed with soldering iron and is properly cleaned. That ceramic capacitor should be used for filtering the 12V voltage right before the input of the buck converter.  Usually there are a surplus of them soldered on the board and missing a couple of them should be fine as long as the power rails are not short circuit to each other and the GPU + VRAM are still in working condition.\n\nAnother tip when asking for warranty is always play dumb. Always say that you used the recommended part and you have never touch any setting of the GPU and it just blow up on its own. The more specific info you provide, the more likely they would find a bullshit reason to refuse the warranty claim",
      "It’s an easy way out, if op didn’t say what was their psu, it would fine, any company will use anything in their favour  to deny warranty, happened to me with my car",
      "It took out one of the 5870’s as well, forgot to add that it also melted one of the power cables. Nothing major but the case was smoking for a good 10min. I posted this over in the AMD forums about a decade ago. If I find the post I’ll link so you can see the damage.",
      "Switch mode power supply, MOSFETs could have failed to open for a brief period of time causing more than 12v to be fed into the gpu...\n\nThough I would have expected EVGA to have overcurrent protection to prevent this from happening.",
      "I agree with your general sentiment here, but from my reading of OP's post, the PSU hasn't failed. Moreover, his PSU looks pretty decent (650W 80+ Platinum). He said he swapped in a low-end GPU for the time being and the PC is working again. \n\nConsequently, I'd pull the blame away from the PSU and put it towards the build quality of the GPU. OP was running the GPU stock as well, so its electrical load under gaming (in combination with the efficient 5800X3D) should've been manageable by their high-quality PSU. \n\nWhat you said does make sense though, so I'm not discounting that. I just don't think that's the case here."

If you can get the 6700xt for ~70€ less than the 6750xt I would be more inclined to go that route as opposed to the 6750xt (MSRP prices compared).  Now, if the 6700XT is around the same price as the 6750XT that changes things.  Performance difference is minimal (2-5% from what I have seen).\n\nAs far as either vs the 3070Ti, that is a personal value proposition.  The 3070Ti has much better performance in many games and doesn't really ever lose to the 6700/6750XT.  It also has better ray tracing and includes DLSS.  Is that worth the price difference?  Very personal question.  I recently went back and forth on the same thing, and decided to go ahead and get a 6700 XT from AMD Direct.

Should have done a refresh like 2080->2080S than this garbage\n\nI hope marketing students use AMD and Nvidia as case studies, because this is a perfect illustration of how mindshare warps the reception of a product.\n\nThe RTX 2080 --> 2080 Super was a significant price increase. You got 10% more performance for 20% more money. The 2080 Ti should've been $700, the 2080 should've been $500, and the 2070 should've been $400.

You get 3090 Ti performance for almost half the price, but this is apparently not enough.\n\nThe 3090 Ti ($2000) and 6950 XT ($1100) are neck-and-neck, yet Nvidia get praised while AMD get slated.

      "This is probably result of using this particular card type with this particular PSU. The strongest coil whine will appear if card draws power at a pattern that happens to be a resonance frequency of the PSU coils. Probably both EVGA models were equipped with the exact same coil, resulting in whine.",
      "Update 1/19/21:\n\nEVGA contacted me regarding whether or not they could help with RMA. They said that since the 750W G2 Supernova Gold was purchased as an \"EVGA Certified\" product EVGA reduced the warranty from 10 years to 1 year which means that even though the product was like new directly from EVGA, the warranty expired a couple years ago. They count the day it became \"EVGA Certified\" as the first day of warranty and not the first day the consumer purchased the product.\n\nBackstory:\n\nI upgraded my GTX 1060 6GB to a RX 6900XT. For first time ever in rig I heard awful coil whine that could be heard in the room next door. I'm an RN and used my stethoscope from work to assess PC before I blamed the GPU entirely. Turned out almost all of the noise was originating from my EVGA Supernova 750W G2 Gold PSU.\n\nMy first thought was maybe the PSU was always bad but I never realized it because my 1060 never put that much load on it for me to notice. I went to Best Buy and bought a new EVGA 700W Bronze PSU to test and the noise was almost identical.\n\nI decided to try one more PSU but from whatever other brand Best Buy had. I exchanged the EVGA for a Corsair RM750W Gold and the PSU buzzing went away entirely. There's still a tiny bit from the GPU only, but it's enjoyable once again to play games/music at night in quiet room while the kids are sleeping.\n\nI hope this might help someone exploring the same problem.",
      "Most brands have high and low quality units. \nIn general, if you are seeing a particular wattage for much less than others (wow, saving ten bucks!) you are often going to end up with much less clean power. \n\nOne of the most consistent PSU brands is definitely Seasonic though.",
      "Do you think it has anything to do with the brand? Or is it possible I was extremely unlucky with two EVGA units?",
      "Seasonic as a brand is still top-notch, agreed. They also make a lot of OEM units for other brands. I think some (usually more expensive) Corsair PSUs are actually made by Seasonic as well.",

      "My 2011 vintage Corsair HX750i started screaming at the slightest provocation (even SSD load) before I replaced it with a Seasonic TX-750.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy reference RX 6800 XT had slight bit of whine that got better after the first few days, but dear lord, if you put an EK waterblock on your card, and you opt to also put a backplate on, don't tighten down the central 4 screws, else the backplate becomes an emitter for coil whine that projects it across the house.",
      "Yeah the backstory made it more clear. I have coil whine on my 6800XT, my PSU is fine. It's an SF750 so it better be, since it's a 80+ Platinum :D",
      "Yes. I picked up an RM850i Corsair PSU, and it was refurbished, right from Corsair’s factory in Texas. You get the OEM box, instead of Corsair’s fancy box and it has a tiny Seasonic logo on it.\nPerfectly quiet PSU, btw.",
      "I have the XFX 6800XT 319 Merc. It uses the same PCB and power delivery system from a 6900XT. \n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't fit in my computer case so I am waiting for a new case to arrive. As a result, it's on my open test bench, about 6\" to the left of my keyboard. Fortunately, it's the very first GPU I've owned where I cannot hear the coil whine. My 2080ti FE, 1080ti FTW3, and GTX690 all screamed and whined like banshees and we're audible from inside their respective chassis.\n\nI've used Seasonic, SilverStone, EVGA, AND Corsair PSUs and it's never made a lick of difference in GPU noise. There was probably something else that changed in the power equation (i.e. surge protector or power cable).",
      "\"bequiet\" ironic",
      "ho jesus that actually happened to me! GTX970 going like 8000fps on the game Symphony on steam. This was my first time hearing such noise i thought my pc was gonna blow up!",
      "In my experience, it's just a tossup if a paired combo whines or not. For example:\n\nPSU1 and GPU1 has coil whine.\n\nPSU2 and GPU2 has no coin whine.\n\nPSU1 and GPU2 has no coil whine\n\nPSU2 and GPU1 has no coil whine.\n\n\nCoil whine doesn't mean the card sucks, or the PSU sucks, it just means that together they are causing those caps to resonate at an annoying frequency.",
      "> This is probably result of using this particular card type with this particular PSU.\n\nWe recently got back an EVGA 750BQ power supply from a client complaining about coil whine in the PSU. I tested it with a GTX 560 (my work computer) running the Heaven benchmark. Tons of coil whine and very noticeable, especially when it transitions between scenes. It was very similar sounding to the 700BR in this video.",
      ">But have you ever heard a 970 doing 8000fps on main menus? Awful.\n\nI have. And mine have been completely silent all the time I've had it. However, a friend recently borrowed it, and he called me to complain about the coil whine.\n\nSo I'm pretty sure it's the specific configuration, most like the PSU, that's the real culprit here.",
      "FPS limiter at for example, 300, has absolutely no downsides.\n\nAs long as it's slightly above the refresh rate, you're fine.\n\nI'm running a 70hz display and have a global FPS limiter at 100, and everything works well with no inputlag whatsoever. No tearing issues, either."

      "AMD confirmed that more reference cards will be made for all models. But given that at most AMD is only getting at most 60 GPUs per wafer and Nvidia is getting at most 50 GPUs per wafer for both companies largest dies, don't expect supply to normalize any time soon. Keep in mind that that's only 140,000 TSMC 7nm wafers processed every month in total. And AMD has between 44,000 and 70,000 of those (we know that no customer is over 50% and some customers have dropped without disclosing who the allocation went to). Nvidia is using Samsung 8nm and we aren't sure how many wafers they're buying or even how many wafers per month Samsung is making on 8nm versus their 7nm process. But total supply to Nvidia is likely between 100-300% of what AMD is using at TSMC for GPUs based on what numbers look like in wholesale channels.\n\nMy guess is that Nvidia probably has around 10k-15K wafers/mo for all of its Ampere products including the A100 which is currently out of stock with earliest possible delivery via air being listed as 3 weeks. And AMD is likely only dedicating 2-3K wafers/mo to their high-end GPUs with the vast majority of their TSMC 7nm wafer allotment being slotted for console APUs, processors, and low- and mid-range GPUs that are launching next year. Furthermore, AMD also is starting to fulfill CDNA which is a 120 CU  computer focused GPGPU solution for data centers which features better FP16, FP32, and FP64 performance compared to Nvidia's A100 and has already been ordered in bulk, along with the not yet publicly released new Epyc processors for the first two exascale supercomputers.\n\nOh, and to top this all off, we've had shortages of the following so far this year:\n\n* Screws\n\n* Shipping containers from China\n\n* Shipping containers to China\n\n* Air freight capacity due to decreased intercontinental flights and now vaccine deployment\n\nAnd all of that is affecting the ability to move produced products from Asia to the rest of the world. Not to mention the fact that shipping is taking longer due to COVID-19 mitigations that slow down the loading and unloading of ships, planes, trains, and trucks.",

      "No. The mining craze was way worse. I know it first hand because I bought my RX 580 back then and I remember that I had to wait for months to get it.\n\n\nIt eventually got to a point where the only card that was readily available was the GT 1030 (even the RX 550s were selling out immediately). At least currently I can still buy an RX 5000-series card or an RTX 20-series card if I needed to.",

That MPO issue drove me nuts as I thought that it was just AMD drivers being AMD drivers.\n\nTurning off hardware acceleration is not a workable band-aid at that. I was pulling my hair out from audio cutout when I watch youtube after doing that. I can now safely conclude that the whole thing about AMD driver sucks isn't really an excuse anymore.",
      ">while others, again using the same GPU and drivers etc\n\nThat doesn't even come close to covering all the possible differences.\n\nSome people for example fixed black screen issues by turning off their RAM overclock.   Just because an app crashes for some, and not others, could be hardware, but it could also be all sorts of other software.  MSI Afterburner for example was known to cause crashes for some.  Windows has bugs and features that are only active for some in some situations (e.g. only with multi monitor with different refresh rates but only if all support 10 bit color).\n\nSo \"one friend with drivers ABC and card X has the issue but the other does not\" is nowhere close to proving that it is bad hardware.",

Like someone was fiddling with my display port cables, but it was across all 3 screens at the same time for 1 to 2 frames, then would dissapear.\n\nI was never getting driver timeouts, just the black screen flickering and video issues in other windows in chrome, what fixed me was using the #angle workaround in chrome.\n\nSince then, for me, its been perfect on 22.9.1, no issues AT ALL.

I painstakingly went back and forth in various areas turning RT on and off…long story short, youre missing very little.

The power consumption in Time Spy is  around 285W, the card constantly boosts to 2500 and my graphics score is well above 21,000 while my hot spot temp is below 95c (reference card). Since you have an AIB card and a Zen3 CPU, you should get even better results.",

      "Great looking build and awesome GPU! Just a little advice I would not use pigtail pcie cables with that high end of a GPU that draws a butt load of power. You have a decent PSU but you need to use a dedicated cable for each 8 pin connection and if you dont have that many pcie connections coming from your PSU you need to get a higher rated one that does. At the least you can lose performance (been shown on Jayz2cents and BuildZoid's channels) and at the worst you can damage your GPU and PSU.",

      "With OP's Seasonic PSU, I wouldn't worry at all - it's built for this!\n\nLarger diameter cables and a matching internal design [single rail(!), bigger caps to handle transients, higher rated mosfets, thicker cables] make sure that drawing 300W and more over that daisy-chained cable isn't a problem. \n\nThe \"weak points\" are the connectors and those are also what's rated for those 150W each.\n\nHowever, an 8pin EPS is built the same when it comes to the physical pin design, i.e. thickness of the metal and contact area (only difference: EPS uses 4 12V pins instead of 3), is rated for 336W and regularily pushed higher in servers. Accounting for having one 12V pin less, a PCIe 8pin is still good for at least 252W.\n\nParticularily in OP's case, these two cables with 3 connectors can definitely and comfortably provide enough power for the GPU, AND have some headroom left. In cheaper built and multi-rail PSUs, having more cables is needed, but not here.\n\nI have also verified this with my HX850i by pushing a Vega 56 to 360W ASIC and now with my 6800XT. Performance difference: zero. EMI is reduced by using more cables though.",
      "Awesome! I would refrain hitting your GPU with a heavy work load until you get rid of that pigtail. From what users like the other commenter have noted 400W power draw from there 6900/6950xt's. The max rating of an 8 pin pcie cable 150w/12.5a, so with only 2 cables the most you can safely pull is 300w so you really need that 3rd cable stat!",

There were 6700xt in stock 45 minutes after the queue opened last week so don't just nope out if you get a long queue time.

Don't refresh the page too quickly or you'll get softbanned when checking for the pre-queue to start.

Coming from car knowledge, larger rad does not mean lower temperatures, it means sustaining low temperatures for longer (e.g. the 120mm would heat soak faster than a 360mm), but that can be resolved with a faster fan. So even though you have a 360mm rad on CPU, it won't cool it effectively when there is only so much contact area (big cold plate, but small and dense CPU die).  My friend is cooling his 3700X with a 120MM AIO just as well as I am cooling my 3700X with a 280MM AIO, only in sustained workloads his system might be a bit louder and a bit warmer. Plus the GPU core is in direct contact with the vapor chamber of the cooler, not going through an integrated heat spreader, which would lose some efficiency in heat transfer any time you are going from one material to another.",

The M2C uses a toolless snap system (you can barely see the snap-in points at the top) whereas the Meshify C uses 4 thumbscrews to secure the glass panel.\n* Mesh panel is slightly more offset in the front panel since the Meshify 2 Compact's mesh front panel is a door that swings open.\n* Feet are different, M2C is blocky like this whereas Meshify C has smaller silver round feet.\n* Screws holding the top panel on instead of just rivets, since the top panel is fully removable now.\n* No branding on the PSU shroud.\n* Cutout in the PSU shroud is now two segments so you can remove only part of it for radiator if you wish.\n\nLooks very much the same but these little differences speak to how much thought was put into redesign work for this series.

If you're trying to fill a bucket once a minute, doing so from a single faucet will require you to turn it up so high that a bunch of water splashes out.

    "title": "WOOO! Just achieved the second highest 6900xt port royal score in the world!",
    "selftext": "After the latest driver update I was finally able to push my 6900xt to the second highest port royal score in the world! Feels pretty good an I am extremely happy with the overclocking potential of rdna 2 especially if we are ever able to increase the voltage limit.\n\n[https://www.3dmark.com/search#advanced?test=pr%20P&cpuId=&gpuId=1353&gpuCount=0&deviceType=ALL&memoryChannels=0&country=&scoreType=overallScore&hofMode=false&showInvalidResults=false&freeParams=&minGpuCoreClock=&maxGpuCoreClock=&minGpuMemClock=&maxGpuMemClock=&minCpuClock=&maxCpuClock=](https://www.3dmark.com/search#advanced?test=pr%20P&cpuId=&gpuId=1353&gpuCount=0&deviceType=ALL&memoryChannels=0&country=&scoreType=overallScore&hofMode=false&showInvalidResults=false&freeParams=&minGpuCoreClock=&maxGpuCoreClock=&minGpuMemClock=&maxGpuMemClock=&minCpuClock=&maxCpuClock=)\n\nFor reference my build is\n\n\\-Reference 6900xt with ekwb custom loop\n\n\\-5950x on same loop\n\n\\-g.skills trident z 16 gb 4000 downclocked and tightened to 3600 cl14\n\n\\-2tb Samsung 970 evo\n\n\\-Gpu stats, 2740-2840 boost set, 1175mv, power limit increased to 365w max +15%, mem at 2124mhz fast timings.\n\nTo be clear I don't use those settings 24/7 I drop to 2700-2800 clocks and maintain around 2730mhz sustained 100%load in games, power draw around 330w. Still really happy with the score and hoping in the future we can get custom bios options to increase further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - just to give everyone some more info, I made a post a while ago about my initial findings with overclocking the 6900xt. Those all pretty much stay true today. Basically if you have good cooling, maxing the voltage to 1175mv (which is what it runs stock btw), and upping your power limit by at least 50w or more through morepower tool should let almost every 6900xt perform about the same as me give or take. If you are power limited (like all stock cards) and you don't want to mess with morepowertool, then an undervolt will give you great results. and if you are thermally limited I'd do undervolt as well. You can see my post here with more details. There is a HUGE misconception that an undervolt with these cards is the end all be all. That is only the case if thermally or power throttled. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/kw0hos/some\\_info\\_learned\\_from\\_6900xt\\_overclocking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/kw0hos/some_info_learned_from_6900xt_overclocking/)\n\nAlso a ton of people probably have an undervolt setting in place and don't even realize that it's not being used. The radeon software, or powerplay tables seem to do whatever the hell they want if they don't like what you put in. If you have say a undervolt to 1080mv it might not even be applied. To test this simply boot up your undervolt profile. download a program called gpu-z, most of you probably have that already. Launch your game or benchmark of choice that stresses the gpu 100% (this is very important). And then while it is running, launch gpu-z and navigate to the sensors tab, if it reads 1175mv for the gpu core your undervolt settings are being ignored.\n\nPlease be warned though, morepowertool goes past the power limits from amd and if you mess something up it can kill your card. I haven't heard of this happening yet, and it certainly hasn't happened to me but it is a possibility. Know the risk. The chances of it are very small I'd wager since amd tends to over engineer the boards a little but keep it in mind. ",

      "Damn a lot of negativity in the comments.\n\nCongrats OP that's super cool! I got mine in the top 9% on air and called it a day haha. Should try again with the new driver.\n\nI really love this card from a pure hardware standpoint. I can't justify using it over my 3090 right now without a DLSS alternative but I very much prefer the 6900XT as a GPU. way less heat output, and OCing is fairly straight forward and rewarding, while for the 3090 wattage gets out of hand really quickly (I'm a SFF enthusiast).\n\nDo you by any chance have game benchmarks of your card as well? Shadow of the tomb raider for example.",

I totally get why some would be frustrated and maybe take my post as a way to brag(which it's not lol). I was just really happy with my luck and excited that amd is once again at the forefront with gpus. The results you can get on rdna 2 from overclocking remind me of the golden overclocking days 10 years ago. Congrats on getting both of your cards as well!\n\nEdit- also I don't own shadow of the tombraider, which I would be very interested in benchmarking since I know that game typically sees amd far in the lead. I could run through ac valhalla, cyberpunk, and a few others if it's really of interest to people.",

      "I don't really understand your comment. Amd cpu's are now legitimately better than intel in every use case, hence the higher price now. They have also been killing intel in market share. If you are referring to the scores in port royal. 1. it's a raytracing benchmark and NVidia is way better at that, and 2. cpu really makes almost no difference in this test minus maybe a few percentage points since it's a gpu only benchamrk.",

      "Hopefully the rumors are true and stock will start to stabilize over the next few months. But then again we've heard that one before...",
      "I know I can't compete with NVidia when it comes to raytracing but I just wanted to share my excitement from just how much I was able to push out of my card. Before I put a custom loop on it and upped the power, my reference 6900xt was around a score of 9500 in port royal. So it has improved a huge amount. \n\nCongrats on the 3090 btw, that's an amazing card as well.",
      "I wrote \"in the world\" because that's exactly what it is. The second best 6900xt score \"in the world\". I mentioned nothing about any other cards.",

      "Its quite telling they are not comparing it to the regular 6600XT, 6700XT and 6900XT because the uplift is probably 5% at most and would make the price incease compared to the models that launched over a year ago comical.\n\nWe're probably in for a trashing in the reviews once the embargo lifts in a few hours.",

      "7xxx series will probably be positioned way higher performance-wise and price-wise. Only the 6950XT is probably in the same performance tier as N33, but others are higher.",
      "The pricing is likely reflective of what AMD views at the least medium term outlook for GPU pricing to be and they have much more data than consumers/media/etc. to work with. The rumored pricing of Intel's roughly 3060 competitor being $380 also supports similar predictions.\n\nThis means it seems like they feel that the RTX 3060 will likely stall around the $400 mark as opposed to falling down to MSRP range in the low $300s. Likewise the 3060ti will remain around the $500 mark versus falling down to the low $400s. In other words the overall downward price trend for GPUs has reached a stall point.",

      "I'll be short with you, 700 watts is probably enough for this GPU in some circumstances, but if you want this GPU to hit it's full potential in games, you're running a pretty high end CPU. 700 watts probably isn't enough and AMD recommends higher than 700 watts for a reason.",
      "700 still ain't enough for this card, I have a system with a 5800x and a 6900xt that pulls down 670 Watts in some situations.\n\nOh and it's a card with no overclocks, 700 isn't enough and you don't own the card to advise on this, I do.",
      "....Except a PSU is nowhere near the RRP of a 6900XT and they're directly related?\n\n\nIt's the same exact analogy as saying if you can't afford to maintain a vehicle, you can't afford the vehicle.",
      "I think the 6900xt is a lot more efficient than the 3090.",
      "What do you mean 'nope' lmao, even retail a 6900XT is $1000USD, a quality PSU is <$150.\n\n\nRegion and finances do not matter because power supplies are cheap relative to a literal top of the line GPU - hence why your argument is nonsense.\n\n\nIt's like buying a car that calls for premium fuel and putting lower grade fuel in it because you can't afford it lol, it makes absolutely zero sense.",
      "Okay so lots of replies here aren't going into _why_ the PSU is bad. \n\nThere are two reasons: (1) Brand and quality of components (2) The White rating is very low\n\nQuality of components means a lot more on a PSU than it does, say, a motherboard (though tbf it matters there too, the results just won't be as catastrophic). A PSU with low quality components can perform to _specifications_ (ie can it supply 700W peak) but the average capacity (RMS) will not be anywhere close to that. Which brings me to the White rating\n\nThe ratings of a PSU tell you how efficient the power supply is input vs. output. A higher efficiency (among other things) means less of your input power is wasted as heat. So if you have a super low efficiency PSU, your 800W at the load looks a lot more like 925W at the wall. Taking this (very oversimplification, apologies to any EE who reads this) toy example, we can estimate that 20% of the load (125W) is expelled as heat, resulting in 80% efficiency (the 80+ part). 125W of heat is more heat than your CPU TDP, and the PSU doesn't even have an AIO to keep it cool. So what happens when the PSU starts to get too hot? One of two things:\n\n1. The voltage is what it is and may droop a bit, but the current may be limited at the PSU causing a cascade of components to summarily reduce their performance because they can't draw enough power without reducing their own voltage. This could result in slowdowns or (more likely) hard resets if it happens very fast. \n\n2. The PSU components (being the above brand, this is likely) will fail and either (1) send a voltage spike through your system frying your $2k GPU/mobo, etc. or (2) melt and cause a short (shutting everything down), hopefully before reaching the flash point of any component at the short point and igniting something (or both of these could happen). \n\nMoral of the story, as others have said, if you have this GPU that's awesome, in this climate I'm sure you earned it. But please wait to put it in your system until you can get a better PSU. Patience may save you both money and your dwelling.",
      "Does this \"simple research\" include looking at the website for the actual card itself? Because if it does you need to take a look at your reading comprehension skills. Sapphire recommends an 850W PSU as a minimum. Could you theoretically run it on a 700W PSU, probably, if you use a low power CPU. Should you? Absolutely not, because your options are a) reduced performance/random shutdowns from lack of power, or b) reduced performance due to CPU bottleneck.",
      "Honestly, it probably could with a 65W TDP processor, but if you go all out on a GPU **don't cheap out on the PSU**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBTW, spending money on a bigger & better PSU is not a waste, rumors suggest crazy TDP numbers for new GPU's next year, you would need an upgrade anyway.",
      "If anyone thinks that running a PSU at its limit in the long term is a good idea for either the PSU or the expensive components that are plugged into it, then they do not know enough.\n\nEdit: Especially with an 80+ white rating",
      "You are a giant doucher, no doubt about that.",
      "How's this for your logic - if OP can afford that GPU but can't afford a PSU to run it properly then wtf is the point of buying that GPU in the 1st place.\n\nExactly..."

That could very well be different on the 40 series but I see no point in following ray tracing till it's more of a standard in games other than triple A titles. I noticed the difference in say Minecraft but that's really just Minecraft getting an update to old visuals. I play loads of single player titles and in every one of them ray tracing was a gimmick for a few things that just tanks fps. \n\nI'm pretty happy with my 6950xt but I also still have my 3070ti if I ever get the itch to stream, record, or play Minecraft with RT on.

Running around in RT overdrive at 80-90 fps in CP77 on a 4070 is something nothing from AMD can do (even if they get an FSR3 frame doubler the base RT performance isn't there on a 7900XTX. Maybe RDNA4 will get it right.)\n\nIt's a great experience for single player narrative driven stuff.",

Period. Now it's dropped down to $750ish range headed towards $700ish and leaves little room for a 7800XT. Would not expect anything different from the AMD Radeon team tough. It's no wonder they took ATI's near 50% market share in this segment and pretty much nearly lost it all.",

Except 3090 has twice as much VRAM and actually performs better in games (it also outperforms 6950XT).\n\nPersonally I **really** don't see a point of spending 600+ USD on a 12GB VRAM card that also happens to be the weakest xx70 in a looong while (compared to full sized dies). This thing is gonna be dead within a generation so there's no difference between it and outright buying a used card.\n\nIf it has to be AMD - there are thousands of 6900XTs on ebay often sold at below $500.

It´s the same with ALL the OCSUPERPOWER cards, no matter which brand. \n\nIn that test, alone the fact that the spikes in power consumption are similar to a stock version shows me even a stock card is capable of drawing a lot of power if you let it. (for example, by raising the power limit in the driver...)  Yes, the asrocks components might be of higher quality, yes, the power delivery might be more stable in long term. but TWICE the price?

I mean, 100% fan speed is nice but you would be going deaf with some fans and cooler designs if your pc were next to you on your desk. For AMD, Powercolor seems to do well together with MSI and Gigabyte, but it differs per 6700, 6800 and 6900, obviously.",

You pay a (substantial) premium to get something OEM validated at those higher clocks with cooling designed to handle it. Is that worth the price? Well, if that's the question you're asking, then it's not an option aimed at you.",

      "Stock power draw of 390w? ASRock basically set MPT for you, lol.",
      "Not a fan of the design nor the cooling solution on this card but the performance is impressive regardless. Too bad it will probably sound like a jet engine.",
      "It comes down to binning, the chips in these cards are the higher quality ones. In a lot of reviews and benchmarks the higher end cards are able to overclock higher than reference chips.",
      "Yeah, once you have read one review of a GPU you have basically read them all anyway. It's all mostly minor differences between all the versions and performance is fundamentally within the same ball park.",
      "It might seem counter intuitive, but waterblocks can lead to some surface components getting hotter than heatsinks since no air is flowing over the PCB.  Those components aren't usually super temperature sensitive, but I remember in the days of old when the first GPU water cooling efforts resulted in dead GPUs despite low temperature readings.  Modern blocks will make contact with everything that needs cooling and often will couple to the coils to act as another means for the PCB to shed heat.",

      "As big as RT is, it's not just RT.\n\nIt's also:\n\n* Tensor AKA Matrix accelerators (DLSS/DLDSR) - Not present on any current or even future announced AMD hardware, but a core part of Nvidia's Turing/Ampere/Lovelace architectures and Intel's Xe. Clearly the future of GPU's and already shockingly good.\n\n* DSR - Far inferior integration in AMD driver and perhaps hardware.\n\n* NVENC + related video capture API's (Nvidia paid developers to help the OBS team and other developers integrate these API's, AMD doesn't have the API nor the employees)\n\n* Reflex - Not present in AMD software, requires driver and game engine integration. Nvidia identified the need for the tech with a community member, created it, has a bunch of developers assigned to help companies integrate it into their games and engines and now it's in IIRC 8 of the top 10 FPS games and several of the most popular open game engines like Unreal.\n\n* Proper adaptive sync (incl. features like variable overdrive) - Hardware not present, essential for good VRR yet brushed under the rug because it makes them look bad. Third party reviews or Nvidia branding are the only reliable ways to know that your VRR display which VRR's with an AMD GPU will work even half decently.\n\n* OpenGL/DX9/DX11 api performance - been hammering them for this since the 7970 was the shiny new toy, it never happened. This matters to many people who play games like Minecraft, OSRS or generally older games. People are still upgrading their gtx970's to 6900xt's, losing 30-50% of their FPS and asking me why it happened.\n\n* Product support duration. AMD has recently rebadged old architectures as current gen over and over and over again, then dropped support for features that they could run perfectly while they were still being sold as new for no reason other than not having any employees to write the code.\n\nMost people care about at least one of those things, personally i use them all every week and most of them every day. More than a few are nothing short of revolutionary.\n\nIf they want to charge Nvidia pricing they need Nvidia performance, feature set and driver team. If you don't have parity, then every loss needs to be met with an equally sized win (which just doesn't exist) or with a discount. If their hardware was massively cheaper than Nvidia's for a given raster performance then i would recommend them carefully to a few people who don't care about these features, but that hasn't happened in a very long time and the list of people who don't care about any is getting smaller by the day.",

It's one of those things they literally did a study and almost nobody could notice! The DLSS makes a bit more sense especially if you are trying to push super high frames, but AMD looks to be evening the playing field with FSR 2.0, so to me it's almost a wash at this point.",

Long overdue, the day has finally come—an AMD graphics card is able to overtake NVIDIA's current-generation flagship graphics card! Who would have thought that just a year ago. This makes the ASRock RX 6900 XT OC Formula 7% faster than the AMD reference RX 6900 XT, 12% faster than the GeForce RTX 3080, and 13% faster than the RX 6800 XT. Very impressive numbers. There are still some RTX 3090 custom designs, like the ASUS STRIX and MSI Suprim, that are yet a little bit faster than the OC Formula.\"",
      "Absolutely, again I never thought in a million years I'd even consider a 1k GPU, but when I started doing the math and price shopping (and waiting in the queue) I decided it likely made the most sense to try and get a 6900xt.\n\nAnd to your point, for some crazy reason I have actually seen 6800xt's sell for more than 6900xt's in second hand markets, and considering I purchased a reference one barely used, for the cost of a new one with tax and shipping, it kinda proved my point.\n\nBut yes, the pricing is fucked and my concern is what the next gen of GPU's will be priced at. HOWEVER, I'm hoping there are either changes in ethereum or crypto in general that make the next gen less desirable, OR when they upgrade they flood the market with used 3090's and 6800's at ridiculously low prices in the next year. That could also force manufacturers to lower prices too once the miners get their fill. In late 2019 if you were patient you could find a Vega 64 for under 200 bucks, or a Radeon Vega FE for under 400, we will see that again.\n\nAnd for people worried about buying second hand, linus tech tips did a great video on how used GPU's rarely if ever under perform over their new variants. Especially the higher binned models as well!",

      "I think the prices are going to fall like stones when they finally are able to ramp up production.  I wanted a 6800 XT myself and waited a year for it--but finally settled on a 6700 XT (GB Eagle 6700 XT 12GB) when the NewEgg price dropped to where I thought the real non-shortages MSRP of an AIB card with a triple fan would be...about $100-$125 over AMD store reference design pricing--so I grabbed it.\n\nIt was kind of interesting that while I was completing the order, the Newegg stats said that there were 200 other people with the same GPU in their carts!  I can understand, since the price had dropped suddenly by almost $300.  Went back a couple of days ago and darned if the Newegg price of the same GPU hadn't been raised again another $200 over what I paid...;)  NewEgg must have received a big load of the Eagles and they priced them to sell quickly, which they did.  So, production is still not back to normal, unfortunately.  Let's hope things get back to normal soon.\n\nAnyway, I'm well pleased with this product!  GPU beats my 5700 XT at 4k convincingly, by up to 30-35% in most of my games!  And the image quality has definitely improved.  So, I'm pat on a GPU for a good while.  Next, I'll be looking at the 5700X/5800X or the 5800X-3dVcache!  I've got almost three years on my x570 Aorus Master and I can't see why it won't last another year or two...;)",
      "Those aren't at all close to the same concept. A 6900 XT is much more accessible than a Viper, which many theoretical buyers would have a disastrous time trying to drive. It's also much more bespoke (versus more mainstream Dodge vehicles of the time) than a 6900 XT. A 6800 XT is much closer to a 6900 XT than a Challenger is to a Viper.\n\nYou'd have a better chance at comparing AMD CPUs, putting a Ryzen 5 against a Threadripper Pro.",
      "It just depends on how important RT is to you, to be honest. Totally respect whatever decision people make, I run both AMD and Nvidia, and in many cases the 6900 can push as many frames as a 3090, there are cases where it outperforms because the 3090 has RT cores, whereas if you don't run RT, the 6900 has more dedicated cores meaning it can technically out perform a 3090 in certain use cases and especially if you're trying to push high frames.\n\nWith that said, buy what you want, and what makes you happy, makes no difference to me. JUST AVOID THE FUCK OUTTA SCALPERS AND SITES WITH TERRIBLE MSRP MARKUP!!!!!",

      "Odd. I started a game just to remind myself what my temps are like on my 240 rad - 1440p 60Hz running a 3D scene in War Thunder it spikes to 60 before the fans turn on but then holds at 49 with low fan RPM. At medium load (1440p Ultra 165Hz) it likes to hover around 53 and has never exceeded 61. PBO + 85 degree limit, OS power management features disabled.\n\nIf it's fine under load who cares I suppose. The mounting frames are a gimmick when it comes to AM5, although I belive they're valid for some Intel sockets.",
      "I have the same case and CPU, but with a 7900xtx. It breathes just fine. It has fans directly blowing into it. \n\nThe cpu gets a bit less coolong than normal, but this is fine since the wattage is so low on that chip. No issues what so ever. I think I use a NH-L12S or something similar.\n\nFor larger cards, like the 4080 or 4090, the fans for the gpu is removed to make space. In this case it is not a problem also, since it basicly is an open rig with no filter. Air is pulled right through.",

Inflation, shortages, R&D costs for the process technology, etc etc. People need to stop buying them at inflated prices in order for the prices to drop, and you cannot get enough people on board with that for that the happen.

If AMD ships the XTXH chip for all 6950 XTs it wouldn't be horrible since the premium Navi 21 cards are already more expensive than this.\n\n6750 XT at $549 is BAD, really really bad. %15 price pump would only be justified by a 15% or more increase in performance, which is highly unlikely by only adding faster memory and high clocks without core count change. At this price, the card is approaching the current 3060 Ti market price, the 6700 XT competitor. NVIDIA's feature set is superior and makes a 6750 XT at the same price look very dumb.\n\n6650 XT at $399 is fine I guess.

They thus use last-gen parts to service the lower-end market segments for 6-12 months. Recent examples include:\n\n* Ryzen 3000 desktop (Ryzen 2000 was lower-end))\n* Ryzen 5000 desktop (Ryzen 3000 was lower-end)\n* Ryzen 5000U (Zen 2 based APUs were lower-end, not Zen 3)\n* Ryzen 6000U (Zen 3 based APUs were lower-end, not Zen 3+)\n* Threadripper 3000 (TR 2000 and the 3950X were lower-end)\n* Radeon RX Vega series (RX 500 series was lower-end)\n* Radeon RX 5000 series (this didn't even have a top-end, and Vega and RX 500 filled in the gap until the 5600/5500 series)\n* Radeon RX 6000 series (gaps filled by RX 5000, Vega and RX 500, until the 6600 / 6500 XT launched)\n\nAMD aren't Intel; they have about a quarter of the manufacturing capacity, so aren't in a position to flood the market with SKUs top to bottom. AMD have, in fact, not done a top-to-bottom SKU launch on desktop within a launch window since maybe 2010 for CPUs (Phenom II) and 2015 for GPUs (RX 300 series). Every other launch since has either been top-heavy (e.g. Threadripper 3000) or bottom-heavy with no real flagship that can compete against Intel (e.g. 1800X and 2700X were still far slower than the i7-7700K and i7-8700K in gaming).\n\nExpect AMD's late 2022 GPU product stack to look something like this:\n\n* Titan-class prosumer card: \"Rage Fury RX Turbo\" with 2.5x the performance of the 6950 XT\n* Ultra-enthusiast: \"7990 XT\" - 2.2x the 6950 XT\n* High-end enthusiast: \"7900 XT\" - 2.0x the 6950 XT\n* Enthusiast: \"7900\" - 1.7x the 6950 XT\n* Lower enthusiast: \"7800 XT\" - 1.5x the 6950 XT\n* Upper mid: \"7800\" - 1.2x the 6950 XT\n* Mid-range: no 7700 XT at launch, just a cut-down 6950 XT\n* Lower-mid: no 7600 XT at launch, just the 6750 XT\n\nProblem is, all SKU tiers will move up in price. I'd expect the 6750 XT, for example, to be far more expensive than the 6600 XT despite filling the same relative performance tier.",

Major improvement to perf/watt once again.\n\nThe 6900XT is a less than 300W card. Efficiency improvements brought by the process and the architectural changes could bring it down to 200-225W. Put two of them together thanks to MCM, and you're at 400-450W, for 2x the perf. And finally add the RDNA3 improvements and you get a 2.2x or so monster of a GPU. Really not inconceivable, it's just that years of +5% yearly by intel and +30% every couple years by Nvidia made us believe we had reached some sort of wall. That was never the case, the issue was always the lack of incentive for any of these companies to really push the envelope. Now we have AMD delivering on both CPU and GPU sides and look, intel just dropped one of the biggest performance leap in CPU perf of the past 5 years. Of course that wasn't just because of AMD, these architectures take many years to develop but it's no coincidence such a big perf jump happens when they have to defend their marketshare.\n\nNvidia Lovelace is also rumored to be a giant leap (but not quite to the level of RDNA3 because of the lack of MCM)",

It does surprisingly well for the games that I play.  I'm not unhappy with it and I'm happy to have something that runs well with some settings turned down.  What I really don't love is that it sounds like a jet engine with almost any game running.  I did have some thermal paste that I re-applied to it, which helped a little, but it is just so loud still.\n\nMy previous card was a 5600xt that I bought to finally replace my workhorse - the 760 GTX.  I only used the 5600 for a short bit, though, as I built a budget system for my son but couldn't afford a decent video card (this was during \\~2020-21).  I installed my 5600xt in the system I gave him and I went back to the 760.  The 1060 was handed down from a friend.  All this to say that I have gotten used to lower settings :)\n\nI recently started looking at an upgrade and thought that the 7700xt looked like what I wanted - until I saw that the prices were pretty solid at $429+.  The 7600xt was my next choice.  I didn't love it at $329 but I have a gift card to microcenter to take it down to $280.  With tax that would be \\~$304.  Then I saw one that was open box for $280, which would be \\~$250 out the door.  I feel like that is a price I can afford and not a bad price for a 7600xt.  The cheapest out the door for a 7700xt would be \\~$412.  That's not something I can do right now.\n\nI have a 1080p monitor and have no plans to upgrade that in the near future.  I'm really just looking for constructive thoughts on whether I should move on the open box 7600xt or just hang onto the 1060 for now and see what else comes along.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\nedit:  Adding my \"out the door\" cost for different cards at Microcenter.  I added more thoughts to a comment below but I'm thinking that the 7600xt open box is my best option.  If not for that it would probably be the 7600 with some thought on the 4060.  I'm also thinking that I might keep watching and see if the 7700xt comes down at all - or maybe I find an open box to bring it down a bit.  Although maybe that is just overkill for what I use it for.\n\nAlso added the 6750xt.

The open box price is the only thing that makes the 7600xt more desirable.  Without that it is $50 more for a lot better performance.

I don’t know how these specific cards compare, but it’s something to consider. \n\nI run a 6950xt (Also Microcenter, $499 with cpu purchase a few months ago!). I was starting to regret the purchase due to driver issues, but I installed the AMD pro drivers and haven’t had any problems since. I mention this to say that I’ve turned ray tracing on in Hogwarts and Cyberpunk, and didn’t find the difference big enough justify spending $200 more on a Nvidia card. Just my two cents",

TBH its pathetic that in 2023 a 250-300 dollar card targets 1080p when thats what the rx480/1060 did at the same price point in 2016. By now 1080p high settings should be relegated to the 50/50ti class cards especially when you compare it against the experience a console provides at its price point.",
      "For the price difference that is cost of ONE game you can just get 6700xt and play 1440p reasonably well. I just dont get these new 1080p gpus.",

      "> So, the RDNA 2 CU -> RDNA 3 CU performance jump seems to be quite small\n\nYeah, iirc it was around 9% IPC improvement from the 6950XT to 7900XT/7900XTX when I did the math, so same clocks+same CU count would only put a card ~9% ahead, although 7600 is on 6nm rather than the 5nm of the 7900XT/7900XTX, so it *might* not even be as good of an improvement.",
      "200 in 2016 is equal to basically 250 in 2023. Inflation pays a part sure but mostly it’s Nvidia and to a slightly lesser degree AMD getting greedy.",
      "Soooo... the 6650XT is currently at 250 euros while this card costs 300 euros which is 20 euros more than the 6700 and 20 less than the 6700XT. I think that there is nothing more to add in regards to this pricing. Once it drops below 250 euros it will be a fine card, however if it had just a little bit more VRAM it would have been a good card below 250 euros.",
      "The A750 is $249 MSRP. AMD and Nvidia doing their best to increase Intel's market share.",
      "Maybe you want to stone me, but I believe that while 10 or 12 GB would have been nice, I think that für a 600 level card the 8gb should be fine. On the other hand I think that the 7700xt should have 16gb and the 7700 and 7600xt should have something in between. \n\nBut for the normal 7600 8 gb is ok in my opinion. The will probably be the cheapest card that AMS is going to sell and 8gb for the lowest entry is still fine.",

      "Reviews are today? Even then, a 29% performance increase versus the 6600 (if confirmed) means this is just a 6600XT/6650XT refresh sold as a non-XT card for pricing reasons.\n\n**Edit:** By the way, this is the GPU chip that was supposed to match the 6900 XT according to MLID? ROFL."

      "AMD wanted their own 4060 TIs...",
      "The reviews will shred this card to pieces, 4060 ti style. The 6700 xt is simply better.",
      "This or a used RX 6800 16GB which is 50% faster? Jesus Christ the choice is so difficult!",
      "Maybe AMD shouldn't overprice then. Reviewers shouldn't be expected to return to a 6 month old product because it costs $100 less now. If AMD wants favorable reviews, make it $100 cheaper from the start.",
      "It may make sense to overprice it if they're still trying to clear 6700 XT inventory. For the same money you either get last gen with better performance or current gen with worse performance.",
      "Even when they cut prices, it's after gritting their teeth and taking too long.\n\nThe 7900 XT came down it price, but it took 6 months or more. That was to get to a price it should have been at launch. How impressive is it when you get a price cut after 6 months, and it's to where you should have been to start? You're still overpriced, IMO.\n\nThe 7800 XT fits this issue. People talked up that the 7800 XT had value because it replicated 6800 XT performance for $500, while the 6800 XT was a $650 card. Thing it, it released 3 years after the 6800 XT, which was already being discounted into the $500 range.\n\nPeople need to tell AMD (and Nvidia) to keep taking these prices and shoving them up their butts. A $1,000 7900 XTX being $920 (8% off!) during Black Friday a year after release sucks. A 7800 XT being a 6800 XT copycat for the same price as a 6800 XT sucks.\n\nThe market is trying to impose a universal price hike, and consumers need to smack it down.",
      "So more expensive than the 6700 XT but 15% slower?   \nWhat a joke\n\nFor this level of performance even 299 would be stretching it. At 329 it's DOA. Keep in mind, this is literally almost half the performance of a 7800 XT.",
      "The 16GB 4060ti is $120 at a minimum more for a card that's less than 20% faster",
      "So worse than a rx 6700xt but it has more vram (for what exactly?).",
      "My point exactly",
      "This would be sweet at $250.. \n\nThese should be cheap to produce, \n\nBut 6700 and 7700 are always going to be breathing down the neck. 12gb is enough vram at this price performance level.\n\n6800 16gb exists with double the memory bandwidth..",
      "What a waste. AMD going Nvidia way, what a shame.",
      "Well yes, but they could've also not have launched it yet. \n\nUnless 6700xt stock is finally drying up",
      "Because 12GB is plenty for the power the 6700xt have. And the 7600xt will be 20-30% weaker\n\nEdit: Scratch that, its more likely 10-20% difference. [7600 test](https://youtu.be/Yhoj2kfk-x0?si=86GUrkhfcbk5CuGY&t=918)",
      "For the idiots who cry about VRAM quantities but actually know nothing about it.",
      "They aren't wondering, they know why. Nvidia has had a 70+% share of the market for like a decade now, far longer than AMD's \"milk em' while we still can\" pricing strategy. They tried everything and they just lost, every time, regardless of how good or bad their GPUs were. \n\nThey've given up because most gamers just don't care and will shuffle their priorities around in any way possible to justify buying the latest Nvidia XX60 again and again.",
      "When you say \"regardless of how good,\" which generation do you think AMD's GPUs had any business \"winning?\" Thinking back to the last several:\n\nPolaris: Decent offerings with good value, but sat around for WAY too long. Didn't really compete beyond the 1060, meaning the 1070 and 1080 families faced no real competition.\n\nVega: You got all of two products, which launched during a mining frenzy. The $400 Vega 56 and $500 Vega 64 were it, since the Vega Nano got canceled. The V64 was a 1080 competitor that came out a year after the 1080. Yeah, you had the Radeon VII at the end of the generation, but it was just repurposing workstation silicon instead of tossing it, and the $700 price tag made it a non-starter for what it brought.\n\nRX 5000: RDNA came out with a good set of cards, but the 2070 was where they stopped competing. It left the top of the market untouched, while also competing a year after Nvidia's stuff was already in people's computers. If you were the target of an RX 5000 product, you were already a target of RTX 2000 a year earlier.\n\nRX 6000: AMD had a pretty compelling product here. The biggest issue here (other than the hole dug by the previous generations' woes) was the overall market. Everything was being gobbled up, production was spotty, so there was no ground to gain. Whether it was from crazy demand or tight supply, having everything sell through immediately is going to favor whoever's production is higher.\n\nRX 7000: Again, AMD's not competing at the top of the market, is late to market, and is generally not putting products on the shelves. The 7000 family launched with only the 7900 family, and one of those cards (XT) was comically overpriced for what it was. They spent another full year waiting to release the 7700 Xt and 7800 XT, which didn't provide any value or fill a market that was already being taken care of (6800 XT performance for then-current 6800 XT pricing isn't sending anyone running to the stores).\n\nAMD's been spending a long time firing most of its bullets into its own feet. Where Ryzen launched as a competitive product with aggressive pricing, Radeon products are often a combination of late to market, as far behind in performance as they are ahead on price, and generally not offering anything noteworthy for the wait. Ryzen offered a breakthrough in consumer core count for relative bargain pricing, then caught up on performance while staying price competitive on most every level.\n\nAMD's got loads of progress to make, if it wants. It just seems that AMD doesn't consider consumer GPUs to be a significant market. Whether it's superior margins with datacenter, inferior engineering, or something else, GPUs are a market where AMD is failing itself."

Sure, it's basically the same as the 6650XT (which, when I bought mine 7 months ago for 280, is feeling  even more like an excellent purchase), but until the 6650XT is sold out, they couldn't exactly undercut themselves without also just lowering the price of the rest of the 6000 series.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat AMD should have done is simply not release the card until they've sold off their old inventory, but I think they feel pressured because Nvidia is releasing the 4060s and they want to get at least some press for released products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit:  Note it is very slightly better than the 6650XT, both in average performance and especially ray tracing and.. AV1 encode that I doubt many people will use.  If they're the same price, which they are, I'd get the 7600 if I was buying tomorrow.",

They made a ton of RDNA2 GPUs because of a huge demand which vanished over night.\n\nUntil those are sold there is very little reason to offer better value. Otherwise they will have to write down the old inventory. And writing down old inventory is a loss.\n\nCan't really blame them for it. And if you want the latest gen, worse case scenario overpaying $20 for a GPU is not the end of the world.",
      "It's a fantastic card if power consumption, size and heat are unimportant to you. The 6800XT is a better alternative and only slightly slower while consuming far less power. For the midrange a 6700 10Gb for 270 or 6700XT for a bit more are viable alternatives to these lackluster new cards. If you are on a tight budget the 6600 series and ARC 750 are the way to go since Intel has just dropped the price of a 750 to 200 dollars. Nvidia can spin as DLSS is not worth 100 or more dollars anyhow at this level of GPU. You need 60 fps or more for framge generation to make sense due to latency issues, especially in FPS type games.",

Even then, it beat the 1070 by 10-15%. The 2070 was a lot more lackluster, but still. This 4060ti is in spitting distance of the 3060ti overclocked - that’s pitiful. I can’t recall a generation having that issue.\n\nThe Turing era wasn’t *that* bad after the refreshes. The refreshes were super good 2070S, 2080S. During that time the 5700xt ans 5700 came out which were insanely good for the $ too.",

AMD WAS ahead, multiple times - hell, even the 6000 series was one of the most competitive generations around, AMD matched nVidia's flagship for 500$ less pretty much, and nowadays even beats it - but people still bought more nVidia GPUs.  \n\nIn fact, there's more 3050s on Steam than... literally every AMD GPU. Same for GTX 1070, 2070s, 1660, 3060 Ti, 1650, fucking 3070 LAPTOP GPUs. Most popular AMD GPU is the 580.

To have a uniform access to the entire addressing space you have to use the same modules for the entire vram. That means for a 192bit bus you have total of 192bit/32bit = 6 modules that can either be 1 or 2GB capacity so 6GB or 12GB total. For 128bit bus that is 4 or 8GB.

      "I'd say the 5700XT was not budget by design, but got put into the bargain bin by force of circumstance. The transistor count was close to that of a 1080ti and it was built on a then cutting-edge 7nm process. It was only the lack of performance that forced AMD to sell it at a lower price.\n\nA couple of years later I still kinda wonder whether that was down to shitty launch drivers as usual, as the 5700XT has FineWined and is now occasionally punching above the 1080ti in certain titles.",

You used to be able to get a budget card for $100, a decent lower midrange card for $200, a strong midrange card for $300, and $400-500 were top of the stack. And then you'd have these weirdo dual cards for like $700 which would be the absolute best. \n\nMarket these days is a joke. \n\nThings were fine until 2018 or so tbqh. Then it all went to hell.",
      "6600 is the best budget options today, it launched at $330 MSRP, and sold for $600+ during the pandemic/crypto times, pretty much until February this year it was still around $300. This is replacing it with a $30 lower MSRP. So MSRP to MSRP they are giving us 30% more performance or roughly an overclocked 6650XT for $30 less. \n\nWe can continue yelling at clouds how cards in this performance range should cost around $200-250, but that's just yelling at clouds, the market scape for 4 years now is pricing this kind of performance between $300-400 and nothing will change that, except nobody buying such cards and we know this wont happen.",

The 6600 non-XT had a $330 MSRP, but that was increased preemptively due to the Cryptofuckening. They might make this 250-280 then.",

I definitely wouldn't be buying a GPU with 8GB VRAM for much more than this personally, I can tell you that much for sure.\n\nEDIT: I really think my cutoff point is somewhere between $280-300, depending on performance, assuming ~6700XT at 1080p (because lets be real, 8GB VRAM isn't reliably going to be enough for any higher). Any more than that is just a hard pass if you ask me.\n\nIf performance is closer to 6700, then I really hope this $250 price is right.",

I sprang for the 7900xt because it's giving me the ability to comfortably play games at ultra and even ultra with RT still with comfortable 60, and even more with optimized settings. Where the 6800xt simply couldn't enable RT with decent frames. \n\nSo although I agree it's not a great buy especially not at msrp. You don't have to lie to make it worse.",

      "That's all?????\n\nHonestly I expect nothing interesting out of Navi 33. It'll almost definitely only offer 8Go of VRAM, and we're already seeing severe bottlenecking with that. Whatever extra performance it has over Navi 23 won't be meaningful enough to warrant a buy, I'll still advocate that an rx 6600 is the sweet spot for low budget, low power gaming, and for anything above that to reach into a higher VRAM buffer.\n\nEither Navi 32 starts showing its head, or I'm thinking AMD's having so many problems with RDNA that they can't even start responding to Nvidia at the present time. I mean really, the XTX, 5/6th of an XTX, and nothing for over six months? ROCm support still on release candidates? No Navi 32s? Come on, what's going on..."

      "That means 128-bit bus and Navi 33. So it is a 7600 on steroids (which is still fairly unimpressive). I was hoping for 192-bit bus and Navi 32, a cut-down 7700XT, but unfortunately that won't happen.",

Throw in 16GB of ~20Gbps GDDR6 VRAM (so that it's faster than the 128-bit 18Gbps of the RX7600) and voila: A GPU that sits right in-between the RX7600 and the RX7700XT.",

      "I don't think they will do 48 as that would be too close to the 7700XT. I'd lean more towards 40 CU and the 20Gbps memory config, otherwise AMD  risks cannibalizing the 7700XT sale numbers (which AFAIK are already bad enough).",
      "It has happened before. 3060 12 GB vs 3060 ti 8 GB. It's because of the bus width. 7700XT is 192-bit so it's either 12GB or 24 GB. With a 128-bit bus you either go 8 GB or 16 GB.",

It's fine for what I do now but I've been wanting an upgrade for 2 years and there's just nothing worth buying.\n\nIf I paid the same price I paid 5 years ago for a new GPU today, the card would be roughly 30% faster. After 5 years that's a joke of an improvement. If I want double the performance I'd have to pay 50% more, which is insane.\n\nIt's mostly a testament to how bad the 40 series and the 7000 series are, as they barely improved on the 6000 series and the 30 series."

      "> I really don't get the hate for this GPU\n\nOkay I'll break it down for you.\n\n> I once listened to all people saying that 4GB of VRAM is enough in midrange GPU instead of 6GB at that time. I regretted this as f*** when Horizen Zero Down whas struggling with that 4GB despite framerate being ok (for me, I'm casual gamer, I prefer better looks over 60+ fps).\n\nThats a fair point, you can play as you choose. But this card is really only good for 1080p gaming at maxxed out settings. At 1440p you will have to turn down settings. RT is basically not very good on a card like this. Thus at 1080p not many games will saturate 12GB of memory on alternative cards like an RX 6700 XT and other alternatives exist like a used RX 6800 which is not only faster but similarly priced with the same VRAM. So you're better off with one of those.\n\n> New gen will likely get better and longer support. Also in things like ROCm which is important for some people.\n\nSure but by the time the RX 6000 series is outdated you will have probably upgraded anyways. Think about the RX 480 and how much support it's received and to this day I would say it's not good enough for 1080p max settings gaming like it was back when it released in 2016. Point is, by the time support is an issue, its time for an upgrade anyway. ROCm is cool, but not much of a difference between 6000 series and 7000 series, unless you're looking at buying an R9 390 or older, it's pretty much a non issue.\n\n> 6700XT is more power hungry. If you are upgrading a few year old PC with 500-550W PSU, it's worth it instead of replacing PSU.\n\n[70W between a 6700 XT and a 7600, it's not much of a difference.](https://tpucdn.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-7600/images/power-gaming.png) If you're using an older PC with say a i5-2500 or something like that you're never going to exceed 550W. [i5-2500 draws 150W at most under heavy Prime95 load](https://tpucdn.com/review/intel-core-i5-2500k-gpu/images/power.gif). 230+150W, hmmm 380W. Not an issue at all versus 310W.\n\n> Pleeeeease don't compare this with 4060Ti 16G, it's completely different price range\n\nEveryone knows that card is absolute garbage in terms of pricing. Most people compared it to a 6700 XT or a used 6800 or a RX 6700.\n\n> I'll buy this GPU the day the launch tax is done or maybe even earlier beacause I was waiting exactly for this for like half a year.\n\nGood for you.",
      "A sign that most people looking at a good enough upgrade for 1080p (whose GPU budget is only $350 max) are literally in a conundrum, despite the ~5-10% uplift and a narrow 128-bit bus/uber-large VRAM (that may not see good use well outside of those with PCIE 3.0 boards) for such a GPU in its class.\n\nTo highlight this conundrum (regarding the 7600XT) I talk about:\n\n-Yeah the 16GB may be useless on this level of performance especially that narrow bus, however so is the 4060 Ti 16GB and AMD at least does not ask for $500 lmao. The latter is way faster but so is the 7700XT which may be out of your budget.\n\n-The 6700XT exists and is the better buy for this segment, but it's getting hard to find depending on your market. Where I live it's either not available or prices are stupid (7700XT is sometimes cheaper like literally). If the 7600XT's real world gaming performance is quite close to the former, then it's something to think about at least.\n\n-Some games literally eat >8GB even at 1080p med-high. This card may show relief for such titles if FH5 is any indication. Good for me that rocks BC7 compression 2K custom Fallout 4 textures.\n\n-Some people have PCIE 3.0 boards. That huge VRAM can stave off the ill effects of the GPU's x8 lanes on PCIE 3.0 systems. \n\n\n-Your other choices are either a 4060 non-Ti which is only 8GB or the 3060 12GB which is slower than 7600 non XT.  Choosing the very former is a no-brainer if it were not for this VRAM conundrum we're in. \n\nTLDR: (paraphrased from an Anadtech comment) It may offer a compelling 1080p performance for a possibly reasonable price, that also gets past the 8GB conundrum while possibly undercutting the 4060s.\n\nAll I can say is that I do hope the 7600XT's real world performance is what TechPowerUp's prediction it will have. I can just get that instead (if prices are good) as 6700XT where I live is hard to find. Good enough for me if that's the case. No plans to upgrade from 1080p anyway.",
      "So who's 'ahead' of Nvidia then if AMDs competition (Nvidia) is ahead of them and yet  started doing that kinda crap  first?",
      "Texture resolution is one of the most easily noticeable graphics setting you can change, and having enough VRAM to crank it to the max in the newest games can squeeze quite a bit of extra life out of a card. \n\nHaving a GPU with what today seems like a bit too much VRAM compared to the rest of the card's capabilities helps with this.",
      "AMD shouldnt have waited for CES to announce this, it shouldve come sooner and had a price drop for christmas sales. Launching it at CES at it's MSRP is a joke, its not competitive with anything.",
      "6750xt will still be much better than the 7600xt",
      "I play at 4k60 with it, mostly with a mix of high/ultra settings. I’m not playing the latest AAA, but I get great performance on CP2077 and Elden ring.",
      "What is there to announce?",
      "I play at 1440p with an RX580. It just obviously isn't current AAA games (nor esports). Sure I have to turn settings down, but whatever the 6700XT and 7600XT can produce at 1440p is leaps and bounds better than an RX580. I think it's a bit unfair to say people wouldn't consider these cards for a budget 1440p setup if they've already got a 1440p capable monitor.\n\nEdit: Assuming the price drops too a good spot",
      "It's significantly slower.",
      "I would understand FSR 3 vs DLSS 3. Fair enough. But AFMF is something activated at the driver level. A lot of users have no idea how to do it. Besides, the contribution of AFMF in gaming is still pretty questionable. I would say it is better to have it OFF then ON, but perhaps I am more latency sensitive than most.\n\n\nRegardless, AMD could still compare the 7600XT to the 4060 both cards running naked. Just pure native frames, the way it used to be.",
      ">the super cards are just pushing the stack up one tier then discontinuing the old stack.\n\nNot really sure what you mean by this. The Super cards are basically upgrading the stack while either keeping pricing the same or improving it which is a much better move than most expected from Nvidia.\n\n4070 Super and 4070Ti Super are both pretty compelling cards imo and I'm probably looking to upgrade to a 4070Ti Super in the next few months to play games maxed out at 1440p. 4080 Super is decent too but mostly because it finally dropped from the horrendous $1200 price point of the original 4080.\n\nOverall these cards make RTX 40 a much better option for the next year until RTX 50 launches and I can't fathom buying an RDNA3 card over these unless AMD greatly reduces prices (which they might but we'll have to wait and see)."

On one hand, $350 6 core processor. On the other hand, $350 might get you the best for gaming processor by like 10-30% depending on what games you play if the difference between the 7600X and theoretical 7600X3D is similar to the difference between the 5800X and 5800X3D.",

Now you might say, I don't care I'll upgrade my motherboard with my CPU in three, four, or maybe five years from now, but the point is, when performance and price are virtually identical, you have to look at other factors, and when doing so the fact is the 7600X is on a superior platform, it does consume less power, and it is easier to cool despite its love for the 95 degree TJ-max.

There is also 7900XT to 7800XT, $499 to $899, but there is at least 7900 GRE in that gap even if it isn’t widely available. I’m sure AMD WANTS to put something in that lower gap, but I’m not sure what that card is. A third tier Navi 32 is of course an option, but the confusing pricing of the 7700XT (and quite frankly, the stupid naming of the entire lineup) makes me think that they don’t want to price any of their chiplet designs any lower for whatever reason - more likely capacity than cost, but it could be either.\n\nFaster Navi 33 seems unlikely as the boost clock is already the highest in the lineup. Of course they could upgrade the VRAM clock to 20GHz effective, but that’s about it, and I don’t think Navi 33 is bottlenecking that hard on memory bandwidth anyway.",

      "No, there's two possible reasons for the 7800.\n\n1. Vram prices crashed hard just before the launch of the 7700xt. You can get 8gb of gddr6 for $25 pretty much and this happened around June 2023. With the lead time to a product launch, the August release of the 7700xt was likely planned prior to these prices collapsing.\n\n2. Yields of the dies are good enough AMD wants to up the CUs. It could also be AMD found 60 CUs at lower clocks is perfectly stable, so there's no need to cut down to 54 when they could sell 60 just at a lower clock speed.\n\nSo, there are at least two reasons I see for this that make sense."

I say that as someone who had a 3080 paired with a 5800x and got some really big gains in some cpu heavy game when I upgraded to a 7800x3d. Cyberpunk went from 65 to 100fps in dog town as an example.

      "If the two only positive/best things that can be said about your GPU is that you'll stop producing the other better ones to increase margins, and that it'll come crashing down in price soon enough... Well, you're probably AMD. Then again there's nothing positive to say about Nvidia's except the 4090 is a huge leap... When's intel dropping some new hotties?\n\nAnyone in this price tier should either grab a 6700 10 GB while they still exist, or go used. I got a 6700 xt for 220 with 2 years warranty left a couple days ago. And sales tax here is 15% so even more savings there. Receipt price is 1265 from the scalpocalypse... Oof.",
      "I think it’s aimed at new buyers on a budget or people who skipped a gen or two who are also on a budget.",
      "This. I know it's a poor gen on gen upgrade, it's quite a boring GPU for guys like us but if you already own a 6600/xt/50xt you don't really need an upgrade. \n\nNew people building PCs in a few months will appreciate the 7600. People still on a RX 580 or GTX 1060 who finally decide to upgrade, it's good for them.",
      "I doubt you will ever find a card to buy, with that expectation.",
      "27% faster than the 6600 is a decent gen-on-gen upgrade, *especially* for this market segment.",
      "it's not (just) about margins, it's about getting rid of old stock",
      "4060ti was dunked on by majority of reviewers. What",
      "It's 100€ more my man, I'm not spending that money.\n\nEDIT: proof, before I get any shit for this. https://amzn.eu/d/fs9LMWP",
      "In the used market he very easily can",
      "Usually new gen offers better value than old gen even if it's on its way out. At least if it's interesting. To get better value on a 2080 ti than a 3070, you had to buy used. 980 ti was also terrible value when 1080 ti was launching same for 780 and 980, etc. Otherwise why launch it? Just keep giving us rdna 2 if it's better value. It's not like there's new tech even on offer. Like how is your launch supposed to be exciting if all it's making me wanna do is buy your older stuff?\n\nAnd what's worse is 6650 xt's have been available around this price for like 6-12 months. So who's this card for? Anyone who wanted this type of performance at this type of price could've had it for the last year and been gaming away. It would've been substantially better value, if you buy it now it's more of a giving in \"ughhhh fine\" than exciting.",
      "The used market has its own drawbacks.\n\nDue to AMD's aggressive new pricing, I don't find used RDNA2 cards to be worth it tbh. The price is slightly lower than new, but you still have to pay sales tax and likely much more for shipping.\n\nFor example, after shipping the *cheapest* BIN 6600 on eBay is 160, when you can get a brand new one with a game and free shipping for 180.\n\nHWS is an option, but imo any legitimately good deal gets purchased so quickly that you pretty much have to F5 to actually get anything. And Facebook Marketplace is complete fucking garbage frankly and a huge PITA in my experience.\n\nYou could buy a gen older used, but that has its own clear disadvantages too.",
      "The more you buy, the more you save😎",
      "I honestly think that the 7600 is an impressive step forward for a card that performs quite a bit better than the 6600 and 6600xt. \n\nFor the price you are paying for, along with more modernized core architecture, its a good buy. And as per always, AMD normally makes their cards very competitive as time goes on with better drivers altogwther.",
      "Yeah, tbh I dislike how AMD is getting flack for properly clearancing their products instead of artificially holding last gen pricing up and delaying next-gen until they're 98% gone.\n\nOlder cards have always been the better deal because GPU makers need to get rid of them. As they are more expensive to make than newer ones for the same performance tier and use more power. So they kind of have to be the better deal in the current market or they'll never be able to sell them.\n\nWas the 1070 a bad card because the 980 TI was clearanced under 400? I think Nvidia *not* clearancing Ampere pricing for so long really screwed with people's memory.",
      "Reviewers yes, we'll see what consumers think.",
      "After seeing the 7600's price/performance I just bit the bullet and bought an RX 6600 for 206€  \n\n\nWill keep it for as long as I can, next purchase will probably be with an entirely new build.",
      "under $200 is where this card will shine, 8GB above 200 is just a stupid purchase.",

      "To name a few. The cards are underperforming, judging by AMD's slides. There's a reason they haven't announced the rest of their lineup, something isn't working quite right with RDNA 3. It should have much more performance than it has now. \n\nHeard VR performance isn't very good on the 7000 series, not sure if those have been fixed yet.\n\nThe 7900XT should've launched as the 7800XT for a much lower MSRP, due to its relatively poor performance uplift. It's incredibly overpriced, judging by how many times the price has been cut on it.\n\nThe 7900XT also caused a weird situation where they can't really launch their actual 7800XT and not make it look terrible in performance or price compared to their discounted RDNA 2 cards. Basically the performance of the 7900XT is on par with what the 7800XT should've been.",
      "I remember him saying AMD will get a minimum of 2x 6900XT performance, upto 2.2x and Nvidia was in alot of trouble. \n\nSomething went wrong with Navi31, hopefully a refresh will fix it otherwise the GPU market is looking dead for another 2 years until next gen.",
      "Meh. I want N32. Where is that?",
      "So what does it bring to the table that isn't on RDNA2? AV1 that 99% of people will never use?\n\nThey screwed up. Period. It's put them in a tight bind on placing the rest of the RDNA3 SKUs because they are competing directly with their OWN products and there are no features/ incentives to get it over a similarly priced and likely better performing RDNA2 card.\n\nBy the time this actually hits the shelves, prices will likely have dropped even more on current GPUs.",

He has enough knowledge of hardware that he can throw out some belieavable shit and spin them as leaks. He works on the moto of \"if i throw enough shit at the wall something will stick\" and \"even a broken clock is right twice a day\".\n\nAnd when he is wrong he just backtracks or tries to delete all evidence of being wrong.",
      "7600 XT coming out soon with no N32 cards on the horizon, it does make me wonder if AMD might not just skip the N32 DIE for desktop completely and move on from RDNA3 as soon as they can.\n\nIf we are being realistic, RDNA3 doesn't really bring anything new to the table that would warrant paying more for it if you don't need AV1. So anyone looking for value, will buy a discounted RDNA2 card, for everyone else who wants RT and FrameGen, they will grab something from Nvidia at a premium price.\n\nThen we see a number of reports that 4070s are not selling very well, with cards dropping below MSRP in some regions, with Microcenter in the US even offering $100 Steam Gift Cards On All NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Purchases.\n\nAMD might decide it's not worth it, push out the 6 class cards asap and call it a day while continuing to sell the discounted RDNA2 stock. Even this 7600XT is going to be a hard sell against discounted RDNA2 cards, $299 MSRP might make it worth a look but it's not exciting in the least.",
      "Honestly as an AMD fanboy, I thought the 4070 looked decent. Basically low power consumption 3080 with all the lovelace features for $600. It's just there are many alternatives at that price point (even the PS5); you might find the 6950xt for $600 which is an alternative. There is no real advantage in RDNA3 over RDNA2 besides performance, so you're not gonna miss out much imo.",
      "Seems to me AMD is eager to move on from RDNA3 and they're just trying to get out what they can for some sales in the mean time. So many issues with this generation.",
      "It won't be, but it ought to be less than that given you only get 2/3rds the VRAM of a 6700xt as well.\n\nBetween that and the fact that that performance for $300 is old news, this thing should be like $229.",
      "Give it a few months and it probably is at $350",
      "I disagree. The 4070 is only a decent option because if the price being somewhat close to reasonable. (Especially with the Microcenter $100 steam card promo). When you bump it up to $800, 12GB of vram is absolutely unacceptable. That’s the type of card you would be trying to use ray tracing with, which will just make the vram issue even worse. \n\nI would step up to a 4080 before I would consider a 4070ti. At least then I can do the extra things I can’t do on a 4070 for more than a year.",
      "they literally hired new people to run it and scaled down their designs to a conventional gpu to make enterprise customers happy, meaning they have customers for once in their lives.\n\napparently they have to walk to your door and beat you senseless with a gpu shroud before you stop coping."

Nvidia is still dominating market share by almost 9:1.\n\nPricing to market maintains the status quo. If they want to gain market share they need to be as aggressive as possible.\n\nObviously they still need to profit. Nobody anywhere has ever suggested they sell cards at a loss.",

On top of that, AMD's now jacking up pricing in a manner similar to Nvidia, but using features that aren't good enough to justify it. They haven't delivered on FSR 3. Their RT performance is inferior. They're losing on efficiency.\n\nWhen AMD's pricing is better value than Nvidia, but worse than last-gen products from AMD currently on store shelves, what's the selling point? When AMD starts using \"the new features are great\" to promote their products that are worse than Nvidia at those things, in the hopes they'll justify their pricing model that sucks, they just make themselves look bad.\n\nFrom one side of their mouths, AMD and their supporters are talking up \"as good at Nvidia at raster,\" while using the other sides of their mouths to tell us RX 7000 is worthwhile over RX 6000 because of new features. They lose at both ends.",

After they run out of RDNA2 stock, then AMD can drop the prices on those cards, and trap Nvidia with nothing viable in the $200-$400 range and a ton of RTX 3000 cards rotting on the shelves, it'll be a brilliant move, if true.",
      "\"It's not a fucking charity,\" is a terrible counterpoint. No one's asking them to lose money on cards or give them away for free. AMD's also sitting at a marketshare that's lower than necessary because they keep pushing people to Nvidia with a mix of rising prices, delayed/buggy features, lesser performance, and slow releases.\n\nThis isn't AMD matching/overtaking Intel with Ryzen. They're still floundering from miles behind Nvidia without a path to significant marketshare with products that could earn it. People aren't running around saying \"I want a free card,\" they're saying they'd buy AMD's stuff if AMD were reasonable.\n\nWith as bad as the RX 7000 release has been (7900 XT was too expensive, 7800 XT took too long, both apply to the 7700 XT), I've been sitting on my 5700 XT for basically 2 years longer than I intended. Between friends and relatives, there are probably 10 different PCs that I'd normally have upgraded or helped people upgrade, but I just haven't because the products aren't good enough, and I'm confident that I'm not alone.\n\nIf they released the 7800 XT 6+ months ago, I'd have bought one. Now, I'm fine to wait until Black Friday to evaluate the 7900 family's pricing because buying a 7800 XT that performans like a 6800 XT for the price of a 6800 XT isn't appealing.\n\nPlenty of us here arguging against AMD's pricing are interested consumers. AMD's losing business from it, and it's not like they're gaining on Nvidia in spite of us.",
      "A cut-down version of Navi 32 with 10GB would imply a memory bus of 160bit, which I see a bit strange as every MCD sports a 64bit memory bus.\n\nA 12GB card would use 3 MCDs, being the 4th disabled (probably was already defective), but a 10GB would use 2MCDs and half of the 3rd one. For me, it sounds very strange.\n\nI would not be surprised if they are rebrands of the 6700 10GB and 6700XT 12GB. They also fill the performance gap.",
      "This must be on N32, since N33 cann't suport 10GB at all (unless we have a GTX970 situation) and would only support 12GB with either 24Gbit modules or the cursed clamshell option of 16Gbit+8Gbit.\n\nSlotting these in at 40 and 48CU for the 10 and 12GB respectively would fill out the mainstream lineup, but they shouldn't both be the 7600XT. We got mad at Nvidia over the 4080s, and I don't think we should accept it from anybody else either. 48CU/12GB needs to either be a 7650XT or the RX7700 for the naming scheme to hold up imo."

      ">For RX 6700 XT, AMD may opt for the Navi 32 with a reduced core count.\n\nOr it could just be Navi 33 with faster clocks or memory.\n\nIf it's a cut down Navi 32, there's a big space between the RX 7600 and the 7700XT. Halfway it would be around 6700 XT up to 4060 Ti levels of performance. That would be alright around $300, but it's going to be $349 plus, right?",

      "The 7600 is on 6nm, which tolerates 1.2V pretty much indefinitely, but the 7600 per TPU only averaged ~1V, faster 2GB G6 exists, clamshell is doable for 16GB total, and TPU got a 10% OC even with artificially limited headroom, so I bet a 7600XT is about 15% faster at stock.",

If 6700 XT was out of stock right now would you be happier? I feel like your issue is that there's a discounted old cards still lying around.",
      "> Or it could just be Navi 33 with faster clocks or memory.\n\nFaster memory yes - they could probably go with 20 GHz GDDR6 - but higher core clock is a maybe. 7600 already has the highest core clock of any RDNA3 card. There is a chance that they can go a little higher, as 6500XT (on the same 6nm process) runs 160 MHz faster (boost). That’s 6% faster than 7600 - a fairly small gap - and the card will probably draw 200W if you do that. Doesn’t seem worth it to me?",

They probably could have only made the 7800 XT and the few chips that need to be cut down could have been a China or laptop exclusive.\n\nI don't see how an even more cut down N32 GPU would make any sense. If they launch a 7600 XT, I find it more likely it'd be an overclocked RX 7600 with 16GB of faster VRAM instead.\n\nDrop the 7600 to like $239 and launch the 7600 XT with 10-15% better performance and 16GB VRAM for $299. Something like that.",

Releasing an 8GB card at a price range above the 7600 in this day and age would be a mistake, given the 7600 itself has borderline the minimum VRAM you could ask for. Whatever comes above the 7600 needs to feature 12+ GB of memory to be a selling point against Nvidia's competing products.\n\n\nAs for the 7600 (non-XT), it was released 7 months ago. Things were slightly different back then, though it still was viewed as a bad product, given it offered very little offer the existing 6600/6600XT/6650XT.",

But the performance uplift between the XT and non-XT is just under 10% (depends on which reviewer you're citing, but on average I've checked, and it's about a 10% uplift in some games). So pay 22% more for only a 10% uplift? Hmm, if it were priced at $300, then you basically break even.",

We are talking about the 5700xt, a 2019 release and the 1080ti, a 2017 release, being similar in rasterization to a Rx 7600 non xt. RT on ANY of these cards is kinda irrelevant, it sucks enough you won't use it.\n\nIf you remember, back in 2018 the outgoing Gtx 1080ti cards were getting fire saled for $450. If you bought a 1080ti at that time and kept it because \"the Rtx 2000 series is overpriced\" you'd have survived the mining craze, made thousands of dollars during the mining craze with that card, and still in 2023 have a card that competes with brand new cards costing $250+. Like, that's how BAD this value proposition is.\n\nEven if you bought a 5700xt at $450 at launch in 2019... well you'd have a Rx 6700xt right now because miners were trading new 6700xt cards for used 5700xt cards because the 5700xt was one of the best mining GPUs per watt.",

AM5 requires significantly stronger power delivery, bios capacity, and DDR5, all of which cost more.\n\nThere IS no 'equivalent' AM4 board.  There are none with similar power delivery either.    AM5 has SVI3,  AM4 has SVI2.   This means different power ICs and mosfets -- and these are not yet high enough volume to bring prices down.  (once Zen4 Epyc is ramped up and these have greater supply, it will lower costs quite a bit for AM5).  So you can't compare the # of phases of some AM4 board to an AM5 one and declare them the 'same'.  \n\nAre mobo manufacturers trying to take a larger cut?   Probably.   But there is competition, and when prices don't lower while there is sufficient competition, the reason must be either supply constraints or higher costs.\n\nIts a little of both here:  higher costs for DDR5 mobo traces/layers, higher costs for various power delivery components, and related supply issues for power ICs for those (that essentially keep costs higher).",

But of course both the entry-level Intel and AMD may lack PCIe 5 support, or only have it on NVMe, or other weird bullshit.\n\n(PS: it's easier to just select Socket: LGA1700 unless you want to filter for specific chipsets! ;)\n\nNow of course... does that really matter to users?  DDR4 is still very competitive in gaming and if it allows you to go with a cheaper CPU and a cheaper motherboard maybe that's not an awful decision for losing 5% here and there.  13600K is a very competitive CPU for the price, so is 5800X3D, and if you have memory already and maybe a motherboard then AM5 still looks like an overall bad deal even if \"it's got DDR5\".\n\nAnd Zen4's memory controller is *really fucking bad*, like it probably won't POST with 4 sticks unless they're single-rank and low-speed.  [wendell talks about it here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P58VqVvDjxo) but it's not really limited to 128GB, it's any dual-rank sticks, and even a lot of single-rank sticks don't do great with 4 slots, and you are going to significantly reduce available bandwidth (from 70GB/s with 2 sticks down to about 50GB/s - this is not insignificant). You are basically buying the ddr5 equivalent of the early super finicky b350 boards.\n\nHUB being HUB of course they completely shat on DDR5 for a year straight when it was Intel-exclusive, it *just isn't ready yet guys*, meaning AMD hadn't launched theirs yet, but the moment AM5 launched that was the moment DDR5 was ready and you were a big moron if you were still buying DDR4.  Truth be told it still is not ready yet, things haven't changed from july or august really other than AMD having their product out now (and it's much worse than Intel in terms of memory controller).  The launch gouging was winding down within a couple months, decent RAM came out within a couple months, but the AMD platform just isn't there yet.  \n\nWe will see what prices do in the future, AMD is supposedly designing their platform around smart power stages, which drives up the cost relative to AM4 (and LGA1700), and AMD is intent on selling you 2 chipsets even if they aren't needed (de facto this is just moneygrubbing from AMD - nobody actually connects more than 3 pcie slots even on a $1300 board, nobody really needs the expansion from the second chipset, it's just a way for AMD to capture a little more revenue selling you something that's hardly even used).  Prices may not come down as much as people are hoping, and when AMD says \"cheaper boards are coming\" what they most likely mean is A620, ie even shittier and worse boards, not so much that decent B650/X670 boards are going to come way down.\n\nEven as someone who is really into the idea of a AVX-512 + v-cache system, I'm really dubious about that memory controller and I think it's probably better to just wait a year and see what happens.  I expect 8000 series chips and better motherboards and lower prices will fix most of the complaints.",
      "The problem is the mobos were massively overbuilt since stock power usage went up so much. Even entry level.",
      "I believe this is because they wanted to compare 32GB vs 32GB.",
      "No. Prices are basically the same from B660 and Z690 MSRP to B760 and Z790 MSRP. The pricing difference is mostly because 600 series is 'old' and thus is on sale now, despite being 95% as good. You can find more 700 series boards under $200 than you can AM5 board.",
      "That's fair enough but I also think it's also just priced really high by the motherboard manufacturers. For instance my $350 Asus Prime Pro doesn't come with a full mobo backplate. For $350, it most definitely should.",
      "meh, still no $110-$125 B650 atx boards + $150 2x16 6000 C30-36-36-89 DDR5 kits = NO BUY"

      "According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",
      "So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously",
      "The overhead is minimal for both AMD GPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, which is probably why reviewers didn't look at the overhead until Intel GPUs came along.",
      "We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.\n\nMy current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.\n\nPlaying off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",
      "> Unless you're running a CPU that's many many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about. \n\nThat's just not true with Battlemage.\n\nCPUs released in 2024 showed the issue in testing.  \n\nIt's not year of release, it's capabilities.",
      "It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.\n\nAlchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.\n\nAMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",
      "No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.\n\nThe main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",
      "On an older post an Intel graphics engineer explained the issue, it isn't what you said. Intel is too verbose in commands which slows everything down.",
      "I’m pretty sure HUB doesn’t like Nvidia *or* AMD. They’re calling it how it is, these parts are too damn expensive.",
      "One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.",
      "HUB used DX12 games that also showed the issue.  It's something else.",
      "I'm fairly sure they use dxvk for d3d9 to 11.",
      "The comment to which I am replying is talking about nVidia, not Intel.",
      "Glad you brought up Nvidia as I didn’t know this had improved until the testing around Arc showed it had gone.",
      "That's actually... just worse news.",
      "So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??\n\nMight as well get a faster GPU.",
      "Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.",
      "Could just be a cache issue",
      "Battlemage drivers use the cpu for software accelerating certain processes that are not being hardware accelerated in the GPU.",
      "Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs"

Why not try to be the definite value brand for 1 or 2 generations, and try to grab a huge chunck of marketshare first? No, first overprice the products, then drop soon after when it's too late. I truely don't get what they're doing.",

      "At this point, Nvidia's pricing is a really strange game of attrition.

      "Comparing and recommending to buy previous gen cards doesn't work as well for reviews because the 6700 will be long out of production before the 7600 is. Keeping things comparable within the same generation of cards for review purposes gives the videos better longevity. That's also why comparisons generally use MSRP instead of current market prices.",
      "They tried this is the past and all it resulted in was a 50/50 marketshare with Nvidia, but AMD made fuck all money whilst Nvidia made so much money that they barely knew what to do with it. AMD learnt from that to not challenge Nvidia on price/perf too much because it simply isn't worth it.",
      "The new paradigm is that older generations anchor the performance price points while the newer generations offer more performance at newer, higher price points.\n\n\nIt's basically what Jensen alluded to when he said the days of GPUs getting cheaper is over.

One can hope intel competition would do this, but call me a pessimist, I have a feeling intel will be right there besides them in a couple years.",
      "In a few process upgrades, they'll need microscopes and extra fine tweezers to handle the GPU dies for the lower end graphics cards.",
      "why would anyone ever choose this over 6700xt?",
      "Holy shit this card is even worse than imagined…",
      "> For example I expected the 7600 to rival the 6700xt for small price cut. Is that unrealistic ?\n\nthe question is \"small price cut\" versus what?\n\nif it's versus MSRP... the problem is a lot of these cards have incredibly distorted MSRPs because they launched into the pandemic/mining.  6700XT is a $480 MSRP card, which was acknowledged to be trash at launch, same for 3070 Ti and so on.  But if AMD/NVIDIA didn't charge a higher MSRP, scalpers would do it for them.\n\nI think a lot of people *think* it should be vs street prices, but RDNA2 prices are currently in an extreme firesale.  And despite a lot of confabulation/false recollection beating firesale prices is not really the norm.  Firesales are firesales, they're intended to get you to take the older crappier thing at a better perf/$ vs the newer, more efficient, more featureful one.  980 Ti for example was cleared out way way below 1070 MSRP, and Pascal is literally held up as the model generation for pricing.  780 Ti was cleared out at $180 or so after GTX 970 came out (I bought two for our machines), and at launch the 780 Ti was a faster card.\n\nAnd paradoxically this discourages firesales because reviewers just go \"buy a 1080 Ti\" instead of a 2070.  Why have firesales if they're just going to get you blasted in reviews?  That's why NVIDIA hasn't done it since Pascal - reviewers shit on them because of the firesales (from their perspective) so \"no more firesales\" is an easy (and profitable) way to make your reviews better.\n\nAMD is, for the first time, having their own \"Turing moment\" where their older RDNA2 cards are on extreme firesale and the RDNA3 cards are not that appealing in comparison, they just didn't make a very good advancement and there isn't a lot of visible perf/$ progression.\n\nAnd again, just like with Turing, and just like with the demands for Ampere overproduction/etc... people can pitch a fit all they want, it's not going to lead to the outcome people want, it's going to backfire on you.\n\nTo me the street price comparison in the days leading up to launch is completely pointless.  What we really need is a more sophisticated handling of whether MSRP was any good for the comparison points.  3060 Ti - really good MSRP, never available.  6700XT - terrible MSRP, way better street prices that are very available.  How do you compare that?  I think you need to set a baseline, like \"3070 for $500 is an average-tier product for last gen\" and make comparisons on both old+new products against that.  Because very obviously some of the MSRPs are trash and others were amazing yet completely fictitious.  But this is *completely* a judgement call and there is no objective way to do this.  And much like reviewers just don't wanna touch image quality anymore (unlike in the old days of FX vs Radeon, etc) it's much easier to just put out a \"product bad\" review.  I'm not saying it's great, but expecting it to beat intense firesale street prices is a little unrealistic - just like 2070 vs 1080 Ti was.  \n\nThis will get me in trouble but:  Turing wasn't *that* bad a launch, but, it had to go up against intense firesales from the second great mining boom and it was just not up to the task of beating 1080 Tis selling at half MSRP.  So NVIDIA decided to never let cards sell for half MSRP again.  Is that what people want AMD to do?  That's a real easy call for them to make.\n\nPeople are really upset because they feel like they've been sitting patiently and waiting for three years and they're *still *getting screwed.*  But the RDNA2 prices *are* the benefit here, those are really good prices and even matching them from a new product generation is great, generally you will not get to double-dip hugely on top of firesales.",
      "Hard to make profit if suddenly no one buys their gpus anymore, long term grabbing market share would make more sense imo.",
      "It’s better longevity but you lose the real ‘on the ground’ aspect of it. It also gets difficult when,  for one reason or another, MRSP doesn’t really exist (2080ti, 6000 series, 3000 series, etc). \n\nI’d much rather have Hardware Unboxed’s style of reviewing. Especially when they do updates and genuinely do look at regional pricing then rank performance off of that.\n\nIt muddies the waters by making it more complicated, but I really appreciate that sort of thing. These cards are meant to replace the old, and seeing how they stack up (currently) against them is important imo.\n\nI see your point 100% though",
      "Exactly. The 6600 vs 3050 is the perfect example. I knew people bought 3050s but even then I was surprised to see 5x more people own 3050s than 6600s in Steam's hardware charts. Oh, and reviewers also shat on that card."

    "selftext": "[https://wccftech.com/rgt-radeon-rx-7800-xt-rx-7700-xt-rx-7600-xt-and-rx-7600-gpu-performance-targets-and-specs/](https://wccftech.com/rgt-radeon-rx-7800-xt-rx-7700-xt-rx-7600-xt-and-rx-7600-gpu-performance-targets-and-specs/)\n\nHonestly, those specs don't inspire confidence in team Red for me this go 'round if they're true. The 7800XT is seeing maybe a 25 -30% bump in performance in best case scenarios with better RT performance, and the 7700XT is probably seeing similar results, but when compared to their last gen-counterparts the 7700XT is probably looking more like a re-badged 6800 possibly XT, and the 7800XT is basically a re-badged 6950XT with better RT performance.\n\nThe only card in there that's worth noting is the 7800XT, it'll be almost comparable to a 4070Ti, which I just upgraded from 6700XT to. The 7700XT looks like it'll fall victim to the same fate as the 6700XT, priced in no-man's land with middling performance.\n\nI was talking to some friends earlier about this--for the 7800XT to even succeed it has to be priced \"realistically\" no higher than $650-$700 only because Nvidia is the go-to for a lot of gamers, AMD has a lot of ground to cover, and despite what some might say, Frame Generation is probably the best feature I've seen on a GPU in a long time; that and DLSS support sold me on switching sides for this gen. DLSS has been one of the features keeping Nvidia on top these past few gens, even against comparable AMD cards, and FSR just hasn't had the impact DLSS had, even being open source, the adoption rate and IQ combined versus DLSS has put it way behind.\n\nIt pains me to see how the x700 series being given the treatment it's getting. The 5700XT was such a great card, and the 6700XT improved upon it, but marginally, but still offered performance relative to a 2080Ti. The fact that the 7700XT might not even hit 6800XT levels of performance means this card is going to have to be realistically priced at $400-$450 for it to succeed, otherwise they're just handing Nvidia a victory this generation. The 4070, it's competition is going to be utilizing DLSS 3, and frame generation which is, in the eyes of the average consumer who doesn't understand tech but can read numbers is going to gravitate towards. The only thing that would push people to the 7700XT is if the 4070 is priced outrageously. Even then if Nvidia releases a 4060/Ti, it's probably going to eat the 7700XT's lunch in terms of sales.\n\nThe 7600XT is literally just a rebadge, plain and simple. Nothing to see here. :(\n\nSorry for the long post, but honestly the only card that piqued my interest from this gen would have been the 7700XT, but after pulling the trigger prematurely and getting the 4070Ti, honestly I'm happy I did. As much as it pains me to stray from team Red after six years,but I wanted something that was a step up from mid-range that would give me the option to play in 4k without spending over $1000, and I got the 4070Ti for $900 after sales taxes, which isn't bad for basically 3090Ti levels of performance, and about $132 less than what I would have gotten a sapphire/power color 7900XT. Was it pricey? Hell yes, but with it's performance level I'm easily seeing a good 3-4 years of usage from it, namely at 1440p.\n\nIt should be telling that the 4070Ti, despite it's price, is a card that AMD is going to have a tough time competing with considering it's nearest competitor, the 7900XT is only marginally better for $100-$150 more, and with the prices of the 7700/7800XT being unknown, AMD's got their hands full trying to figure a price that'll entice buyers. That's of course if these rumors are true.\n\nWhat do you guys think? You think AMD is on track, or do you think they blew their load a bit prematurely and forgot about the lower echelon of the RDNA3 cards?\n\nEdit: To clarify I was hoping and praying for AMD to pull a sucker punch on Nvidia and catch them off-guard to bring balance to the GPU market. I'm still hoping they do, or at least sell well, I would love to see AMD continue the trend of keeping Nvidia's pricing somewhat in check and maintaining decent performance, otherwise spending $900 on what can be viewed as mid-range will be nothing but a pipe dream in the years to come. I'm an AMD guy at the end of the day, even when the i7-2600k was god-tier I opted for AMD. ",

      "AMD picked the wrong generation to invent the XTX SKU, because they can only really compete with Nvidia's (current) second-best. And that's ignoring the looming Ada Titan/4090 Ti.\n\nRemember when Navi 1 released? The highest model was the 5**7**00 XT, which was a clear indicator that it competed with the 20**7**0 (Super).\n\nLikewise, the 6**9**00 XT at least had a claim to fighting the 30**9**0 when it came to 1080p and 1440p without RT.\n\nBut the 7**9**00 XTX is only a match for the RTX 40**8**0 (which is significantly gimped compared to the 4090), and the RX 7**9**00 is hardly a match for the 40**7**0 **Ti**. Keep in mind that the RX 6**8**00 competed with the 30**7**0 **Ti**. I have no doubt that a 4080 Ti is coming as well.\n\nIt's clear that all RX 7000 products below the 7900 XTX are more gimped versions than they would have been, had AMD decided not to name that SKU as such. Navi 32 and 33 not having more Compute Units than their predecessors (like N31) combined with the name-fuckery means that AMD will have to offset core reductions on low & mid-range products with clock increases to try to have barely-not-stagnant performance. Truly a pathetic showing this generation. I hope for everyone's sake that most people outright reject these.",

      "What were you expecting them to be?\n\nI think performance estimates are too high, though. The 7900xt had 25% more bandwidth, and 20% more boost clock compute even after the clock bumps. We're probably talking 6900xt performance on average, with better RT and machine learning. Still behind the 4070ti in every way except VRAM.\n\nI guess people were expecting another  navi31 cut, maybe? 72 CU or something?",
      "AMD is not innovating and is just happy to ride NVIDIA's coattails  while only getting money largely from their fanboys",
      "I think all these specs would have been great had AMD achieved the performance targets. Remember NVIDIA actually decreased CU's for cards compared to previous generation. But the performance uplift was so good that the cards still delivered better performance compared to cards with more CU's across the lineup.\n\nAMD didn't have much IPC gains or clock speeds and hence the 7000 series look lackluster in comparison.",
      "AMD is going to have to be VERY competitive with their pricing if they want to move these cards at all especially with the lack of frame generation. Most people without this feature will quickly discredit it and write it off but with my hands on experience it's a game changer.",
      "We're in-line to see maybe a tops 25-30% boost to the 7700XT which is inline with the 6700XT over the 5700XT. Problem that I have is having to upgrade sooner than later. It's almost as if the x700 line of cards are designed to be replaced every gen. They don't leave much headroom for newer games/graphical features when it comes to performance, almost as if they're designed around games that were released the year prior. \n\nI just couldn't bring myself to get excited for the 7xxx series GPU's. I was hyped at first, especially for the 7700XT, but I got hit with what will be ultimately a letdown and a reality check about AMD's mid-range left me wondering when will AMD start offering more than just performance bumps, features for instance. Sure we got FSR and RSR, but compared to DLSS they're inferior, naturally because Nvidia put an AI chip on their cards specifically for DLSS. Now Nvidia's rolling out DLSS 3 with Frame Generator and good lord, once they get the kinks worked out it'll be a monster. \n\nI just hope AMD can figure something out quick, instead of trying to go blow for blow with Nvidia; that's a fight they will not win.",
      "> The 7600XT is literally just a rebadge, plain and simple. Nothing to see here. :(\n\nIf it's based on the N33, then it clearly isn't a rebadge, but it won't be more than 20% faster (on avg) than N23 either, and even that isn't a given. RT should see more of a gain, but not sure how viable that is outside of perhaps RT shadows.",
      "X1900 XTX was the first in 2006 fallowed by the 1950 XTX.",
      "Tbh I'm expecting prices to be a lot better than many doom and gloomers. 7900 XT is starting a hundred less than the 6900 XT and not selling. AMD tends to be quick to adjust prices to market, so I think it'll drop to 800, although probably not formally (AMD seems to favor reimbursing retailers behind the scenes to cut prices rather than formally adjusting MSRP).\n\nThe 7800 XT has 5/7 the CU count and value increases as you go down the stack. 5/7 * 800 = 571. So the 7800 XT is probably gonna be 550-630.\n\n6700 XT and below MSRP's were set during the shortages, 25% tariff, and cryptofuck epidemic. So they were higher than otherwise.\n\nThe 7700 XT is going to be getting 20% more CU's than the 6700 XT, so it will have 80% of the 7800 XT. Again, value tends to increase down the stack until you hit the 6 series. So .80 * 571 = 456.80. So probably 400-450 and it'll perform a bit over halfway between the 6800 and 6800 XT, probably closer to the 6800 XT.\n\n7600 XT is probably gonna be around 6700 XT performance. 7700 XT has 50% more CU's than it, 456.80 * 0.66 = 304). The 6 series is where value tends to drop off, so I think it'll be 300-340.\n\nThe 7600 is 28 CU's, or 7/8 the 6600/7600 XT. So it should be no trouble to match a 6600 XT and will probably come close to the 6650 XT. As for the price, 320 * 7/8 = 280.\n\nA lot of this will depend on what Nvidia is doing, but assuming Intel continues unfucking the drivers and reliably delivers 6700/XT level performance at 250 with the A750, competition is fierce."

      "Good, these cards suck. In fact, most new cards suck, when you consider all of the stuff going on with price, performance, and features. I was watching a GN video from a little while ago about the terrible state of motherboards on modern chipsets. They've taken basic features from 20 years abo (like relaying POST codes to the user) and turned it into a premium feature limited to $350+ boards.\n\nAn anonymous employee quoted in that video referred to it as something like, \"malicious segmentation\" of the products. It seems like GPUs are in a similar state. There is a more aggressive stripping of baseline features on newer cards, as if they're trying to lock people with lower- and mid-range GPUs out of options other than \"buy a new GPU.\"\n\nOverclocking is basically left to exotic cooling solutions, as these companies have gotten more aggressive with power deliveryand maxing out cards. It's bad enough that undervolting is the new overclocking--people who would rather have 95% of performance for 85% of the power draw, versus having GPUs pushing 500W out of the box.\n\nThe cut-down PCIe and VRAM seem to be how these companies are doing it today. When your 1080p card has 8GB of VRAM for ~$300, it's pretty awful. The scaling to 1440p is poor, and the ability to sit on the fence between \"higher fidelity 1080p\" and \"lower fidelity 1440p\" gets tougher to pull off. You can't OC, and you don't have the VRAM to handle 1440p as well if you could. These low- nd mid-range products don't seem to be made around budget customers and providing value. Instead, they seem to be intentionally hamstrung to make sure you get punished for not buying at the top of the product stack. The goal isn't giving you something affordable to meet your needs, it's to give you the absolute bare minimum so they can force you into being a repeat customer.",

I can accept maybe 1 extra product with same CU as some sort of refresh but otherwise it makes no damn sense.\n\n7800XT, 7700XT and 7700 are all probably using N32.\n\nLike 7600 is the max N33 chip.

Not good, not great...I'd pick one up if I was in the market for this category only if it was on sale or had a free game. It's pretty decent for the price but it isn't going to turn any heads.\n\nI'd love to do some undervolting and/or overclocking to it to see what if any gain or efficiency can be made."

Meanwhile AMD cards are more power efficient for the performance they offer than nVidia's.\n\nNvidia 12-16pin (how you prefer to call it) power connector keeps melting but users are blamed as if they never used 6pin and 8pin and other connectors for decades already and this one is the first one to melt. But I assume that news flew by you even though it is still happening.\n\nAnd Intel consumes twice the power of nVidia and AMD for half the performance, absolute inefficiency but a worthy effort for a 1st gen that keeps improving lots by driver updates.\n\nOnly thing sad and wrong is your pessimistic attitude.",

That momentum's really slowed in the last year or so, and they're seemingly reliant on Nvidia's terribly pricing to carry them in sales. It just doesn't feel like AMD has a good grip on its customer base or its products. Having technical, marketing, and design flaws be what feeds the recent bias of the masses isn't good for business, even if this isn't a major problem in and of itself.",

A latch locks the card in place. It is not coming out until you push on the plastic bit. If you can pull GPU out, it wasn't in correctly to begin with. Designs with user-error in mind.\n\nThe new connector? Are they expecting people to go in with a magnifying glass to see if it is all the way in? What do they expect?",

      "The price to performance ratio is really pretty OK on this one. It outperforms the 3060 pretty consistently, which is more expensive. Same with the 6600XT. It has a large generational uplift over the 6600 (seems like around 30% on average) while being in the same neighborhood on price.\n\nI know it's fashionable to hate on GPU manufacturers this month, but really....cmon....this card isn't that bad. For $270, it's not hard to recommend.\n\nThe embarassing part is that AMD's business side seems to be floundering.",

Get this card before stock runs out.",

      "For 1080p it’ll be great. I have a 6600 and I only max out the vram in forza motorsport with maxed out settings. For 1440p I’d definitely consider something with more vram.",
      "man agreed, i wanted the b580 too if i had a choice. Nobody in Denmark wants to buy my RX6800 tho :D",
      "Among the best for that price range is the B580, if your CPU is relatively recent (Intel drivers use up more CPU). If you can manage to get a B580 I highly recommend it, good VRAM for the price, good raster performance, good RT performance (unlike the AMD offerings), usable upscaling, and I've heard that frame generation is also okay if it is implemented. Even if XeSS is not supported you can fall back to FSR like the older non-RDNA4 cards",
      "It's a good 1080p GPU. Goes for around 260€ in Germany. You can't max out the settings though, in newer games gonna have to play on medium settings and or fsr.",
      "Great 1080p value.",
      "Great 1080p GPU as long as you can find it for around $250-$270",
      "If you're still on 1080p it'll do just fine. Put together a parts list for my friend who desperately needed an upgrade. He is now on a Ryzen 5 7600x and an RX 7600 as he needed a budget build and RX 7600 was the only thing available at a decent price at the time. If you can find the Intel Arc B580 for MSRP then I would recommend it more but it is usually price hiked pretty egregiously.",
      "It’s decent compared to other cards in the price range. Intel has an edge with its new card. Nvidia sucks in this price range. If you can push for a 7700XT I would 100% recommend that card.",

      "We feel that the B580 eats the 7600's lunch and it's not even close.",
      "8GB vram is terribly minimum, some newer games will literally not launch with med-high settings especially if you have raytracing enabled. The 7600xt seems decent but I wouldn't be sure if it'll perform well in 1440p considering the low memory bandwidth. \n\nRemember, its not about FPS, its about the frametimes. the 4060 suffers from sheer stuttering. \n\nAs a 3060 user I am doomed for the theoretical 2 years or so (depending if prices will go down). I'm stuck with this card and there is no other option unless we're selling my internal organs. Intel did release a beast of the name B580 and I'm honestly considering it despite the major driver issues.",

      "I love reviews like this that look at the  card from the perspective of what it's target audience is and not trying to compare it to $1000 cards and 4K ultra resolutions.",
      "You can get a 4060 for around $280 now so I don't know how you justify 7600 for $10-$20 cheaper tbh. This needs a price drop down to around $230 or so.",
      "Not with 8GB of VRAM. RT is hit and miss and Frame Gen can cause performance regressions when you run out of VRAM.\n\nPersonally if DLSS / RT / Frame Gen are important factors the lowest priced card worth buying is the 4060Ti 16GB. You can run stuff like Ratchet & clank at 1080p RT on at 60 + fps (unlike the 8GB model which drops way below 60 with horrible lows) and you won't have to turn textures down in future titles so you can maintain a more stable frame rate and higher IQ for a lot longer.\n\nIf you want a cheap stop gap card then the 6600 is the way to go IMO and then you hope RDNA 4 / Blackwell offer a reasonable perf/$ uplift at the low end while bumping up VRAM a bit to avoid the issues 8GB cards currently have and will continue to have going forward.",
      "It’s aight 6600 is the monster, back when it was consistently 180 that is.",
      "Go for 4060 at that price difference. You will get DLSS, better efficiency, and can also do RT at 1080p if you care about it.",
      "I think 6700XT will hold on pretty well so if that is an option at a similar price to the 7600XT I can see arguments either way. Me personally would go 6700XT because the extra raster performance will come in handy and 12GB of VRAM is pretty well balanced at that performance tier right now.\n\nOTOH if you like large texture packs then the 16GB on the 7600XT may serve you better so like I say at the same price there are arguments either way.",
      "By not maxing every setting?",
      "You have 16 gigs of vram, my G. 8 gigs is not enough for RT TODAY let alone in 2032, that is an objective fact.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh7kFgHe21k",
      "3060 had higher fps in hogwarts than the 3080 10 gb before they changed it to lower texture quality and not render things properly instead. So it still has better visuals on a 3060 than a 3080.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh7kFgHe21k",
      "Most don't have huge vram impact, mainly textures, FG, and RT. And lowering textures makes everything look like cheeks while also having 0 impact on FPS unlike other settings (as long as you have enough VRAM).\n\nSounds great to buy a brand new GPU and hit the ground running by then dropping textures to 144p. Especially great advice for someone who kept their last GPU for 8 years. Will you even download the texture pack in 2032? Or just delete it?",
      "7600 XT, due to the 16 GB VRAM, but sure. I wouldn't recommend 7600 non XT in 2024.",
      "Yep. Blows my mind as a hobby we've forgotten the very old adage - Ultra settings are placebo and you'd be mad to base your whole life and soul (and benchmark) around those almost universally insane and unrealistic settings, unless you have a fetish for photo mode or something. \n\n\nSwitch games to High or even Medium and you'll have almost the same visuals for a vastly faster (say that three times fast) frame rate. \n\n\n(And cos nowadays we all play at being closest academic markers who need citations, look at the mountain of Digital Foundry videos comparing the different quality modes and the frame rate and visual impact thereof to see that, aside from maybe pop in which even happens on Ultra settings these days anyway, there's bugger all difference between High and Ultra, even Medium, and certainly not noticeable if you're actually playing the fecking game). \n\n\nSo yeah. Switched to High settings the 7600(XT) suddenly is well above the magical 60fps barrier and with the ram looks like a good long term bet. That and the underutilized, for now, AI cores, which I do think will be used by a future FSR variant, and all the weird posturing and dismissals by YouTubers, and forum posters will be quietly forgotten in a years time I predict...\n\n\nAlso forgotten by all these supposed professional reviewers is - in High mode, and some of the more recent games in the last couple of years, the 7600 is within a hairs breadth of the 6700xt which is exactly where it sits in relation to their sales price, so the recommendation to just buy that instead isn't as much a better value for money proposition so much as it is bang on the upgrade. (Having said that in older games yes it is a larger jump. Again though for someone like me so wanted a card that could work with a smaller PSU, have 16GB, and potentially have some of that sweet sweet AI core action, and not living in the US, the 7600XT isn't some horrific purchase.",
      "The 7600 is 298€ in my country vs the 4060 for 312€. I've been meaning to pick one of those since my 1060 is dying, but can't really decide. You think the 4060 is better, or should i go for the 7600?",
      "If you want to keep a card as long as your 1060 has lasted no 8GB card will do it and I personally think the 3060 12GB is a little too weak. Options are basically 7600XT / 6700XT depending on price in your region or you spend a bit more a jump to the 4060 Ti 16GB / RX 6800 depending on if RT / DLSS are important to you or if pure raster performance matters more. For a stint as long as the 1060 I think DLSS / RT / Frame Gen may be more beneficial than a bit more pure raster performance but that is your call to make really.",
      "I wasn't looking too much at vram since i don't play graphically intensive games, mostly indie and competitive shooters. The 6700xt is within my budget but since i will be keeping a new card for at least 5 years i wasn't sure if buying a one that's already 3 years old was a good idea. Guess i'll think about it some more.",
      "you should always use upscaling with RT at every resolution, and dlss is fine at 1080p. Not quite as good as native but 30% faster is still an objectively reasonable tradeoff to make, and it’s not the same thing at all as fsr completely losing it at 1080p.\n\nif you would consider the tradeoff of FSR 2.x acceptable at 4k, in terms of visual quality loss - that's probably roughly where DLSS quality is at 1080p.  But people seem to think the latter is an unacceptable tradeoff while loving the former.",
      "10%, sometimes, right now, doesn't mean a whole lot when it will last longer in time due to VRAM and better driver/features support.",
      "7600XT isn't worth the $80 premium it currently sits at ($250 vs $330), there's also still a 6700XT you can get for $330, in either case the 7600XT makes absolutely no sense.",
      "> can also do RT at 1080p \n\nHow will you do RT with 8 gigs of vram, lol? The real answer is get neither. Either wait or get a 3060, 6700 xt, or 6800. 8 gigs of vram is beyond cheeks now let alone in 2032.",
      "You could get the 4060. Mainly because it sounds like you are a fairly casual user and the 4060 has very low power consumption compared to the 6700 xt. A quieter card and less hot card is less issues to deal with.\n\nThe 6700xt is overall faster and better and should have an easier time running games down the line.\n\nCheck out this video that directly compares the 4060 to the 6700xt. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI0GS0IBMoI"

One thing that interests me is that when AMD first started shipping their Zen architecture CPUs based on chiplets, performance was still a little behind Intel.

I think that there's some learning that takes place in the transition to the chiplet design, and I'm hopeful that the Radeon RX7000 series basically their GPUs version of Zen 1.  When we get to the 8000 and 9000 series I'd hope to see them more on par with nVidia.",

So if I buy a 7600 for 270 dollars right now, I would essentially be paying \\~10% more for a better encoder, and in some cases worse performance than if I went for the 6650xt. Even worse, I can get a 6700 for 280 bucks, 10 dollars more, with an extra 2GB of VRAM.  \n\n> Laughable how paid off this shit actually is. Just watch the end notes of the 4060Ti reviews and then 7600. OMG AMD TERRIBLE!!!!! Meanwhile Nvidia gets a slight slap on the wrist from them. \n\nNope. The 4060TI got flamed as well. \n\nThe fact that this comment is getting upvoted despite having so much info just completely wrong is beyond me, and just goes to show how when people act like AMD is the scapegoat of the PC gaming community, even when it isn't, people go out of their way to updoot and agree, while ignoring the rest of the comment, which has information that is just factually incorrect.",
      "you know you can get 6700 performance for 300 buying a 6700 right?",
      "Nah. I live in Taiwan and the prices for most of AMD 6000 GPUs just wouldn’t drop. Thus the 7600 actually kind of make sense here. It has been long that we got a decent GPU priced under 9000 NTD.",
      "The 2080 was right between the 3060 and 3060TI. The 3070 was competing with the 2080TI",
      "Not sure in Brazil but the previous generation 6700XT can be gotten for the same price as a 7600 and performs better (50% bigger bit bus and VRAM as well).",
      "This. Everyone keeps repeating just buy the 6700 non-xt instead. I can't even find one here and I can buy from 3 countries thru friends and relatives lol and the rest of the 6000 series' prices aren't dropping either.",
      "Are you comparing pricing to current 6650xt pricing? Cause it’s cheaper than the original 6600 isn’t it?",
      "Don't compare it to the 6600 but to the 6600 XT, which is the predecessor. Same performance, same price (or worse), same power consumption. Essentially a rebadge.\n\nThe naming is artificially shifted from 7600 XT to 7600 to make it look like a bigger jump.",
      "Because there is little to none generational improvement, which to be fair the 7600 should be more directly compared to the 6600 not the 6600 xt, 6650xt. Naming scheme aside the performance should be better especially when there's plenty of last gen stock around that preform the same if not better for a better price",
      "WTF are u talking about?  \n6650XT has the same specs with 7600 and we should compare it to weaker 6600? Only because AMD called it 7600 without XT and lowered price?  \n\n\n7600 is 6650XT on 6nm with better RT cores - this is only difference",
      "Then it's a relatively good product for Brazil. That doesn't change the fact that it's a bad/mediocre product in places where 6700xts can be found for around $300.",
      "The cheapest RX 6700 actually costs [340€](https://www.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/10GB-XFX-Radeon-RX-6700-Speedster-SWFT-309-Core-Gaming-GDDR6_1477805.html) in Europe, while the RX 7600 \"only\" costs 300€. But the 6700 is discontinued, so there are not many left. That's by far the cheapest RX 6700, other sellers charge 370€ which is the same price as the RX 6700 XT.\n\nBut the RX 7600 is in the reviews often closer to the [RX 6650XT](https://webshop.asus.com/de/90YV0HS2-M0NA00/ASUS-Dual-Radeon-RX-6650-XT-V2-OC-Edition-8GB-GDDR6-Gaming-Grafikkarte) which only costs 250€.

It's too expensive for what it actually can do.\n\nAnd i don't see why anyone is even trying to defend a card that has so much trouble beating the XT variant of the last gen. It's not FX-level horrible, but it's far from being good or even just ok.",

      "Navi 21 (6900 XT, 6800 XT, 6800) was announced in October 2020.\n  Navi 22 (6700 XT) was announced in March 2021.\n  Navi 23 (6600 XT) was announced in July 2021.\n\nWith Navi 31, AMD chose to release all variants of the chip as 7900. Because it's a smaller chip than Navi 21 (so probably better yields), AMD might not see a need to release a further cut down variant.\n\nSo I'm guessing that Navi 32 will be used for the 7800 XT. Then its cut down variant will either be a 7800 or 7700 XT. It would also depend on what NVIDIA does with the former 4080 12GB and how Navi 32 compares to it in performance.\n\nNavi 33 might be 6700 XT or 6600 XT, or both.\n\nFor release dates, I'd guess that AMD will tease Navi 32 at CES and provide more details later in Q1.\n\nMy feeling is that AMD has an incentive to have a shorter release cycle with this generation, both because it can beat NVIDIA in value and because Navi 33 will be a better use of the 6/7nm production lines than RDNA 2.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say that Navi 33 has been rumoured to be mobile first, and this makes some sense. There's some chance that we will see it announced at CES for mobile alongside next gen mobile CPUs.",

      ">Imo the interesting GPU worth waiting on is the 7800xt. If it can hit a $699 MSRP and outperform a 6900xt, in at least a few games, that's exciting.\n\nIdeally, we'll get a 72CU Navi 31 part for the 7800XT that will do more than outperform a 6900XT in a few games, for $700.\n\nJust matching or slightly beating a 6900XT for $700 would not be exciting, that'd be quite disappointing, given how close the $650 6800XT already was to a 6900XT two years ago.\n\nYour standards are way too low.",
      "There is no massive 6000 stock. They could stop producing them right now and go full 7000 series, it would be even wise since chiplets use less of 6nm wafers each.",

      "It seems they are keeping the same prices as the original 6000 series, so the 7800 XT might be $649?\n\nI don't know what could be the MSRP for the rest of the lineup, since all cards released during 2021 had inflated launch prices already reflecting the crypto craze.",
      "Don't expect that. Navi 31 shows that they used 96 CUs to achieve 1.6x 6950XT.\n\nWith 32 CUs of Navi 33's 7600 XT (just 1/3 CUs of 7900 XTX), you're looking at something like 30-40% less performance than 6950XT, or roughly 6700-6800 level of performance.",

It'll have to be 7600XT or below or else the performance improvement will look pitiful.",

      "There's a big gap, but it's actually smaller than between Navi 21 (80 CUs) and Navi 22 (40 CUs). The lowest end Navi 21 had 60 CUs, 50% more than a full Navi 22. I think it's reasonable for AMD to release a 60 CU Navi 22 and a 48 CU one with a 192 bit RAM bus, and then the difference between 32 CU Navi 33 and the 48 CU SKU would be 50%, which won't be higher than the Navi 22 to 21 gap.\n\n> or else the performance improvement will look pitiful.\n\nYou mean like the 6500 XT over the 5500 XT? Hasn't stopped AMD before.\n\nIf a 60 CU chip is 7800 XT, then a 32 CU chip could be 7700 XT. That's very close in ratio when compared to the 72 CU 6800 XT and 40 CU 6700 XT. So I wouldn't rule it out.",

There tends to be far more granularity in the lower-mid range markets.\n\n>You mean like the 6500 XT over the 5500 XT? Hasn't stopped AMD before.\n\nThe 6500XT would never have been released in the desktop space if not for the wild cryptomining craze that drove GPU demand to infinity, which meant that desperation for GPU's increased prices of even lower end GPU's a huge amount.",
      "3-6 months but you could get a 6800 in the $400-$500 range right now and get similar performance except maybe in ray tracing but if fsr 3 works on RDNA 2, then it will get a boost in performance, too. \n\nImo the interesting GPU worth waiting on is the 7800xt.

The last decade's top end is now the price of this decades previous grn top end. Which is horrible.\n\nOn the other hand, as a content creator, I can get so much more out of consumer based cards today, the premium is well worth it.\n\n Also, as long as your card has a significant amount of RAM, today's mid to top end cards should last a lot longer. DLSS and FSR are game hangers for many who can't upgrade every gen or every other gen. Granted, again...you make the choice to get a card with a lot of vram.

Tech is pretty much down across the board as the era of almost free loans is over and demand is lighter after everyone was trying to get whatever they could during the pandemic. I think they're toying around with what they can get away with price wise to try to buffer the losses. Hopefully it'll lead to better prices in the consumer section on mid and low end cards. High end demand never really seems to stop as people with disposable income keep coming back for more despite market conditions."

Gamers are free to  enable AFMF in these titles based on their preference and gameplay  style, however, they may not experience optimal performance –  specifically at lower frame rates.\n      * AFMF may be enabled or disabled on the fly using the default hotkey of Alt-Shift-G.\n   * AFMF currently requires the game to be played in fullscreen mode with VSYNC disabled. \t\t\n      * For better compatibility with borderless-fullscreen titles, Windows 11 users can enable [\"Optimizations for windowed games\"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/optimizations-for-windowed-games-in-windows-11-3f006843-2c7e-4ed0-9a5e-f9389e535952).\n      * For a better visual experience, AFMF is recommended to be used with variable refresh rate enabled.\n   * Users can check AFMF’s frame generation status using AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition™’s in-game overlay.\n   * AFMF adds frame generation technology to boost FPS outside the  game’s engine. Users can use AMD Software Performance Metrics Overlay to  see the resulting FPS. \t\t\n      * Support for third-party performance monitoring tools is not available at this moment.\n   * For systems setup using Hybrid Graphics (such as laptops featuring  an integrated and discrete GPU), AFMF must be supported on the  displaying GPU to be activated.\n   * Stay tuned for future enhancements and innovations coming to  HYPR-RX with AFMF, focusing on elevating image quality, smoothness, and  latency. Enjoy gaming with HYPR-RX.\n   * **AMD Video Upscaling** \n   * AMD Video Upscaling can be enabled for most DirectX 11  applications to improve image quality. However, certain applications  such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge may require an additional step  to activate AMD Video Upscaling. \t\t\n      * For Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, 'Media Foundation for  Clear' must be enabled. This setting can be configured in the browser  settings accessed through chrome://flags/ or edge://flags/.\n   * Users have the flexibility to adjust the level of sharpness added  by AMD Video Upscaling using the slider located within the Graphics tab.\n* **AMD Technical Preview Driver** \n   * Users had the opportunity to get an early look of AFMF through  the AMD Technical Preview Drivers and provide their feedback to build  and refine the feature. The feedback received through our online  communities and [AMD Bug Report Tool](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/amdbrt) helped create a more stable experience for AFMF in AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 24.1.1. \n   * Users looking for updates of future AMD Technical Preview Drivers can subscribe to our newsletter [HERE](https://www.amd.com/en/forms/sign-up/gaming-software-news.html).\n\n## Fixed Issues\n\n* Performance drop may be observed in some DirectML workloads.\n* Intermittent grey screen after driver upgrade with certain monitors (such as Nixeus NX-EDG274K) on Radeon™ RX 7000 series GPUs.\n* Graphics API metric may show as N/A in certain UWP applications.\n* Heavy stuttering may be experienced while playing Warframe and loading into a new area or starting a mission.\n* Black artifacts may be observed in smoke effects while playing Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III.\n* Black texture flickering may be observed while playing Starfield on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 5600 XT.\n* Intermittent install failure may be observed when using the factory reset setting.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n* Deathloop may experience extended loading times on some AMD  Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 6900 XT. \\[Resolution targeted  for 24.2.1\\]\n* Dead Space may experience an application crash after enabling RTAO on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 6800.\n* Excessive stuttering may be experienced when first playing a match in Overwatch 2. \\[Resolution targeted for 24.2.1\\]\n* Audio may intermittently become out of sync with the video when  recording from AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition using AV1 codec.  \\[Resolution targeted for Q2\\]\n* Oculus Rift S may display with a green tint on AMD Radeon™ RX 7000 series GPUs.\n* After a system reboot, Parsec host application may experience a  crash on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX.  \\[Resolution targeted for 24.2.1\\]\n* During Microsoft Teams meetings, the camera may intermittently  display looped footage on some AMD Products, such as the AMD Ryzen™ 7  7840U Processor.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n* For users that game remotely with AMD Link, one important  announcement is that AMD is ending support for the AMD Link software. We  originally launched AMD Link at a time when there were few alternative  remote gaming solutions for Radeon graphics users. Today, there are many  options available for users to stream their PC content to other  devices. AMD’s role is to enable and support developers, not compete  with them. As such, we are ending support for AMD Link and focusing our  resources on other core capabilities and features that benefit users. We  will also continue to support developers with our SDKs such as the [AMD Advanced Media Framework](https://gpuopen.com/advanced-media-framework/) that allow them to enable streaming functionality within their solutions.\n* For users who previously installed an AMD Software preview driver,  running AMD Cleanup Utility is recommended before installing this  driver.\n* AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 24.1.1 will now automatically clear  previously installed drivers located in the C:\\\\AMD folder to save  space.\n\n# ",

Probably just crappy drivers. SMH why can’t radeon just work around my unstable hardware like nvidia does? \n\nObvious sarcasm aside, if you’re getting BSODs it’s not a driver issue and more than likely a hardware instability issue. I haven’t seen a driver caused BSOD in a long time and not even on the dedicated help for AMD drivers subreddit.",

After you alt tab you can move the cursor around as expected, but the moment you select something you get a frozen image. This problem persists into matches - everything is frozen and won't update unless you alt tab out. God of War and GTA V also had arc-like problems with flickering and hitching in the settings menu.\n\nRocket League's the game that the 7600 won't utilise fully in with a triple monitor config. It literally won't break 70% utilisation. Single and dual works fine.\n\nI admit I don't know why the issue with safe mode  happens (it also happens in bios). It might be on Elgato in all fairness, but I can't say. The only other card I have that will automatically output to the 4k60 in safe mode and bios is the ARC A770. No other card does it.",

Flickering settings menus, performance that tanks unexpectedly, an issue where GPU utilisation won't max out under load when you have more than two monitors connected, and even an issue where if you boot into safe mode with a capture card connected then the card will only output an image to the capture card. Even AMDs own hardware recognition tool (for redeeming 'free' games) won't register that there's a 7600 in my system.\n\nThe 7600's drivers needed a lot longer in the oven.

      "Exactly, I completely agree with you. There's a chance they'll take a hint from tech outlets like HUB and MLID and go for a sensible price, but since the 6000 series ended up being good value and selling well (which was precisely because they lowered prices but not sure they realized it) they might opt for the same strat this gen and launch at bad prices again, which would only leave a bad taste in consumers' mouths, just like you said.\n\nEven if the chance is slim, I'm praying for them to be smart about pricing and not fuck up."

There’s a few factors to consider here, but I wouldn’t get the 7600 unless it’s a decent bit cheaper than the other cards, but I’ll make everything simple for you:\n\n**Get whatever is the cheapest**.",
      "Idk if they fixed the overhead issue, unless you're using am5 3d cpus, the b580 will be worse than 4060",
      "Only an issue with weaker old CPUs with no resize bar support, (not even an issue since you can technically mod / update it) \n\nSo for the 7500f the B580 is a great option."

Here’s my system:\n\nCPU: Ryzen 7 5800X3D\nGPU: ASUS TUF RX 7600 XT OC\nRAM: 16 GB DDR4 3600 MHz\n\nI mainly play Rainbow Six Siege, but I’d like to future-proof my setup for upcoming titles and handle higher resolutions better.\n\nI was thinking about a 4060ti 16gb. \n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

      "Even better. The thing is going from 7600 xt to 4060 16gb isn't much of an upgrade it's not more powerful it just has more vram, so I personally don't think it's worth it. If I were you I'd save up a little more and make a more meaningful jump, it'll just be much better value.",
      "Ohh right the xt version has 16gb I forgot. In that case there'd be basically no benefit from switching to the 4060 16gb other than some Nvidia features, since they have similar performance. If you want an Nvidia GPU I'd recommend the 4070 ti super. You could also go with the 4070 ti but it has 4gb less vram than the 7600 xt despite being more powerful so I personally don't like it."

      "Yep, when I was mining back in 2017/2018 I tested this for the fun of it. The 6x1070s I had of the same model and batch (EVGA and ascending serial number with no gaps) had a 3%~ performance delta in Time Spy at stock. With a larger sample size I wouldn't be surprised if the real delta might have been closer or maybe even higher than 5% of top vs bottom.",
      "And when mining same batch sometimes had huge differences in how much you could underclock them too. I had card that could be undervolted almost 50mv more than one other in the same batch",

      "The main explanation is that these smaller and smaller nodes are very picky.  The transistor density and count is quite high.  The manufacturing tolerances are now the providence of very difficult physics and bleeding-edge facilities.   They are a bit more sensitive to voltage than the huge nodes of the past.\n\nHonestly, we are getting to the point where each CPU simply is a proverbial unique snowflake.  Even after binning, each CPU is going to be a bit picky, doubly so for those that are multiple pieces of silicon packaged together into one final product.  \n\nI think it's just a lesson for us not that companies have changed any more than they were over the previous half decade, but that if you get a CPU that simply can't be made to hit numbers that make sense... it's up to you if you wish to return it, try changing coolers, getting a different SKU, etc.  \n\nThere's no shame in doing a return of an individual product you're not feeling good about.  But if its numbers are normal, just keep it.  I'm not saying people should chase golden samples through returns, as that just eventually gets noticed by customer service and can affect the ability to get future products.",

It’s just that the market only needs so much segmentation.  We don’t really need to see a 7550X and 7650X SKU just to split power efficiency hairs.",

But usually it’s just a bear minimumly functioning within the loser spec piece of silicone.\n\nIf he buys a bunch if 7800x3Ds there would likely be much less variance as the base minimum standard is so much higher for binning for of the silicone to be eligible to be that CPU.",

      ">I'm just glad to see that PC gaming isn't quite the boy's club it used to be\n\nI think you are arguing a strawman that never happened in the first place.  The \"boys club\" bit by some overzealous terminally online moral busybodies is an overused cliche used by people who haven't been paying attention to gaming for the past 10 years.\n\nI've literally *never* heard of a conversation where a guy teased a girl for making a computer \"girly\".  In fact, Yeston coming out with those off the wall designs were actually a breath of fresh air to everyone.  It's not because of some ideological premise of wanting PC gaming to have some population equity between the sexes (and there's a high chance it never will), but because the designs were out of the box and unique.\n\nSomeone at marketing at all these AIBs and NVIDIA/AMD themselves thought the overused ultra dark \"edgy\" militaristic/future designs was what everyone wanted.  The only problem is *all* the manufacturers thought this was the case, which led to everything looking samey from a design standpoint.\n\nYeston flipped that market upside down and reminded people that there are different demographics with different interests who would love to see a GPU that isn't just marketed towards the xXxSTEALTHNINJAASSASSINxXx COD crowd.  Japan, for example, actually has occasional Japan-only PC hardware releases that feature all kinds of anime-style designs/promotions.\n\nThe fact it took a company not many of us in the West have heard of to finally turn back the clock on overly edgy GPU designs was a long time coming.  And it's not like the brand itself is a newcomer, its parent company, Shenzhen Yingjiaxun Industrial Limited, has been in the Chinese IT industry since 2000.  Yeston was founded as a sub-brand of the company in the same year, but I guess they finally started making inroads when people started noticing their GPU and case designs.\n\nI am just making an educated guess here, but I'm thinking Yeston was the sub-brand that was given creative freedom to make off-the-wall components designs, and a designer or engineer at Yeston probably thought several years back making graphics cards that move away from the COD player demo might actually be worth taking a shot at.  There were already some older cards that hinted at this move away - I've seen pictures of a GT 730 and an RTX 550, for example, that were in a garish magenta color.

My 5600xt seems to be able to handle 1440p med settings for most games and 4k fsr med settings for old aaa titles. I’ve read so many bad reviews about the 4060 and 7600xt but getting a 6750 or 6700xt is much more expensive even at second hand prices here in our country. Looking for your kind opinions on which I should get possibly long term for the mentioned things I needed. I don’t edit much but planning in the future. I plan to use the card in b550 mortar msi board with 3200 mhz ram and 3600 r5. Happy to hear your opinions. I just can’t decide. Main game is valorant and nba 2k25 and occasionally aaa titles. ",

      "He is right if rtx 4060 is 300 the Rx 7600 should be 250 or less",
      "cheapest 7600 is currently 257$ most amd cards are hella discounted a 6950xt was $580 for the past couple of days and stuff like that",
      "Wait, its unusable? I have a rtx 3060 12gb and i can comfortably use ray tracing in spiderman and metro exodus 70fps+ high setting. is the rtx4060 really that bad?",
      "I remember HUB saying the Fortnite RT performance was indicative of strong RDNA3 ray tracing in future UE5 titles, where RDNA3 would be just as good as Ada Lovelace. But not only is the 4060 beating the 7600 in every other ray tracing title, it is also faster in Fortnite RT.",
      "The 6700XT comes with Starfield Premium ($30 difference) however and 12GB of VRAM. \n\nThe 7600 makes no sense to me because you go from $260-$70=$190 to $320-100=$220 to make a gap of $30 for 12GB of VRAM and performance close to a 4060Ti in most titles. All assuming you'd purchase Starfield Premium regardless.",
      "7600 also comes with Starfield.",
      "Yeah. I got a 6700xt for $300 on prime day",
      "I have a 2060 and I have played with RT on with DLSS in several games with over 60fps at 1080p. HUB has brainwashed a legion of users into thinking RT is unusable on low end cards and that DLSS is terrible at 1080p when neither can be further from the truth. A bit of clever settings tweaks and you can get a decent experience with RT enabled even on these cards. And by these cards I mean Nvidia cards because it is unusable on AMD but maybe that's why HUB is trying so hard to invalidate the feature entirely.",
      "I do like their new benchmarking format with the stronger RT showing. Hope they keep this for the 7800/7700 reviews.\n\nKind of odd that AMD prices have actually gone up in the last few weeks. A week after launch you could get multiple 7600 for $250 I think, but now many of those are $10 to $20 higher again. Better just to wait for a 4060 to go on sale for $280-290.",
      "It is sad that while the 4060 is 15-18% faster than the 3060 (which is not nothing, I mean, the 4060Ti is just 5% faster than the 3060Ti), so there is a performance uplift to be had, the VRAM capacity cut down to 2/3 definitely hurts it. The 4060 is quite faster, but once you are out of VRAM that becomes irrelevant, it is game over. The 3060 will be a relevant card for longer than the 4060, even though it is slower and two years older.  \n\n\nFor the 7600 there is nothing to be said. It is for all practical purposes a rebranded 6600XT/6650XT. Ever so slightly faster. An embarrassing product.  \n\n\nStill, if I were to recommend any card between these two, I would say skip both. Get either the 6600XT/6650XT (especially if you want Starfield) which are still available and cheaper than the 7600, or get the 3060.",
      "6700 XT is the best GPU you can buy at the current pricing, it beats all of these crappy so called new gen GPUs.",
      "The problem is that new AMD cards do not have any major advantages/features over last gen cards. You get AV1 encoding and displayport 2.1, but that is it. Both of those things may not even be needed/used by the people buying the cards, FSR2 works with any card, FSR3 doesn't exist, RT gains are almost 1:1 with raster improvements, and the 32CU RX 7600 and 32CU RX 6650XT are within 2% of each other. At least with RTX 40 series cards, you can point to DLSS3 or massive efficiency gains even if the price is trash.\n\nStarfield comes out early September, and everyone will want to play it on day 1. A flash sale $300-330 RX 6700XT/6750XT comes with a key to play it, and I don't expect price/performance to improve from there.",
      "Well, on the bright side this means that both 6000 series AMD and 30 series Nvidia cards will be viable for longer. If performance remains stagnant there’s no need to upgrade for many years to come.",
      "Is that really very abnormal? Didn't the GTX 1080 outperform the RTX 2060 in FPS per dollar a month after launch with 1080 clearance pricing?1070 vs 1660ti? Didn't the R9 390 and 290 outperform the Rx 480 a month after launch in perf/$? I'm curious to know, but it's hard to find market prices that far back.",
      "Prices went up a couple of days after the Starfield bundle started. AMD has to pay Bethesda/MS for a Starfield license to bundle it. Granted, AMD is paying a FAR lower price than end users, but it's not nothing.\n\nAdding to that, AMD RDNA2 sales likely increased due to the Starfield promotion and the 4060/TI's impotence while supply also decreased, so the prices went up a bit.",
      "The 3060 was also a pretty miserable card to start with being barely faster than a 2060 Super, so for it to still be going for that price is especially sad, 12GB or not.",
      "I am, means I don't have any buyer's remorse that's usually there after the new gen after the one you have comes out.",
      "I don't understand why that is an excuse for RDNA3 underperforming on the 7600 when the 4060 has the exact same memory situation. Both cards are working with the same amount of data transfer."

      "To cut through all the noise:\n\nClaims made:\n\n1. Reiterates claim that there was never any technology exclusivity stipulations, citing devs.\n2. Insiders at Nvidia confirm their Starfield drivers are bad/incomplete, citing a lack of funding and reallocation of resources to AI development. (Seems reasonable.)\n3. Per Bethesda insider, Starfield originally used a renderer built on Vulkan API, then switched to DX12 late in development. They partnered with AMD for two reasons: 1) to get help implementing FSR2, and 2) to get help switching from the Vulkan-based renderer to DX12, given AMD's intimate understanding of/contributions to Vulkan (by way of Mantle).\n4. Bethesda didn't have a working version of the game to present to Nvidia and Intel for optimization until late into production. \"A lot of the old Vulkan codebase was there with AMD DLLs that had not been translated yet.\"\n5. AMD insider says \"most of the prelaunch work \\[AMD\\] did on this game was just trying to make it run well on their cards at all\" rather than necessarily optimizing their drivers, hence some lingering issues like the widely-reported stars not rendering.\n6. RTX 4070 has dropped in price to $549 in response to 7800 XT. (Confirmed/corroborated by others as well.)\n7. \"RX 7600 XT 10GB/12GB\" likely not real. Source speculates it could be \"just another example of an AIB staking out a name, or corporate is trying to mess with Nvidia.\"\n8. Intel Twin Lake is a refresh of \"Alder Lake N\" all-E-core CPU, still using Gracemont cores, fabbed on Intel 7 process.\n\n\\---\n\n\\---\n\n\\---\n\nA couple thoughts:\n\n1. Couches dev statements in lots of \"would\" and \"would not\" statements, no \"did\" and \"did not\" ones. In other words, doesn't seem he spoke with many, if any, devs who 1) had AMD-sponsored games, and 2) said definitively whether their contract imposed a ban on competing technologies or not. (That's not to lend the original accusation any undue legitimacy. It's still extremely sus as well, and any self-respecting person should remain highly skeptical, at least in my view of it.)\n2. &#x200B;\n3. Does his own analysis a major disservice when he discusses the Starfield partnership and mischaracterizes the announcement as \"self-described \\[by AMD\\] as a surprise.\" As proof he cites a Digital Trends article that begins, \"AMD has just announced an unexpected “exclusive” partnership with Bethesda and Starfield...\" where it's clear he completely misreads it and twists it to fit the narrative he's building, ie that Bethesda contacted AMD late in development for help with Starfield, and AMD were caught off-guard by the request. There's plenty of decent evidence and analysis otherwise, making that bit wholly unnecessary.\n\nThe rest seem reasonable enough.",

      "Well, in cases like this, a \"control group\" isn't really appropriate. What would a control group look like? Games that have both technologies? AMD-sponsored titles that have one? the other? both? neither? Nvidia-sponsored titles? Non-sponsored titles? And so on. There is no real control group. The hypothesis postulated by Wccftech is \"AMD blocks DLSS from its sponsored titles; Nvidia does not block FSR from its sponsored titles.\" So it's fair enough to do a simple observational study and rudimentary statistical analysis; Wccftech were right on that mark.\n\nUnfortunately, as you say, the sample size they drew conclusions from - 20 titles total, 13 AMD-sponsored, 7 Nvidia-sponsored - was simply too small to, well, draw conclusions from. Gamers Nexus, [as part of basic background research for its news summary video that week](https://youtu.be/w_eScXZiyY4?si=Y9wCRJyQidHmNGvo&t=320), managed to find ***29*** AMD-sponsored titles (123% more than Wccftech managed), of which 14 were FSR-only. They also found [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/14f2nlw/comment/joy38sp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with a more general analysis of all games that have some form of image reconstruction tech. From that data, it's impossible to say with any great deal of certainty that any vendor is/was doing any amount of blocking of any technology.\n\nRegarding AMD's \"No comment\" response to GN...\n\n\\- Given the specificity of GN's question (\"Does the contract between AMD and Bethesda have any language which intentionally blocks ***or could be construed as blocking or limiting*** Bethesda's ability to integrate alternative upscaling technologies within Starfield?\" (emphasis mine)), and...\n\n\\- Given what Frank Azor said in a recent The Verge interview (something like \"Yes, we request that partners prioritize our tech, but it's a request, not a demand.\"),\n\n...it's not surprising that AMD would choose not to comment.\n\nOf course, Azor's statement to The Verge could just be a smokescreen and they indeed did have such contractual language in place that they walked back after the backlash... but without a smoking gun pointing to any of that being the case, that suggestion holds about as much water as me suggesting that Lisa Su regularly dices onions super fine for Jensen Huang, who then takes them and massages them into his open eyes for fun.",
      "I'm a programmer, I have a game open in the background a lot. And I do stuff in Unreal a lot. There's a lot of usage of my 3D card.",
      "Seems reasonable.",
      "What irritates me the most is that regardless of whether AMD *did* block DLSS or not, the initial accusation itself is so poorly-written and so poorly-argued that it should have been dismissed out of hand but was instead uncritically taken up by almost everyone, including members of the media, and ESPECIALLY including outlets like HUB whose judgements I generally held in high esteem beforehand. Literally the only group I saw treat this with a proper amount of skepticism was Gamers Nexus, who rightly saw too little evidence to give it the time of day. HUB and others gave the accusation a token nod of skepticism, but for the most part treated it as fact, to the point where they were posting whole videos uncritically arguing with AMD fanboys uncritically defending a practice that hadn't even been proven.\n\nIt's a whole ass controversy built on such an obviously *stupid* base. Like, if the Wccftech article had been written better, if it had hidden its intentions better, I could at least appreciate the subtlety. But it wasn't, and it didn't, and IT STILL WORKED. JFC, lol.",
      "I'm still waiting for that control group I keep asking for. This whole thing went off the rails because someone made a list of a select handful of games (non-exhaustive) from both sides with no control group and came to an incomplete conclusion.

      "> Otherwise, my computer is on 24/7 \n\nso you don't care about efficiency and energy usage so this whole point is moot.",
      ">just \"accidentally\" unanimously decided not to implement DLSS?\n\nDid I say anything about anyone either accidentally or unanimously deciding not to implement DLSS?\n\nBut to your point: The data so far shows you're wrong, which is entirely my point. Your statement - that \"pretty much only the \\[devs\\] paid by amd ... unanimously decided not to implement DLSS\" - only holds true if you trust the small sample size of 20 games provided by Wccftech (13 AMD-sponsored, 7 Nvidia-sponsored). I wrote in another response, you might have seen it, that Gamers Nexus managed to look at 29 AMD-sponsored games - over double the 13 Wccftech did - and found that less than half (14 of 29) were FSR-exclusive. Gamers Nexus were doing little more than the most basic of background research; you would expect Wccftech to have at least been able to find that many.\n\nSo, does \"pretty much half the \\[devs\\] paid by amd ... unanimously decided not to implement DLSS\" sound nearly as nefarious? No, it doesn't.\n\n>DLSS and FSR take roughly the same amount of dev time to implement, DLSS is superior and Nvidia has an 80% market share.\n\nThe way I understand it, implementing either one takes a bit of effort, then substituting the other in is fairly simple. However, implementing is one thing; QAing and testing is another entirely. You have to make sure the menu toggle works correctly. You have to make sure the algorithms switch correctly. You have to make sure the game recognizes which cards can and can't use DLSS and eliminate that option as necessary. And so on and so forth. It might not be a lot of extra work, but it might be enough that you decide to go with the broadest coverage option rather than the one that provides the best picture quality.\n\nAs for \"market share,\" just citing Nvidia's market share is disingenuous when it comes to discussing the use of DLSS. As you know, DLSS requires the use of an RTX GPU, and my rough math using the Aug 2023 Steam hardware survey shows that only 40% - or half of the total 80% Nvidia market share - are RTX GPus. This means, obviously, that 60% of the market can't use DLSS. However, 100% (or close to 100%, anyway) of the market can use FSR2.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say whether AMD did or did not, or does or does not, block DLSS from its sponsored titles. It IS to say that the Wccftech article that launched this whole controversy was poorly-written and poorly-researched, and it should have been dismissed out of hand almost immediately rather than be taken up uncritically as gospel by the gaming community writ large.",

      "If you want to measure FPS when using upscaling then using the same algorithm across the board to keep variables to a minimum is required.\n\nIf you want to measure IQ then you use the best upscaling method available for each GPU/Game combo.\n\nWhen HUB used FSR across the board for a test it was for the former case, they were not testing IQ, they were measuring FPS so were doing it in a way that kept the workload the same across all GPU hardware which is the correct way to do it.\n\nThey also mentioned (and showed in a later video) that DLSS will give even better IQ for broadly the same kind of frame rate increase so where available always use DLSS instead.\n\nIt is a very logical approach to take in the scenario they were using it for."

They are comparing the 7700XT to the 4060Ti 16GB, so $449 for 7700XT is more in line with that.\n\nEDIT after the prices were announced:  \n$499 for the 7800XT seems OKish, but $449 for the 7700XT is ROFL pricing. It says in EU the prices will be 549 es 489 respectively and right now you can still get the 6800 for 459 and 489EUR which seems like a significantly better option than the 7700XT.",
      "Disappointing that 7800XT=6800XT in terms of performance. Pricing at 449 to 499 dollars would be ideal but knowing AMD they will price it at 549 or similar which is terrible compared to a 599 dollar 4070. The 4070 has all those extra features.\n\nFinally some generational per CU performance improvement.\nThe 60 CU 7800XT is matching 72 CU 6800XT. Not much but it's there.",

      "AMDs marketing department is unhinged. I'm guessing $479 and $579 right now.",
      "That's actually fine if you suitably reduce the prices across the board\n\nFor eg. A 7700xt at 429 or something with 6800XT level of performance.\n\n7600XT at 299 with 6700xt level of performance. That way even if there is no performance improvement you reduce the prices low enough that lower tier cards can enjoy higher tier of performance for the same cost.",
      "AMD will *technically* undercut, just not enough to matter.",
      "7700 XT actually seems interesting, if it really is 12% faster than a 4060 Ti that puts it around 20% ahead of 6700 XT, not an impressive gen to gen performance gain but way better than 7800 XT's literal similar exact performance compared to it's predecessor 6800 XT which is an oof 4060 moment for AMD.\n\nNow, it just depends on the pricing, if 7700 XT is priced at over $400 then it is disappointing, same can be said with 7800XT if it is priced over $500.\n\nIdeal pricing should be:\n\n**7700 XT:  $400 or less**\n\n**7800 XT:  $500 or less**",
      "At 399 it's just... worse value than the 6700xt? Same amount of vram, uses slightly more power, bit better performance, but it costs way more?",
      "All cards this generation are worse value than previous generation honestly. But at 399, it might be equal value (in terms of FPS) depending on how much more performant it is than the 6700 XT. At the very least, 6700 XT is better value because AMD themselves made it so by reducing it up to 25% from what it was in January.",
      "my heart hopes you are wrong, but my brain says he is right....",
      "It is the same though. Sure no one with a 6800XT would “upgrade” to a 7800XT, but if they price it exactly at or above what the 6800XT is available at right now, then why did those “new people” wait? \n\nThe answer is they were waiting for 6800XT performance for 6700XT price or less, because that’s the precedent for the past decade or more. Improving energy efficiency and keeping the price the same while shouting “INFLATION!” isn’t good enough to justify these cards’ existence - especially not when RAM chip prices are way down, AMD is building these on a mature previous gen node, and while they’re not breaking record profits, they’re still more than profitable and being down 18-20% from the COVID spike is misleading at best. \n\nIf the XTX had simply been the 7900 XT and everything else got bumped down a tier, this lineup would look great. A 7700XT (current 7800XT) with the performance of a 3080 12GB or 6800 XT for $450? Awesome! Positive momentum and genuine reason to justify a purchase or recommend. \n\nInstead we got the “Biff is King” timeline, but without real hoverboards.",
      "No FSR 3.0 info in the slides so probably a no show. AMD must move on to next gen sooner rather than later if they hope to stay relevant in the gpu market. Nvidia has pushed ahead in RT and AI and AMD seriously needs to catch up.",
      "If it’s true that the 7800 XT more or less matches the 6800 XT in performance, I genuinely wonder what AMD plans to do to fill the gap between that and the 7900 XT. There’s quite a big performance delta between the two. I know the 7900 GRE exists, but are they planning on giving it a wider release?",
      "The radeon playbook",
      "No, but if you were AMD, it would be wise to compare it to the 16gb card, because its priced so ridiculous. Here's hoping for $399 still.",
      "For new people? It's not \"the same\", it has similar performance but greater power efficiency and new feature sets.\n\nThis isn't really for people who bought the 6800xt to \"upgrade\", its for people buying a card today to get something better overall.\n\nIt's not a far out idea, its what most companies do and have always done.",
      "I predict:\n\n$579 for 7800XT\n\n$499 for 7700XT",
      "Now watch AMD burn their market share by pricing themselves out of the market, get horrible reviews, only to go back to reasonable price 3-6 months after damage is done.\n\nEdit: Well, color me surprised for 7800xt. \nThey still pulled that shit for 7700xt, though."

And relative to Nvidia it's quite excellent.)",

      "The 7800XT would be like a 6900XT but slightly more efficient if those numbers are accurate.\n\nI'm more puzzled by the 7700XT, which would be like a 6800 non-XT, with similar power consumption but less VRAM?",

      "Rational posts like this are a breath of fresh air in this sub lately. Nice stuff. Agreed, the naming is bad, but at least the price is right.",
      "Basically, the 7800 XT is a win, but only because nVIDIA didn't release the 4070 as a 4060 Ti for 499$, which I'm pretty sure they could have - but of course, no point where ***cough*** AI ***cough***.",
      "People speculate the 7700xt is overpriced on purpose to push people into buying the 7800xt. Also supposedly the fabrication process has an 85% yield rate, so in theory only 15% of all cards should be 7700xts, but at launch it's 50/50, so they are pushing people into buying all the 7809xt stock. They e been accumulating the chips for many months, not selling the cards yet to get rid of 6000 series stock, then they play this game to push out more 7800xt stick, then will drop the price of 7700xt in a month or two to sell those 15% yields. Assuming I understood the YouTubers correctly, who spread unverified rumors with nameless sources.",
      "Well, that's because the 4060 is objectively bad value though?",
      "Yeah, it’s decent in isolation. I’m still kind of annoyed that this particular generational uplift took nearly *three years*, but at least it is one. That hasn’t happened since the 3060 Ti, maybe the 7600 if we’re being generous.",
      "The 7800XT....if the leaked performance is true, you get 4070-level performance (high fps 1440p ultra) for 15-20% cheaper. That's solid value (yes not amazing, but reasonable). 500$ is a price many people can afford for a GPU, and now you can get a solid 1440p experience or even 4K for that price.",
      "Note the RT data is quite skewed towards Cyberpunk. They even included RT overdrive benchmarks for w/e reason which was never meant to run on Radeon lmao... even with Cyberpunk benchmarked **4 times** out of the 9 results, the RDNA3 GPUs are still holding up against their counterpart in RT. If you ignore Cyberpunk overdrive, 7700xt is 1.875% faster than 4060ti on average in RT (with Cyberpunk being benched 3 times). The 7800xt would be 4.375% slower than the 4070 in RT as well.\n\nThat brings me to conclude that the 7700xt is actually decent value vs 4060ti 16 GB on paper even if they are both \\~$450. With the 4060ti, you mainly gain DLSS 2 and 3, which isn't always present in all games (or you can pay for it lol ...), and 4GB more VRAM. The 7700xt has roughly equal RT and 15% better Raster on the other hand.",
      "The main reason that happened was oversupply of last gen stock, so AMD fronted the generational value uplift via discounts, then slotted in these two more or less based on that.\n\nPersonally, even if it makes reviews boring, this strategy is **far** more customer friendly than the typical one. These GPU's are designed, and prototypes are made WAY ahead of time, so selling you reheated leftovers for full price one day and then immediately launching something that makes that price look silly is kind of entrapment...\n\nThey would have came out earlier, but people were incensed that last gen clearance pricing was better value than the 7600 (since last gen is more expensive to make for a given tier of performance so selling through it is top priority).\n\nSo since everyone told AMD that launching the 7600 when they did was an unwinnable situation, they held off releasing these two until last gen products were almost out of stock.",
      "The same people defending the 4060 will be screaming the 7800xt is bad value.",

      "fwiw, the average RT scores (which tbf, are not in the original data, but videocardz's summary) are unfairly biased by cyberpunk being included 4 times in the overall averages (i mean, all these games are cherry picked to a certain degree, but having the worst AMD performing game included multiple times is particularly egregious)   \n  \nIf only RT ultra is included, which seems reasonable since the 4070 only manages 18fps in overdrive, the 7800xt vs  4070 changes to -4.3% in RT, and overall to +3%. \n  \nNot a big practical difference either way - I just don't like seeing averages just being applied blindly!"

    "selftext": "I am on this boat. But every week that goes by, I see myself close to jumping off from it.   \n\n\nI will give some thoughts and I would be happy to be proven wrong, and that the 7700/7800 are worth the wait, but I am finding it hard to justify. Here we go:  \n\n\n1. The upper tier of RX 6000 cards are being priced very aggressively as of lately. Namely the 6800XT and the 6950XT. Besides, we pretty much know that whatever price/performance ratio the 7700 and 7800 offer at launch, it is unlikely the beat the discounted 6000 cards. The 7600 vs 6600XT/6650XT was a good example of that.  \n\n2. Free Premium Starfield. That is a $100 game being offered with upper tier RX 6000 cards and we can't tell for sure whether it will be offered with the 7700/7800 cards. These cards are unlikely to be released before Starfield is (which is just 7 weeks away). Moreover, 2023 has been an incredible year for gaming - arguably the best year out of the last 5 years, if not longer. Some are suggesting it is the best year for gaming ever. That might be a stretch. Regardless, each month of this year that goes by without a GPU upgrade, well, it kinda sucks.  \n\n3. RDNA3 offers no significant technological improvement over RDNA2, other than a small performance/watt gain. FSR3 will work for both. Memory (a strong selling point for AMD) won't improve either: the 7800/XT will offer the same memory capacity as the 6800/XT.  \n\n4. AMD is not necessarily under pressure. Their stocks are doing pretty well - the only time in history they were higher was during the peak of the mining boom. Nowadays AI is where the money is. GPUs for gaming is not AMD's top priority, whether we like it or not.",
    "comments": [
      "Your point 4 is incorrect.\n\nThey are under pressure. IP that has been developed and productized needs to make a ROI. Every month it waits, is another month that AMD is losing out on revenue.\n\nIt is likely that AMD is trying to get rid of its 6xxx stock.\n\nBut yeah, I wouldnt wait. The deals are too good right now.",
      "Is the cheapest, on sale RX 7900xtx still $900+?\n\nThen I have no trouble waiting.",
      "I was considering waiting, but looking their product stack and their pricing, there's literally nothing they could release that would be better then a 4070 for me.\n\nI would pretty much need to get a 7900xt performance wise, but using less power, for the price of a 4070, to want to give up the ray tracing performance, DLSS, cuda, reflex, and other nice Nvidia features. Those features really put in work and I'm tired of getting second class support all in the effort of raster performance. We're well past the point of raster being the only thing that matters, I'd happily give up 10-15% or more of my performance if it meant the card was better in all other aspects, and unfortunately that's the position I'm in with Nvidia and AMD.\n\nThis coming from someone currently on a 5700XT. When I bought that card over a 2070 super, ray tracing and DLSS were jokes. But if I could know how much better they were gonna get in the future I would have happily spent more on the 2070s.\n\nThat, and AMD's pricing here in Canada sucks right now anyways and I couldn't get a 6950XT for anywhere close to the price of a 4070 even if I did want that card, which I don't.",
      "What are you even talking about?\n\n> *nothing* is standard except the VRAM config\n\nThey are literally all the exact same card and will perform within 5% of each other, the only difference is the coolers and the warranty. \n\nPaying extra for better overbuilt coolers is stupid, you won’t get any better performance.",
      "I can understand someone not wanting the 6950xt due to the high power consumption, but the 6800xt is much more reasonable, and is appearing at or below $500 right now. Not much point in waiting. I got mine for $479 a couple months ago.",

I'm in a similar boat as OP's except I'm waiting on a bit of money to come in which I will use to make a purchase and I've been crossing my fingers for a 7700xt release. Really didn't want to buy 2+ year old hardware. Sigh",
      "> Really didn't want to buy 2+ year old hardware. Sigh\n\nTheres always pros and cons to buying brand new hardware. 7000 drivers were a mess at launch and it took months to fix them. Meanwhile, 6000 series drivers have been stable for well over a year. Another example, when I got my 5900x and x570 mobo in late 2020 (when 5000 series cpus launched), my ram wouldnt run at the frequency advertised (3600 mhz) without my system crashing like crazy. I had to run it at 3200 for over 6 months until there was a bios update that fixed it. So I ended up losing performance and paid for something I couldnt fully use for 6+ months. New tech is almost always overpriced at and around launch too.\n\nI get the allure of buying the brand new, shiny thing, but is it really that big of a deal to buy 2+ year old hardware? When you go car shopping, do you only look at the 2023 models and ignore everything 2021 and earlier? Even if you get most of the performance/features for a lot less money? What about TVs or monitors? The latest lg c3 is 25% more money than a c2 and has marginal performance increases at best. Most would say it's a waste of money to buy the c3 over the c2. \n\nI just think we need to change our mentality when it comes to these things. You shouldnt feel bad because youre buying something thats a couple years old. Especially when that thing thats a couple years old is priced well and is a big performance increase to whatever youre currently using.",

With the 'low' price of the 7600 there is plenty of room to price these competitively - but I somehow have very low hopes.\n\nAMD can only really go for value with either card, since their price to performance is capped by the generationally rather mediocre 7900XT(X).\n\nMy guess is it'll be another very underwhelming release that's not going to excite anybody for AMD who isn't already, and disappoint those who already are. :D",

Support for all three upscaling technologies, and FSR lagging behind in image quality - which is the only option for the 5700 XT as it doesn't support XeSS due to not having DP4a.\n\n2.

He ended up getting a 5700XT.\n\nThat said, the driver issues were definitely real: his computer crashed randomly ~once a week, even *months* after the original launch. Those issues magically disappeared at some point, after a driver update I assume.\n\nAlso, Turing ended up aging better than expected in a way. DLSS was a complete joke of a feature until v2.1/2.2 in 2021, and was supported only by a handful of games until 2022+.

They have a massive advantage in RT...at the ultra high end. You need to spend $600+ to get a playable RT experience (4070 up) at 4K60, and AMD can't get anywhere close close to Nvidia's RT perf at $800 (4070 Ti Super) or above.\n\nHowever, the lower you go down the stack, the better AMD's RT is relative to Nvidia.

      "No great. Not terrible. Everyone will just wait for the inevitable price drops. Or AMD will change the price last minute anyway.\n\nDrop $50 and it’s probably a good deal.",
      "The 6800xt goes for $480-520 now, has a higher timespy score according to leaks, and they're trying to sell the 7800 at $550 with no significant extra features, atleast Nvidia's new cards have DLSS 3. This is DOA until price drops like the 7600.",
      "Genuine question, is anyone here getting GPU upgrades every generation? I just upgraded from my 1070ti and I don't plan on getting a new one for atleast 5 years.",
      "Normal people don't upgrade every gen. \n\nBut reddit is a small town, so most intense people are very vocal in here.\n\nIf you come from old gens is fine to upgrade",
      "They need to sell some to the \"whales\" first.  Then when they're had their fill and stop buying, AMD will have to drop the prices.  By the time that happens the free Starfield deal will probably be long over, but maybe Fall Zipfest will come around again.",
      "AMD and nVidia have effectively set up a duopoly. It seems like AMD isn't willing to compete for market share.",
      "So the 7800 is a slightly more expensive 6800XT. A whole new process node and R&D for...AV1 encoding I guess?",
      "The name isn’t important. The price and performance is what matters. If a 7800 is the same or slightly better than a 6800xt for $499, with some newer features and more efficiency, then that’s a pretty good offering, and a good improvement over previous gen price to performance.\n\nAt $549 it’s not BAD, it’s just not that exciting.",
      "We need a better competitor than AMD in the GPU market. AMD just doesn't care.",
      "Neither of these prices are competitive enough, AMD just seems to be following the same trend again, price just close just to Nvidia to “seem” better. \n\nIMO they need to be way more aggressive if they have any intention to capture market share. But even 400 for 7700 isn’t looking exactly great when the leaked/rumored benches say 15% better than 4060Ti and having 12GB VRAM, while the public sees DLSS, Frame Generation and RT as better on Nvidia. And that’s ignoring the previous gen market prices.",
      "The issue is price drops generally only happen in USA, in other places prices can be quite sticky. Which is quite sad, Nvidia on the hand is just giving an even larger FU to consumers making AMDs dirt bag money squeezing look like a good deed.",
      "Well not exactly whales, but if there’s just some fraction of people out there willing to buy at 550, selling at 500 at launch could mean fewer profits.",
      "you are comparing the wrong product and the wrong time. \n\n6800XT launched at $649 while 6800 was $580.\n\nthis 7800 non-XT will be lower than both at launch for $550.",
      "Used will always be cheaper than new. Is this a new concept to you? If new was 399, used would drop to 299. The marketplace decides the price given time."

From everything I've seen:\n\n\\-7800XT offering 6800XT performance for $100 cheaper is apparently a great deal but 4070 offering 3080 performance for $100 cheaper is a ripoff.\n\n\\-RT is still a gimmick only worth using in several games and no one actually cares about it\n\n\\-Frame gen is trash and no one cares about it\n\n\\-FSR is \"good enough\" therefore you don't need DLSS\n\n\\-12GB VRAM is only good for 1080p. If you have an 8GB card you miles well use it as a doorstop at this point.\n\nIf all of that was true AMD would have a 50%+ market share in the GPU space right now. Then you go look at the real world and realize that the PC gaming market is generally pretty enthusiast skewed where people do care about new features like RT, good upscaling, and frame gen and Nvidia happens to dominate in all of those aspects atm.",

They're more efficient but the 7800x3d was already a leap ahead of the regular 7000 chips for efficiency anyways. If you don't wanna wait for the 9800x3d I'd go ahead for the 7800x3d.",

With the 5800X3D and the 3090 I average over 120 FPS in the same maps. It was a massive improvement. But that game uses the Unity engine and that engine benefits massively from increased cache. Some other game engines do not see as drastic of an improvement. Some others do.\n\nSo it depends on what you play and if you are targeting very high FPS. If you have a mid range GPU I think you probably made the right choice."

Now you might say, I don't care I'll upgrade my motherboard with my CPU in three, four, or maybe five years from now, but the point is, when performance and price are virtually identical, you have to look at other factors, and when doing so the fact is the 7600X is on a superior platform, it does consume less power, and it is easier to cool despite its love for the 95 degree TJ-max.

And for MCM configurations, the 7700XT is a low-end configuration - too low to see the benefits in cost scaling, but still incurs penalties for performance overhead/power and uses more total silicon.  Really arguably N31 should have been the starting point for MCM configurations, that seems to be the lowest point where it makes sense as a design tradeoff right now.  N32 would have been better off monolithic (it can't be a contender in laptops without being monolithic tbh)\n\nKnock 10% off the price and It's Fine.  I honestly didn't think they'd be willing to go this low but yeah, $350 is fine for what it is.\n\n7700XT is another example of a perfectly Fine card that's gotten caught up in the hysteria around this whole generation (from both brands), just like the 7600XT.  At $350 you are paying maybe a 10% perf/$ premium for RDNA3 over RDNA2, and that is a bet that I'm willing to take especially in the low-end market.  5nm > 7nm, better RT, better AI (opening the door for a proper DLSS competitor), guaranteed Antilag+ support, etc etc.  The value of the newer thing isn't zero, and perf/$ isn't the same thing as value.  For a bet of maybe $30 of actual value, I'll take the newer thing.\n\nIt's gonna be fine folks, RDNA2 inventory will eventually sell through and open a gap for RDNA3 prices to slide downwards a bit too.  And at that point the 7600XT/7700XT/etc will be utterly Fine.\n\nAMD is learning the same lesson NVIDIA did the hard way after the 2018 mining crash - in a world of slowing progress, letting clearance sales get too out-of-hand will lead to a wave of bad reviews and salty consumers.  Locking in the value of those clearance sales isn't good enough for people anymore, and even if you adjust the prices later (like 2070S) people will stay butthurt about the whole generation forever.  If people continue being weird about clearance sales, if reviewers continue blasting every product in every generation for \"the clearance-priced thing is better!\", the obvious answer is to not have clearance sales.  AMD doesn't have to provide MDF or discounts at the end of the gen to get things gone, they can just wait for it to sell through like NVIDIA does.  Be careful what messages you're *really* signaling.",

That alone is reason enough to go with the 7700XT, so do that, \n\n12GB or 16 GB VRAM is not going to matter this generation, and even when it will matter, a 7600XT is unlikely to be fast enough for it to matter. That 8GB is not enough in some cases now is because of some games being heavily optimized for the consoles, and the weakest (Xbox Series S) can access 10GB from the GPU. It will be slower for the last 2GB, but it can do that, so some games optimize their texture sets against that. That kills performance on 8GB cards. As long as the Series S is supported, 12GB will be enough - and when it isn’t, a 7600XT is too slow anyway.",

I’m sure AMD WANTS to put something in that lower gap, but I’m not sure what that card is. A third tier Navi 32 is of course an option, but the confusing pricing of the 7700XT (and quite frankly, the stupid naming of the entire lineup) makes me think that they don’t want to price any of their chiplet designs any lower for whatever reason - more likely capacity than cost, but it could be either.\n\nFaster Navi 33 seems unlikely as the boost clock is already the highest in the lineup.

You can get 8gb of gddr6 for $25 pretty much and this happened around June 2023. With the lead time to a product launch, the August release of the 7700xt was likely planned prior to these prices collapsing.\n\n2. Yields of the dies are good enough AMD wants to up the CUs. It could also be AMD found 60 CUs at lower clocks is perfectly stable, so there's no need to cut down to 54 when they could sell 60 just at a lower clock speed.\n\nSo, there are at least two reasons I see for this that make sense."

      "MSRP + $100 incoming...",
      "Just please keep them as close to MSRP as possible. Especially the white because we all know there is usually a ridiculous added charge on white gpus",
      "Jake,\n\nA 850W PSU is recommended for the 7800XT...is that a mistake?\n\nWhen will the clock speeds be announced?\n\nThanks.",
      "1. The cards look great,  but tbh they need to stay as close to MSRP as possible,  or else they're DOA.   \n2. The white model looks the best in my opinion, but I don't like the yellowish logos.   \n3. A giveaway would be a good way to connect with consumers and give back to the community.  Just saying ;)",
      "Considering that the Suggested PSU for 7900 XT is 700W (750W in the ASUS PSU Table), that should be a huge overestimation.",
      "If they cost 10% more than MSRP then they're not worth it",
      "This, unfortunately. White is a real pain and challenge to get the color matching perfectly. Black blends better but white shows everything and even a slightly different hue can be apparent.",
      "We should have pricing soon and I’ll update when we do. Part of why we’ve targeted the TUF series was to help keep prices a bit more reasonable compared to some other options.",
      "That seems like an oversight to me OR that the article was written prior to actually receiving confirmed numbers, which is likely. I’ll pass this along. Like u/poppoo143 mentioned, the higher tier card already states a lower wattage psu.",
      "Personally I feel like the TUF Gaming line as a whole is missing on an opportunity to distance itself from \"gaming\" and be a sleeker more minimalist brand (as it is your cheaper option). I think at this point the whole \"gaming\" marketing in the computer component world is very oversaturated and as of today you could go as far as calling it \"gimicky.\" I'm a gamer, I don't need my components to say it on them. I'm aware I can game on my GPU and Mobo, that is what I bought it for after all. You already have the ROG brand, the TUF Gaming brand is starting to = cheaper asus brand, more than just gaming computer components which I think was the original intention when TUF Gaming launched.\n\nSimply put, if I were the VP of marketing I'd drop \"Gaming\" from \"TUF\" and try to capitalize on the anti-rgb movement and have it be a minimalist, sleek line and pivot from the \"cheap, downgraded ROG\" line that it has become synonymous with. Kind of like pro-art, but again not targeting any specific group. Let's be real, it's not like the consumer hardware itself would physically change if gaming was the focus or not. No board partner made \"mining\" focused hardware brands for example. Your Pro-art GPU dies aren't any different from your TUF or ROG brands.\n\nI would never buy Asus TUF Gaming branded products new unless they were steeply discounted, which is almost never the case, because I assume they're just intentionally built worse than they could be and usually they're not priced as such. And conversely I'd never buy your Strix brand new because I assume that the relative performance increase doesn't align with the price increase. Maybe what I'm asking for is to merge TUF and Pro-art into an economy brand, that is a general economy brand, priced at the bottom of the stack that doesn't feel \"gimicky and intentionally cheaper.\" Like a brand I'd buy for myself and not my 8 year old nephew because he can't have nice things yet. A big part of the problem is the Strix line is infamously overpriced at this point so it makes the TUF Gaming line seem way worse than it is.\n\nYour competitors do a much better job of differentiating and blending their brand tiers in my opinion. Take MSI for example, they have the ventus, Gaming trio & Suprim cards. When I think of the two Asus brands I think of intentionally worse thus overpriced gaming, and very overpriced, high quality gaming. MSI? Ventus is cheap and crappy, gaming trio is more expensive but performs to that bump while establishing a middle ground and then suprim is splurge. Not to say Strix doesn't compete with Suprim, but there's no middle ground for Asus and the juxtaposition between TUF and ROG is too big and obvious. MSI boards? I couldn't even tell you how that branding works, but all I know is they're not clearly pitted against each other as cheap vs overpriced. And Asus mobos still aren't out of the woods from voltage-gate from a public perception standpoint. ASRock? Same story as MSI, unique branding, no \"gaming\" overkill and sensible tiering.",
      "It’s actually not ridiculous for white to be a more expensive color. It is harder to get good yields on white injection molded parts and painted parts. Which means either parts are rejected and then scrapped or reworked. In either case that leads to more money be necessary to make a unit. The auto industry does similar. The white colors tend to be an up charge color.",
      "Recommended means nothing dude. I have a 850w psu for my 7900xtx. You're 750w psu is more than enough.",
      "Bro 3080 10GB is arguably the worst to get right now, the 7800xt will probably match its performance or slightly supersede with 6GB more vram for proper 2k or 4k textures in the near future. \n\nThese recommendations are really meant for typical buyers who usually have shitty Psu ... for example a noname 850w psu (such as that infamous series from Gigabyte) cannot match a solid 650w from FSP. Hence, they have to inflate these recommendation numbers in case some dumb ass uses these no name psus\n\nJust have a solid 650-700w and you should be fine with these mid range gpu",
      "I would like to know whether the coolers are repurposed nvidia ones or not. Some ASUS radeon cards have coolers designed for nvidia models, probably to save cost of development idk.",
      "Haha giveaways aren’t off the table though my personal preference is to first have some open and honest dialogue. Giveaways can muddy the waters on feedback and honest discussion.\n\nThanks for the feedback on the cards!",
      "Car paint =/= plastic parts for GPU.\n\nAlso white color isn't always the cheapest for cars, sometimes you need to pay extra for white.",
      "Yeah, ASUS GPUs are notoriously overprices to point I just pretend they dont exist. I like ProArt series with more reasonably sized coolers for motherboards with dual x8/x8. But again 2.7 slot sized cooler is going to kill any GPU with 2nd expansion card if it bit longer than wifi which you never put into x8 slot anyway. Usually HBA cards or 2nd GPU or high end 40G fiber NIC that actually needs the lanes.",
      "I like the rgb, it's not over the top. Looking at an 7800xt for a friend just waiting on availability and price in NZ, really happy with my tuf xtx",
      "I liked the older TUF Sabertooth(X99/Z87/990FX etc.) aesthetic more than the more recent yellow TUF design. Seems like a massive downgrade.   \nROG/Strix lines seem super upcharged while being hit-or-miss quality wise.",
      "I run a 6800xt with a 850w and its nowhere near maxing it out plus 6800 xt is less efficient compared to a 7800xt."

    "title": "I get the controversy behind the mislabeling of the 7900/7800 series but why is the 7700 XT getting the same hate?",
    "selftext": "I'm seeing numerous posts on here saying that the 7700 XT is really just a 7700 or even a 7600 XT class card. Heck, even the 7600 is not spared although I think it performs fine as a 6600 successor. Are people just parroting what others online are saying?\n\nLet me break it down for you:\n\n* Architecture: They are both Nx2 classes (N32 vs N22)\n* Memory Capacity: Both 12GB\n* Memory Bus Width: 192 bit\n\nBut that's where the similarities end. It is much closer to a 6800 non-XT than it is to the 6700 XT\n\n||RX 7700 XT|RX 6700 XT|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Core Count|54 CU|40 CU|\n|Boost Clock Speed|2544 MHz|2424 MHz|\n|TDP|245W|230W|\n|MSRP|$449|$479|\n\nIMO, it a worthy successor to the 6700 XT and at a $30 discount, bringing much more features and significant performance uplift.\n\nIf anything that the 7700 XT should be guilty of is that it is priced too high or too close to the 7800 XT.\n\n**EDIT:** Again I want to clarify, not spotlighting the price (that is a separate debate), it's that people won't stop labeling it as a 7700/7600 XT. Even if they do label it as a 7700, people will complain the price is too high, but the performance would be greatly above its predecessor (6700).",
    "comments": [
      "Yeah it seems good but people are pissed it's priced so close to the 7800 XT. I think a $70-80 difference would set them apart better (either increasing one or decreasing the other).",
      "GN nailed it - at $50 gap it's not worthwhile, at $100 it's extremely compelling.",
      "You can't really compare release MSRPs because the 6700XT is now selling for $330.   \nPeople are disappointed that the 7700Xt is priced at $450 because the 7800XT is \\~20% better and 11% more expensive, essentially funneling everyone toward a higher price bracket.   \n\n\nThe 7700XT doesn't really fill a meaningful position in AMD's GPU lineup right now, at the $450 price point.",
      "Because if they released it at $400 they'd have the $330 6700xt and $350 3750xt collecting dust. Inevitably the 6000 GPUs will sell out and the 7700xt price will drop to $400 or less. Sucks but if they got stock to move they're going to price it around making it move. \n\nBasically where it sits now pushes people up to 7800XT or pushes them down to a 6750 or 6700. Once the bottom of this tier falls out (6000 series sold out and done), the price of the 7700Xt falls in response. Its pretty basic business and is done with almost every product you buy that has recurring releases.",
      "I live in Europe, and the price gap is actually roughly €100 here. The 7700 XT retails for around €520-550 and the 7800 XT is around €620-650, depending on XFX/Sapphire/Asus etc. (including all taxes and stuff).",
      "Yeah, people easily forgot what happened just a generation ago. if 7800XT is really priced that good then keep saying that 7700 should drop in price, can't the opposite also happen in which the 7800xt might actually increase in price? \n\ni am in a region where GPU prices tend to stick to what is release price and dont decrese BUT will actually increase in price if its always sold",
      "So AMD should just raise 7800xt prices! \n/s",
      ">Are people just parroting what others online are saying?\n\nthey're all saying the same thing because it's true, why would you buy the 7700 XT when you could get the bigger 7800 XT for just $80 more?\n\n$80 is a small gap for the current GPU economy today, and it's certainly better than the $170 difference between the 6700 XT vs 6800 XT.\n\nthe 7800 XT is not only faster, it also has 16GB of VRAM, quite a few RT cores and should only draw like 50-60watts more.\n\nthe 7700 XT is not a bad card, I've not seen anyone say that anywhere. it's position in the market is just weird.\nhere's hoping for a price cut for the 7700 XT.",
      "Then why would you ever buy a 7800xt or 7700xt when 6800xt is 500 brand new.",
      "If 7800xt rises more in price, then there is less actual incentive to chooce 7800xt over 4070 so i doubt it will go that way if amd is smart.",
      "What a level-headed take",
      "Mindfactory sold many 7800 xt units for 559€, sadly other countries tend to get screwed with pricing.",
      "So AMD should raise 6800xt prices too!!",
      "It's even more pointless to compare it to heavily discounted 6800xt cards, that will disappear from the market in a few weeks. \nThe 7600 was compared to the 6700 10GB discounted to sub $300, which never had many cards on sale to begin with.",
      "Not everyone makes purchasing decisions from the mindset of \"what is the absolute maximum amount of money I can possibly spend?\"\n\nI could afford a 4090, but there's no chance Nvidia is getting $1,600 out of me. I could afford a 7950X3D, but it would be a waste. If the price:performance is close, yeah, I'll eat a bit of value for more performance (say, 30% more performance for 40% more money). However, with stuff like the 7700 XT and 7800 XT, it's easy to fit another $50 in the budget.\n\nHeck, there are times I'm debating between going all-out for a top-tier product to keep for a long time or getting something with much better value and upgrading more frequently.\n\nThat said, neither of these cards really does it for me. If the 7800 XT were $50 cheaper, I'd maybe get it. The 7700 XT needs to be more like $80-100 cheaper, IMO. If the 7800 XT comes down a bit for Black Friday, I might pick it up, but the 7700 XT has to be stupidly good value to convince me it's enough of an upgrade from my 5700 XT AND that I shouldn't just buy a 7800 XT for a little more.",
      "You can't really compare \"is now selling for\" prices either.\n\nA 6700 XT here (Philippines) is still $460. However, a 6750 XT is $440 - because the retailers got newer stock for it at a lower price. It used to be $540. It's also why a 6950 XT is cheaper than a 6800 XT.",
      "I'm so fuckin confused why every outlet insists on basing their review on MSRP and not *performance*. In 6 months none of their conclusions will make sense because the prices have shifted. \n\nI mean go watch everyone's reviews of 6700 XT or 6800 XT etc from last year. They all shit on it for being too expensive, and some even *re-reviewed* it after prices normalized. \n\nPeople use your recommendations well after launch. Like years later even. Including MSRP as a consideration is absolutely pointless beyond mentioning its current price. Because when you watch it a year later for a recommendation, suddenly the videos telling you to not buy a perfectly good card because they think it's not a good deal.",
      "Higher? The 7800xt is at the highest price to make sense at all, any higher price and the 6800xt gets a far better alternative...\nIt should be named the 7800 and the 7700xt should be a bit less. I'm sure prices will go down a bit soon, but for now Amd again somewhat fuck up the lunch with the naming and will get hate again.",
      "All that matters is current relative prices. Why would you buy a 6700xt when 6750xt is cheaper or 6800xt when 6950xt is cheaper. \n\nJust like why would we buy a 7800xt when 6800xt is cheaper. \n\nMsrp doesnt matter what matters is new avaliablity prices.  \n\nJust look back at 30 series and 6000 series releases. Msrp didnt mean a thing.",
      "Yeah, I live in Sweden and our taxes are pretty high (and our currency is kind of crap right now) so that may explain the slightly higher prices. Still, the difference between the 7700/7800 is roughly €100ish (depending on board partner)"

AIO's where on sale during the time of my purchase.\n\n6. I do look on my big ass screen given that I placed all of my PC components on my table. Kinda overkill I know.\n\n7. Bought the 7700 from one of my buddies. 150 bucks for a 7700 is a no brainer for me. I also use an Ultrawide monitor. Not really seeing that much of a  reason to go 7800x3d if my 3080 ti is already maxed.\n\n8. I feel that the 100 to 150  bucks going to aesthetics is a worthwhile investment given that it serves a decoration in my room and  this is also my work PC. Might as well have something nice to stare during my Work.\n\nBut I do understand where you're coming from.",

      ">as the SKU stuff is just guesswork by the writer.\n\nThey do this every fucking time!  And every time, everybody in the comments just eats it up unquestioningly.  So frustrating. \n\nThe actual GPU die specs are correct, we basically know this by now.  But how AMD decides to segment out the rest of the lineup is very much up in the air.  There's several different ways they could go about it.",
      "They were dead as soon as we saw the very credible Angstronomics article about the specs of Navi 31/32/33 and saw that not only was Navi 33 still gonna be using a 7nm-family process node, but it would only be 200mm² in size, rather than the \\~350mm² or so many were predicting(though even that might still not have been enough).  \n\nIt was immediately obvious that there was no way such a small GPU was gonna punch that high.  RDNA3 architecture(minus TSMC 5nm) would have needed to have been a *miraculous* leap in performance efficiency to achieve that.",

      "There's no way the 7700 XT is gonna be on navi33 with 32 CUs as the article suggests. Angstronomics said that navi33 is mobile first and only outperforms the A770 which means it's gonna be at the level of a 6650 XT. Plus your average consumer is gonna look at the 8 GB VRAM of the \"7700 XT\" and compare to the 6700 XT and see the card as a downgrade.\n\nAnd even if you ignore all the above and just do the math, navi33 with 1/3 the CUs of a 7900 XTX is never gonna outperform the 6800 XT even if it throws power efficiency out the window",
      "As long as it eclipses the 6800XT by a decent amount, uses less power, and costs less.\n\nAlso, drivers need to be solid on release.",
      "if you think 15% improvement in 2 years at the same price it's good, well that's a problem.\n\nmaybe because there is a lot of people like you out there the companies letting themselves keep raising prices like crazy and give us poor value for money",

They're trying to clearance out the last generation cards.\n\nGPU's are mostly priced according to their performance in the market, and the 7700 XT can be produced for cheaper than the 6800 but performs about the same.\n\nThus, AMD wants to replace the 6800 with the 7700 XT (more profit at a similar market price). Since performance/$ is almost always increasing over time, the longer they take to sell 6800's, the lower the profits.\n\nIf you buy a 6800 over a 7700 XT and think you're pulling a fast one on AMD, you're wrong.",

By the time FSR 3 comes out DLSS 3.0 will have matured and have made its way into games, basically meaning FSR 3.0 is probably going to have the same issue as previous iterations—adoption rate. Next problem will be RT performance, power consumption, content creation, and probably pricing to compete. \n\nAs seen with the comparison between the 4070Ti and 7900XT, rasterization performance alone isn’t going to sell a lot of cards, feature sets are going to dictate what card has better value. \n\nI had high hopes for AMD with the 7xxx series, but when I see basically normal generational steps up with their lineup while not pushing the envelop and charging high prices, it really disheartened me. \n\nNvidia, while still expensive, saw some nice gains, especially in the 4070Ti, while also bringing out a much more robust feature set at launch, and nailing the power consumption, unlike AMD that just keeps promising, is why I chose Nvidia this time around. \n\nC’mon AMD, innovate! Quit copying Nvidia while being late to the party. You only get one first impression and they seriously need to up their game in that department.",
      "Yeah. I feel like there's WAAAAY too much gaslighting on hardware subs on this site over high GPU prices. \n\nI mean, if they sell, you got the free market bootlickers going \"well ackshuilly they're selling so that means the prices are justified\", but if you point out low demand and them cutting back stock to keep prices high, people just find another nonsense argument to push.\n\nIt's like way too many people are trying to contort themselves into pretzels to justify these crap prices.\n\nAnd then they're like \"well ackshully its just out of your budget\", YEAH NO CRAP! The current prices are insane, and the lowest RDNA 2 discounted cards are the only ones that remotely approach what i consider a fair pricing. \n\nSeriously, it wasn't long ago when the top end GPU was like $500. Then suddenly it was $700. And then it was $1000. And then $1200. And then $1600. \n\nIt's insane. \n\nHeck, I remember in the late 2000s you could get like a 9800 GTX for like $250 or something. \n\nI remember my first GPU being a $80 3650 and my first \"REAL\" GPU being a 5850 for like $300 or something.\n\nAnd that was like the fourth strongest single card on the market at the time, only below the 5870, 470, and 480. \n\nI mean I remember when the market had like several tiers of products in the $100-200 price range alone.

That would mean they are pushing the frequency target for the 7700 way higher than the 7800, which is the opposite that usually happens on cut down cards. Often they are also sold as lower chips because they can't hit frequency targets.\n\nThe 260w lines up more with the 7900 GRE,  and 245W with a full 60 cu 7800 with a N32 die pushed to it's limit.

Its existence is making the 3060,3070,3080,7600,7700,7800 and even 4070 kind of redundant unless you care for RT performance. Current amd gpu gen is looking so pointless, at these prices, unless you are going for a 7900xt or 7900xtx.

AMD no longer has a **90 competitor, yet they've reintroduced the XTX SKU for some reason. RX 7000 GPUs have all the downsides of being MCM products with none of the benefits. They don't even have a dual GCD product to show for it. I really hope it pays off, because this generation seems like a flop architecturally.",

That's around the price of a 6800, but with less VRAM. Plus you can find 6800s for $430, which is the maximum this card should have been. AMD probably saw how bad the 4060s were and got a little too confident.",
      "On AMD's own slides the 7800XT is 20% faster than a 7700XT for 11% more. There is definitely something weird going on like yields are really good, so they are making many more 7800XT and don't really want to sell 7700XT???",
      "Its probably both cards cost a similar amt to make, like the 7900xt/xtx, and they want to push folks into the more expensive SKU. In a few months, the 7700xt will be down to 399.",

      ">$450 for the 7700 XT is bad.\n\n7700xt is clearly there to upsell 7800xt and would likely be disounted later like 7900xt was.\n\nHonestly 7800xt seems like an amazing 1440p card  after their FSR3 presentation that will last years. Both need independant testing though.",
      "The whole point is to upsell 7800xt, yes, to be discounted later. Atleast 7800xt looks amazing unlike 7900xtx for its price as long as FSR3 lives up to DF expectations.",

      "It's terrible.  Why is the 7700XT so expensive😭 I hope half a month goes by and the price drops to at least 400€... My RX580 is about to die, I can't wait anymore, I want to play starfield...",

It has AI cores that would be needed for future iterations of FSR and therefore those cards would last longer than 6000 series despite their similar raster performance right now.\n\nThat's objective. 'Upscaling looks horrible' and 'Fake Frames are not real frames' are subjective.",

But then again most of the fanbois are, no matter the brand, right? It's just that the leather jacket man is perhaps too good of a cult leader.\n\nEDIT: Harsh truth is that this whole GPU gen is a mess. That is ofc partly due to previous crypto craze & insane GPU prices.\n\nWhat saddens me most are two things. Nvidia being so dominant to the point of making extra sure as not to provide \"too much\" of performance at each perf tier while also skimping on VRAM. \n\nAnother thing is AMD super closely following Nvidia's greedy price scheme and trying to give as low discount as possible to remain interesting choice.\n\nI think that if at least ONE of these factors improved drastically, it would be so good for gamers in general.

Instead, it's a similar-powered card for less money.\n\nEven then, it's generous to consider. It's around the same price the 6800 XT is selling for now. Where we'd expect a new GPU roughly a year after launch, the 7800 XT is launching almost 3 years after the 6800 XT.

It only suffers from shimmering of distant objects compared to DLSS, not in terms of texture or detail reconstruction. It does fine details really well, like power lines, fences, gates, grills vs TAA.\n\nIf FSR2 iteration fix shimmering, to me, there's no real advantage to XeSS or DLSS2 anymore.",
      "Well the issue with AMD is consistency. They have years of having the \"bad driver\" stigma, hardware that runs extremely hot, consumes a lot of power, etc. They finally latched onto something good with the Vega series but never put much into it, then released RDNA with the 5700XT which was a great performer plagued with serious teething issues for quite some time. Then finally got it right with the 6000-series with an awesome performance to the dollar ratio, but then they released the 7000-series which strayed away from what was getting them there by trying to price match Nvidia at the outset, while not offering the consumers anything extra bona-fide features like DLSS, FG, or Reflex, and learned really quickly what the market is willing to bear considering their market share and had to drop prices, but only after it was too late. To add, yes, I know FSR 2.2 is decent, but it's available for all GPU's, meaning it's not an AMD only feature, and it's inferior to DLSS so I wouldn't even bring it up when talking about feature sets. The only worthwhile feature on the AMD side is SAM, but even so, it's not a real selling point. \n\nNvidia can afford a misstep because they've time and time again over 25 years have shown that for every misstep follows a series of great GPU's, and while they've had their fair share of controversies, the numbers never lied hence why they've maintained a solid lead for quite some time now. People call it mind share, well yes, it is mindshare when you're known for consistently releasing quality products while your competitors are hit or miss. Average Joe's don't want to fuck around and gamble with hundred's if not a thousand dollar purchase by going with AMD, they'd rather go with Nvidia because of the reputation, which is the same reason people just buy iPhones over Samsung's or whatever other top Android brand there is, reputation. \n\nI agree though on the everyone wanting to make excuses for AMD. Being an avid AMD user myself, and having owned the last three generations of GPU's from AMD I used every excuse under the sun from price to performance, to VRAM, to power consumption to justify buying a 6700XT over a 3070/Ti. It only occurred to me when I went back to Nvidia with my 4070Ti that I was an idiot for trying to justify a poor purchasing decision, not saying the 6700XT was bad, but the 3070 is a better overall GPU when considering the whole package. While yes, you can make the argument that I could have gone with the \"technically\" better 7900XT, at the time the cost difference between the two was $135 in favor of the 4070Ti, and in hindsight, the sheer amount of features alone would have still pulled me over to team green even if the two were priced similarly. \n\nAMD's niche is VRAM, they slap a ton of it on their GPU's, but unfortunately once we get to the point to where 12GB isn't enough for 1440p or below, people will be looking at the 60-series/9000 series GPU's, and that 20GB on the 7900XT or 24GB on the 7900XTX won't mean shit except for being able to pump up texture quality, all the while Nvidia 40-series GPU's will still get by with it's feature set. I know a lot of people are probably going to start quoting FSR 3, but look, it has to be implemented into the game by the developer for it to properly work. If PureDark is anything to go by, DLSS and Frame Generation can easily be added without the developers needing to be involved and still work properly, unlike FSR 3, which means it is more readily available to the end consumer--which that right there automatically gives Frame Generation a big W. \n\nTo end this essay--AMD needs to invest in features, and embrace things like RT more seriously. While I won't say raw power isn't preferred, at the end of the day eventually that raw power isn't enough, and developers can only optimize so much, which is where feature sets, like you said, will be the deciding factor and something like DLSS, Reflex, and Frame Gen will easily be worth the extra cost, even if AMD's product offers better out of the box performance.",
      "Early bird gets the worm. Nvidia being the first to embrace RT, and temporal upscaling has been a tremendous boon for them. You'd think AMD would follow suit and invest more resources into combating DLSS, but they seem to be happy with what they have, but they forget that it's the consumers who they should be aiming at making happy, not just themselves. If AMD offered a serious competitor to DLSS that was on par, I'd seriously consider going back to using AMD. It's just their track record doesn't instill confidence in me, and their thing about making everything open source doesn't exactly help them when combating  Nvidia. People cite open source like it's some kind of bastion, but really it's more for hobbyists, the average consumer doesn't care about \"open source,\" they care about what's better. \n\nHow many folks are willing to jump through hoops, browse github, or spend hours on end improving on something when they can just buy a competing product that offers the best experience right out of the box? Ease of use and peace of mind are worth the couple hundred dollar differences.",

AM5 requires significantly stronger power delivery, bios capacity, and DDR5, all of which cost more.\n\nThere IS no 'equivalent' AM4 board.  There are none with similar power delivery either.    AM5 has SVI3,  AM4 has SVI2.   This means different power ICs and mosfets -- and these are not yet high enough volume to bring prices down.  (once Zen4 Epyc is ramped up and these have greater supply, it will lower costs quite a bit for AM5).  So you can't compare the # of phases of some AM4 board to an AM5 one and declare them the 'same'.  \n\nAre mobo manufacturers trying to take a larger cut?   Probably.   But there is competition, and when prices don't lower while there is sufficient competition, the reason must be either supply constraints or higher costs.\n\nIts a little of both here:  higher costs for DDR5 mobo traces/layers, higher costs for various power delivery components, and related supply issues for power ICs for those (that essentially keep costs higher).",

But of course both the entry-level Intel and AMD may lack PCIe 5 support, or only have it on NVMe, or other weird bullshit.\n\n(PS: it's easier to just select Socket: LGA1700 unless you want to filter for specific chipsets! ;)\n\nNow of course... does that really matter to users?  DDR4 is still very competitive in gaming and if it allows you to go with a cheaper CPU and a cheaper motherboard maybe that's not an awful decision for losing 5% here and there.  13600K is a very competitive CPU for the price, so is 5800X3D, and if you have memory already and maybe a motherboard then AM5 still looks like an overall bad deal even if \"it's got DDR5\".\n\nAnd Zen4's memory controller is *really fucking bad*, like it probably won't POST with 4 sticks unless they're single-rank and low-speed.  [wendell talks about it here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P58VqVvDjxo) but it's not really limited to 128GB, it's any dual-rank sticks, and even a lot of single-rank sticks don't do great with 4 slots, and you are going to significantly reduce available bandwidth (from 70GB/s with 2 sticks down to about 50GB/s - this is not insignificant). You are basically buying the ddr5 equivalent of the early super finicky b350 boards.\n\nHUB being HUB of course they completely shat on DDR5 for a year straight when it was Intel-exclusive, it *just isn't ready yet guys*, meaning AMD hadn't launched theirs yet, but the moment AM5 launched that was the moment DDR5 was ready and you were a big moron if you were still buying DDR4.  Truth be told it still is not ready yet, things haven't changed from july or august really other than AMD having their product out now (and it's much worse than Intel in terms of memory controller).  The launch gouging was winding down within a couple months, decent RAM came out within a couple months, but the AMD platform just isn't there yet.  \n\nWe will see what prices do in the future, AMD is supposedly designing their platform around smart power stages, which drives up the cost relative to AM4 (and LGA1700), and AMD is intent on selling you 2 chipsets even if they aren't needed (de facto this is just moneygrubbing from AMD - nobody actually connects more than 3 pcie slots even on a $1300 board, nobody really needs the expansion from the second chipset, it's just a way for AMD to capture a little more revenue selling you something that's hardly even used).  Prices may not come down as much as people are hoping, and when AMD says \"cheaper boards are coming\" what they most likely mean is A620, ie even shittier and worse boards, not so much that decent B650/X670 boards are going to come way down.\n\nEven as someone who is really into the idea of a AVX-512 + v-cache system, I'm really dubious about that memory controller and I think it's probably better to just wait a year and see what happens.  I expect 8000 series chips and better motherboards and lower prices will fix most of the complaints.",
      "No. Prices are basically the same from B660 and Z690 MSRP to B760 and Z790 MSRP. The pricing difference is mostly because 600 series is 'old' and thus is on sale now, despite being 95% as good. You can find more 700 series boards under $200 than you can AM5 board."

    "selftext": "[https://wccftech.com/rgt-radeon-rx-7800-xt-rx-7700-xt-rx-7600-xt-and-rx-7600-gpu-performance-targets-and-specs/](https://wccftech.com/rgt-radeon-rx-7800-xt-rx-7700-xt-rx-7600-xt-and-rx-7600-gpu-performance-targets-and-specs/)\n\nHonestly, those specs don't inspire confidence in team Red for me this go 'round if they're true. The 7800XT is seeing maybe a 25 -30% bump in performance in best case scenarios with better RT performance, and the 7700XT is probably seeing similar results, but when compared to their last gen-counterparts the 7700XT is probably looking more like a re-badged 6800 possibly XT, and the 7800XT is basically a re-badged 6950XT with better RT performance.\n\nThe only card in there that's worth noting is the 7800XT, it'll be almost comparable to a 4070Ti, which I just upgraded from 6700XT to. The 7700XT looks like it'll fall victim to the same fate as the 6700XT, priced in no-man's land with middling performance.\n\nI was talking to some friends earlier about this--for the 7800XT to even succeed it has to be priced \"realistically\" no higher than $650-$700 only because Nvidia is the go-to for a lot of gamers, AMD has a lot of ground to cover, and despite what some might say, Frame Generation is probably the best feature I've seen on a GPU in a long time; that and DLSS support sold me on switching sides for this gen. DLSS has been one of the features keeping Nvidia on top these past few gens, even against comparable AMD cards, and FSR just hasn't had the impact DLSS had, even being open source, the adoption rate and IQ combined versus DLSS has put it way behind.\n\nIt pains me to see how the x700 series being given the treatment it's getting. The 5700XT was such a great card, and the 6700XT improved upon it, but marginally, but still offered performance relative to a 2080Ti. The fact that the 7700XT might not even hit 6800XT levels of performance means this card is going to have to be realistically priced at $400-$450 for it to succeed, otherwise they're just handing Nvidia a victory this generation. The 4070, it's competition is going to be utilizing DLSS 3, and frame generation which is, in the eyes of the average consumer who doesn't understand tech but can read numbers is going to gravitate towards. The only thing that would push people to the 7700XT is if the 4070 is priced outrageously. Even then if Nvidia releases a 4060/Ti, it's probably going to eat the 7700XT's lunch in terms of sales.\n\nThe 7600XT is literally just a rebadge, plain and simple. Nothing to see here. :(\n\nSorry for the long post, but honestly the only card that piqued my interest from this gen would have been the 7700XT, but after pulling the trigger prematurely and getting the 4070Ti, honestly I'm happy I did. As much as it pains me to stray from team Red after six years,but I wanted something that was a step up from mid-range that would give me the option to play in 4k without spending over $1000, and I got the 4070Ti for $900 after sales taxes, which isn't bad for basically 3090Ti levels of performance, and about $132 less than what I would have gotten a sapphire/power color 7900XT. Was it pricey? Hell yes, but with it's performance level I'm easily seeing a good 3-4 years of usage from it, namely at 1440p.\n\nIt should be telling that the 4070Ti, despite it's price, is a card that AMD is going to have a tough time competing with considering it's nearest competitor, the 7900XT is only marginally better for $100-$150 more, and with the prices of the 7700/7800XT being unknown, AMD's got their hands full trying to figure a price that'll entice buyers. That's of course if these rumors are true.\n\nWhat do you guys think? You think AMD is on track, or do you think they blew their load a bit prematurely and forgot about the lower echelon of the RDNA3 cards?\n\nEdit: To clarify I was hoping and praying for AMD to pull a sucker punch on Nvidia and catch them off-guard to bring balance to the GPU market. I'm still hoping they do, or at least sell well, I would love to see AMD continue the trend of keeping Nvidia's pricing somewhat in check and maintaining decent performance, otherwise spending $900 on what can be viewed as mid-range will be nothing but a pipe dream in the years to come. I'm an AMD guy at the end of the day, even when the i7-2600k was god-tier I opted for AMD. ",

      "Thing is, here in Canada, a 6800s and above are pretty much non-existent, and what's n stock is priced close to a 7900XT, if not higher. It doesn't look much different with Nvidia cards. \n\nSo whereas theoretically the 6800XT and the 6900 cards are a better value at msrp, practically we don't see these prices nor stock available.",
      "I always love how posts reference retail prices like that doesn’t relate pretty much anywhere in the world other than the USA.",
      "AMD picked the wrong generation to invent the XTX SKU, because they can only really compete with Nvidia's (current) second-best. And that's ignoring the looming Ada Titan/4090 Ti.\n\nRemember when Navi 1 released? The highest model was the 5**7**00 XT, which was a clear indicator that it competed with the 20**7**0 (Super).\n\nLikewise, the 6**9**00 XT at least had a claim to fighting the 30**9**0 when it came to 1080p and 1440p without RT.\n\nBut the 7**9**00 XTX is only a match for the RTX 40**8**0 (which is significantly gimped compared to the 4090), and the RX 7**9**00 is hardly a match for the 40**7**0 **Ti**. Keep in mind that the RX 6**8**00 competed with the 30**7**0 **Ti**. I have no doubt that a 4080 Ti is coming as well.\n\nIt's clear that all RX 7000 products below the 7900 XTX are more gimped versions than they would have been, had AMD decided not to name that SKU as such. Navi 32 and 33 not having more Compute Units than their predecessors (like N31) combined with the name-fuckery means that AMD will have to offset core reductions on low & mid-range products with clock increases to try to have barely-not-stagnant performance. Truly a pathetic showing this generation. I hope for everyone's sake that most people outright reject these.",
      "When the entire launch from both Nvidia and AMD has been a massive disappointment so far (especially with pricing) why would we expect mid tier to be any better. It's gona be overpriced and undersupplied (as per Lisa Su). This generation is a lost cause!",

      "hey bud im not having a go at you personally, moreso the industry as a whole. Also the fact that retail even in the us, is not really a good indicator. So many of the Halo lines people acutally buy are no where near retail, just look at asus strix as an example.",
      "Same in Europe more or less.\n\nYou either buy overpriced new gen, or damn overpriced last gen that is like 100 cheaper at best then new cards",
      "its simple. Ask 400 for the 7700XT. The issue is quite simple to solve but that would mean that the company caved in.",
      "AMD can never decide if they want to make their cards equal to Nvidia or ahead. The R9 290x and HD 7970 also had awkward naming in relation to the competition.",
      "AMD will probably price the 7800XT at 749 and act surprised when Nvidia takes 80 to 90 percent market share again.\n\n7800 XT should be 599.",
      "I am aware that AMD have models with the XTX moniker before. It wasn't the best choice of words to say that, but that is beside the entire point I was making. I think it's pretty clear that I'm referring to the fact that the 6000 series did not have a halo \"XTX\" model.\n\nThanks.",

Not that I'm turning a blind eye, just that it doesn't affect me, and my post was my opinion and thoughts based on what I know and am familiar with.",
      "AMD is not innovating and is just happy to ride NVIDIA's coattails  while only getting money largely from their fanboys",
      "AMD is going to have to be VERY competitive with their pricing if they want to move these cards at all especially with the lack of frame generation. Most people without this feature will quickly discredit it and write it off but with my hands on experience it's a game changer.",
      "What were you expecting them to be?\n\nI think performance estimates are too high, though. The 7900xt had 25% more bandwidth, and 20% more boost clock compute even after the clock bumps. We're probably talking 6900xt performance on average, with better RT and machine learning. Still behind the 4070ti in every way except VRAM.\n\nI guess people were expecting another  navi31 cut, maybe? 72 CU or something?",
      "Yeah, you're right. I know they haven't always been that way (RX 480 ≈ GTX 1060, as a recent example). I think my point was more that the past two generations *did* align with Nvidia's name scheme for the most part, and this generation doesn't. It's not so much a problem if the naming is consistently inconsistent, but suddenly no longer matching can lead to some bad expectations.\n\nI think the name of the 7900 XTX alone was a significant factor in making people believe AMD was going to match/beat the 4090.",
      "I think all these specs would have been great had AMD achieved the performance targets. Remember NVIDIA actually decreased CU's for cards compared to previous generation. But the performance uplift was so good that the cards still delivered better performance compared to cards with more CU's across the lineup.\n\nAMD didn't have much IPC gains or clock speeds and hence the 7000 series look lackluster in comparison.",
      "> The 7600XT is literally just a rebadge, plain and simple. Nothing to see here. :(\n\nIf it's based on the N33, then it clearly isn't a rebadge, but it won't be more than 20% faster (on avg) than N23 either, and even that isn't a given. RT should see more of a gain, but not sure how viable that is outside of perhaps RT shadows.",
      "Tbh I'm expecting prices to be a lot better than many doom and gloomers. 7900 XT is starting a hundred less than the 6900 XT and not selling. AMD tends to be quick to adjust prices to market, so I think it'll drop to 800, although probably not formally (AMD seems to favor reimbursing retailers behind the scenes to cut prices rather than formally adjusting MSRP).\n\nThe 7800 XT has 5/7 the CU count and value increases as you go down the stack. 5/7 * 800 = 571. So the 7800 XT is probably gonna be 550-630.\n\n6700 XT and below MSRP's were set during the shortages, 25% tariff, and cryptofuck epidemic. So they were higher than otherwise.\n\nThe 7700 XT is going to be getting 20% more CU's than the 6700 XT, so it will have 80% of the 7800 XT. Again, value tends to increase down the stack until you hit the 6 series. So .80 * 571 = 456.80. So probably 400-450 and it'll perform a bit over halfway between the 6800 and 6800 XT, probably closer to the 6800 XT.\n\n7600 XT is probably gonna be around 6700 XT performance. 7700 XT has 50% more CU's than it, 456.80 * 0.66 = 304). The 6 series is where value tends to drop off, so I think it'll be 300-340.\n\nThe 7600 is 28 CU's, or 7/8 the 6600/7600 XT. So it should be no trouble to match a 6600 XT and will probably come close to the 6650 XT. As for the price, 320 * 7/8 = 280.\n\nA lot of this will depend on what Nvidia is doing, but assuming Intel continues unfucking the drivers and reliably delivers 6700/XT level performance at 250 with the A750, competition is fierce.",

The only one that seems promising so far is from XFX: Gamer's Nexus had a 7700 XT from XFX in the video, and it looks like it may be a true 2-slot design. Still waiting for the official specs though.\n\nGiven that 7800 XT and 7700 XT are close in TBP, XFX could save money by using the same cooler.

TLDR: They just want AMD or Intel to put pressure on NVgreedia to lower their prices.",

Most Nvidia hardware cannot compete against either card in the under 500 dollar range unless the RTX 4060ti 16 GB card can be found in that budget which rarely (never) ever happens.",

Not even PCIe - it was an AGP card.\n\nThen I realised that I made a mistake immediately after installing it on my Pentium 4 HT 3.2 system, with incredible 256MB of RAM and a 120GB HDD.\n\nNot worth it. It's price deprecation is ridiculous. I paid a lot for it and a year later, it was worth less than half of what I paid. Not to mention that I was already an adult, I had a job, I had bills to pay. I had no time to play games and hardly ever used it.\n\nThat GPU lasted till 2011 with me when I finally upgraded my system to a x64 architecture. Then this 2011 system lasted till 2018.

      "Eh I reckon it will do fine at 1440p if you buy the 16GB version and you're willing to use DLSS and turn down the RT settings a bit.\n\nIt sure isn't like a 60Ti from the glory days (3060Ti and 1060), but it will probably be a decent card. It shouldn't be nearly as bandwidth starved as the 4060Ti 16GB either due to GDDR7 offering a boatload of extra bandwidth on the same bus width. It should have similar bandwidth to the 4070 Ti.",

The 9070(and XT) are looking like they might be really solid options with AMD bringing a true DLSS alternative and actual RT hardware on them.\n\nThe 9070 is looking like it might be roughly like a 4070 Super with 16GB of VRAM with decent RT performance, unlike the 7700XT.",

With the mess of the 7600 and 4060 Ti launches it has me wondering. Could we see a 12 or 16GB 7700XT and 16GB 7800XT launch sometime around July to rain on Nvidia's parade? Or will we see AMD holding out indefinitely? Especially if they still have a massive overstock of 6000 series cards gathering dust.\n\nWe are already seeing price cuts but are AMD and their partners (as well as retailers who paid in advance for stock) unwilling to make those cuts? Particularly if they are making significant losses on each card?\n\nAt any rate if they do launch them I do believe they need to come in at around 400 and 500 dollars respectively.\n\nI'm not seeing any rumors or leaks on these cards so I am just throwing this out there for discussion.",
    "comments": [
      "They'll probably be released after the stock of 6900/50 XTs and 6800 series sell out so that there's a more well-defined market niche that those cards would fill. I wonder if they'll release Radeon 7700, 7800, or even 7900 cards or if they're worried they'll create intra-brand confusion with the AM5 CPUs\n\nEDIT: That said, I realize they're about to reach the 7600 non-XT so maybe that's not a concern of theirs.",
      "I don't think with the current line-up that we will see 7700XT and 7800XT.\n\nMore probable will be a 16gb 7700 with performance between 6800 and 6800XT, and a 7800 with 16gb with a performance within 5-10% of the 7900XT.",
      "I don't know for sure but considering everything released so far I wasn't confident enough to wait for a 7700/7800xt. Also the 7800xt was released, AMD just called it a 7900xt and tried selling it 250$ over what the MSRP should have been.\n\nThis gen was a huge skip for me so I bought a used Nitro+ 6900xt for 400$ and don't regret it.",
      "I could see a 7800XT with performance right around the 6950XT, so \\~15% less than the 7900XT.\n\nI don't think a non-XT part would be placed that close to a next tier XT part, 6900XT is \\~30% faster than 6800, 6800XT is \\~40-50% faster than a 6700XT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso they need something against the 4060Ti, which is \\~30% faster than the 7600. With a 7700 between a 6800 and 6800XT, that would be \\~50% faster than a 7600, I could see that also as an 7700XT and then a 7700 10% below that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 7900XT is \\~2.3-2.5x as fast as the 7600, there is room for many GPUs in between there.\n\nSo my lineup would be\n\n7600 - full N33 (32 CU) - 165W - 100%\n\n7700 - heavy cut N32 (40 CU) - 185W - 120%\n\n7700XT - cut N32 (56 CU) - 230W - 160%\n\n7800XT - full N32 (64 CU) - 265W - 190%\n\n7900XT - cut 31 (84 CU) - 315W - 240%\n\n7900XTX - full N31 (96 CU) - 355W - 270%",
      "There would be little to no performance gain over 6700XT/6800XT. RDNA3 was a failure tbh, pretty clear the rumors of the hardware bugs limiting the clocks was true. I think initially AMD was hoping to have all of these clocked over 3GHz out of the box and it just wasn't happening.",
      "Yeah the naming scheme is a mess",
      ">I think the 4090 is actually the best sold model despite the price tag.\n\nThat's because it's the most powerful graphics card that money can buy. If you're building a gaming PC with unlimited money, that's the card you want.\n\nFor people who aren't rich, the 4000 series cards are all overpriced.",
      "This was my thoughts exactly. There just doesn't seem like there will be a place for anything from the Navi3X lineup",
      "Radeon Pro W7800 is already announced with 70 CUs so I expect that's what the 7800XT will also have. (W7900 is an exact match for 7900XTX aside from double VRAM and reduced clocks/TDP)",
      "Makes no difference if they come or not. All that matters now is pricing. Anything north of 700 and it's already DOA. The second hand market is still going strong for a reason.\n\nPeople just aren't spending that much on a GPU anymore.",
      "It doesn't seem like they're worried about more releases or cooking up anything interesting. They're comfortable occupying this silly GPU lane of \"half the headlining features of an Nvida card for a 20% discount\" so what do they have to worry about. Innovating? Seriously competing? They just aren't that into the market. They want to be the cheapo knockoff that has never felt more like the cheapo knockoff.\n\nI really wish Intel would start fighting it out with a heavyweight card. Yeah it's against the odds, but if you ask me if I think there's any hope in hell AMD picks up the pace in desktop GPUs... no, I don't see it happening.",
      "If they release them now they must price RDNA2 super low, which in turn makes the old cards very good value and few will buy the new ones.\n\nThey just made too many last gen cards. This is also why the RTX4000 series is selling extremely poorly, I think the 4090 is actually the best sold model despite the price tag.",
      "Uh no.\n\nOne could argue that the 7900XT is the 7800XT but that would be quite an impressive improvement, 25% more VRAM and like 30% faster than a 6800XT and very capable of 4K gaming which the 6800XT wasn't due to low memory bandwidth.\n\nThe 7900XT is more like.. Between a 800 and 900 class card. And it has a very impressive memory bus alongside the infinity cache. I can kinda understand why they went with this naming scheme as the 7900XT is too fast for an 800 class card. Both are 900 class cards by specs.\n\nA 16GB 256-bit 7800XT is basically guaranteed and it will likely trade blows with the 6950XT in Raster and slightly faster in RT. Possibly better 4K performance depending on memory clocks.\n\nI wish the 7800XT would come with 20GB VRAM and the 7700XT with 16GB but it's likely going to be 16GB and 12GB this generation.\n\nExpect RDNA4 to be a bigger leap than RDNA3 was. Meanwhile for Nvidia the opposite is expected, Blackwell likely won't be that much faster than Ada, they have kinda hit the limit of a monolithic die with the 4090. But with Blackwell I expect a significant VRAM boost, with 24GB on the RTX5080 gaming flagship and 32GB on the 5090.",

      "N32 should definitely not be too slow for 7700 XT, as it should at least beat the RX 6800 non-XT, though.",
      "It isn't, I don't get why people keep pushing this narrative. In terms of cost per frame it's like the second worst card in the lineup, it beats the 4080 but not by a huge margin. \n\nThe 4090 only looks good because it's the only card that had a big performance and cost per frame uplift compared to its predecessor, the problem is that the 3090 made zero sense compared to the 3080 at their respective MSRPs."

I'd actually rather a larger, quieter card than a small one that runs hot.  It'll take waiting for the reviews to know how loud it is though.\n\nThe price is higher than I've ever paid for a card but compared to the market it is fair for the performance.  It's AMD so it'll have the Linux support I need.  This one really seems to check all the boxes for me.",

The difference is that an overbuilt cooler can run its fans slower and quieter. \n\nIt will also have more headroom for overclocking before thermal throttling - yes, putting more heat in your case - if that’s your sort of thing.",

      "Yes, when you’re testing CPUs, you want to eliminate the GPU as the bottleneck to see how the CPUs compare.  Even with the 4090, there are games where the 7700 can’t maintain 60 fps at 1080p because the game is horribly threaded (Hogwarts with RT).  Jedi: Survivor with RT would be another title where you will see big differences and sub 60 fps performance.  HUB only tested without RT, but the real cpu hit comes when you enable RT.\n\nThe idea with these tests is to show relative rather than absolute performance as future games tend to be more demanding - and there are always outliers. \n\nIn general, if you know you’re only targeting a specific fps, you can look at reviews like this and determine if the CPU generally provides that performance in games you care about.  Remember that the performance today is likely to be better than what you’ll see in 2-3 years let’s alone 5+.",

At least now it's actually testing at Ultra 1440 and 4k, rather than; 4090, 7800x3d, 720p/1080p low which literally no one will ever use outside of CSGO or Valorant. But then most CPU reviews don't even test CSGO or Valorant so...",
      "As always, it depends on the games you play. I’m in a Discord channel for both TLOU and Jedi: Survivor, including a DLSS frame generation mod for each game. Several users with a 5800x3D cannot run Jedi: Survivor on a 4090 at a locked 60 fps (120 with FG) with RT because the CPU can’t handle it.  RT is integral to the lighting in that game - in fact it cannot be disabled on the consoles (or at least it couldn’t at release).\n\nTLOU scales much better up to 16 threads, but it really likes fast memory, and a user with a 5800x3D reported micro stutter which I could not reproduce at much higher fps on a 7800x3D with fast DDR5 memory. Locking the game to 60 or 120 with FG eliminates the microstutter, as it appears to be a memory bottleneck. \n\nHogwarts: Legacy is sub 60 fps on the 7700 with RT.  The 7800x3D is a massive 47% faster at 1080p - and you’ll see it at higher resolutions because you’ll still be CPU limited. \n\nNote that these tests don’t account for DLSS.  Cyberpunk shows major gains with RT on the 7800x3D which disappear at 1440p given the GPU demands of RT.  However, at DLSS quality at 1440p, you’ll be cpu limited again.  On a 4090 and 7800x3D, I see cpu limits at 3440x1440 DLSS quality at around 120 fps.\n\nThis testing does not account for frame generation - which really does miracles for CPU-limited games.  In such scenarios, you see true doubling in FPS and much smoother frametimes as you’re eliminating the CPU bottleneck. A locked 120 FPS with FG in Jedi Survivor at Epic settings with RT looks and feels great - and even on a 7800x3D or 13900KS, there are areas where you are limited to 70 fps without FG (Koboh town).",
      "As the other person said, they use these setups to make gaming artificially CPU bound in the assumption that the performance in CPU bound gaming situations would scale/compare the same way. They do what they do for a reason (and it's not FOMO), but it's also true that a lot of actual gaming setups don't benefit that much from high end CPUs (outside probably of the ones where they're being mated to equally high end or even higher GPUs)....",
      "The only real difference you'd notice would be going from the 5800x3d to the 7800x3d and that would still be barely noticeable in 1440 or 4k which us where most if not all gamers using a 4070 or higher are gaming.",

There are cheaper intel boards only because they have some barebones boards, which AMD doesn't (not yet at least), and those don't interest me.

Once it goes down in price it would be a great option, like the 7900XT or the 6700XT before it, which also got roasted in reviews based on MSRP.",
      "Best ad for the 6800 I've seen. You save some money while winning some vram and getting the same/better performance. Somehow it doesn't even use more power than the 7700xt",
      "RX 6800 are rare though and is about to be discontinued, even if it is more appealing product due to extra vram buffer, AMD knows this exactly hence they will discontinue it soon.",
      "It’s almost like they don’t want you to buy this specific GPU",
      "The pricing obviously makes sense if you are AMD. You either buy the overpriced 7700 XT or you pay extra and buy the more expensive 7800 XT. It's a win-win either way for AMD. And let's not pretend there aren't people who would buy these on launch day at the absurd MSRPs, so those sales are still coming in. Then once the initial demand drops, the price is dropped, which lets in a new wave of sales. No one even cares about day 1 reviews at this point in the age of YouTube and influencers. It's only the reviewers who still think their day 1 negative reviews have any real-world impact on sales and how large corporations operate.",
      "Pretty much.\n\nN32's price floor is 450 because any lower would put downward pressure on N22, which in turn puts pressure on N33. They also have *some* 6800's left, but not many since yields are good, and they don't need 3 N21 SKU's within a small range. The 4060 TI is trash, and Intel doesn't have a card up here, so it's basically AMD competing with itself.\n\nN32's price ceiling is 500 because any higher and the 4070 starts making more sense.\n\nHowever, despite such a small price range, yields aren't 100% perfect; they need two SKU's.\n\nThey're prioritizing 7800 XT's since that card has higher margins (both cards cost nearly the same to make). Thus, the only 7700 XT's are defective 7800 XT's, and yields are excellent, so there aren't many.\n\nThe market for a GPU also decreases exponentially as you go up in price. So if the 7700 XT was 400 dollars (price where it'd make sense on-paper), it would sell out considerably faster than the 7800 XT while still putting *some* downward pressure on the rest of the stack. Thus, its price can be made higher than that equillibrium point.\n\nNow, making a lineup of products is like protecting a goal: you need coverage. AMD has N22 for the 300-400 dollar market, and the 4060 TI 8GB hasn't really dropped enough in price to merit a large response (it's specs are also hilariously imbalanced). If the 4060 TI's drops to 330 and 380, respectively, and N22 is gone, AMD will need a response. When that happens, they'll likely balance N32 production between the SKU's more, which lets a price gap open up between them (maybe 400 for 7700 XT, 480 for 7800 XT)\n\nWe may see a late cycle 7700 with 48CU's, made from the collected dies too defective to be 7700 XT's (kind of like the 5600x3D). That and discounts will also counter Nvidia if they drop the 4060 16GB drop to 350 (if we get to that point, they're just gonna ol yeller the 8GB model lol). It'll also counter Intel, although jury's out on how good Battlemage will be.\n\nI understand that reviews are more based on objective value, but with context, it makes sense why the 7700 XT is 450. That being said, the 7900 XT and 7900 XTX had a proportionately identical price gap to these two cards, but they made a lot more of the cheaper one. My theory there is that it was up in the air on if the renamed 4080 12GB would get a price cut and they had too much N21 left.",
      "Yeah the 7700xt is almost certainly the price it is to sell off RDNA 2 stock.",

      "Prices will go down, but by then the $100 Starfield Premium promo will be long gone.  \n\n\nPossibly this promo will be replaced by something else, who knows (AMD is not always consistency with these promos), but whichever game it happens to be, it won't be as hyped as Starfield. Besides, it is unlikely to be a $100 Premium Edition - basic $60 editions of games is what we tend to get as bundles.  \n\n\nAnyway, I am just pointing this out. If someone is waiting for the 7700XT to go down by $50, but then they plan to buy Starfield, might as well pay $450 for the 7700XT (or get the 7800XT if they can find one).",
      ">You either buy the overpriced 7700 XT or you pay extra and buy the more expensive 7800 XT. It's a win-win either way for AMD.\n\nOr you decide to save some money and go for the 6800XT because it's such good value, and help AMD clear old stock they want gone. It's a win-win-win for AMD.",

Its very competitive vs Nvidia even at $450 so isn't completely DOA.  \nC.

I have my eyes on the RX 7700 XT, I have a 1440p monitor, so I want to be able to play 1440p decently, not necessarily the latest titles or the highest settings... here in my (west European) country it goes for 450€ the lower you can find it, I don't know if I should wait or is a good moment now before the tariffs potentially drive prices higher... ¿what do you suggest me to do?\n\nThanks y'all",

    "selftext": "Hey all.\n\nI'm planning to upgrade from my current laptop (i5-2430M, Radeon HD 6470M, 8gb DDR3-1333) to something faster. Way faster.\n\nI'm torn between these two cards (RX 7700 XT and RX 6750 XT). I have heard something about the RX 7000 series being better for productivity than the RX 6000 series, I don't know if this is true.\n\nThe price difference between these two cards is 63 euro.\n\nI'm planning to use it for Unreal Engine, Unity, Godot and Blender. I don't know much about these programs since I have never used them before.\n\nDoes anyone know how much more the RX 7700 XT is better than the RX 6750 XT for game development and 3d work?",
    "comments": [
      "Between those two I'd say the 7700 XT is the better choice, but you can't go wrong with either. AMD cards will do fine in all of those but Nvidia is just superior in blender thanks to CUDA.  I've done unity dev work on a 6800 XT and it was perfectly fine. \n\nIn all honesty, except for blender your CPU matters more than your GPU with these tasks- Unity will use all the threads you can throw at it when compiling and if choosing the 6750 XT over the 7700XT gives you the budget to go for an 8-core chip instead of a 6-core chip, do it.\n\nThat being said i agree with the other commenter, a used RTX 3080 10GB is the best value in that price range right now. Those that work are well within the valley of the bathtub curve and you'll probably get at least 5 years out of a used one. (Just maybe avoid the zotac trinity model of the 3080 those are cheaper for a reason)",
      "Excuse my ignorance but aren’t nvidia cards better at these tasks?",
      "used 3080",
      "I think you will be better with Nvidea hardware as they might be better at handling productivity...",
      "All this info is very helpful, thank you!\n\nBoth options feature a Ryzen 7 7700.",
      "Probably, yes. Sadly, the best nVIDIA card that fits in my budget (430 euro) is the RTX 3060 12gb.\n\nIsn't the RX 7700 XT better than the RX 7700 XT for all my use cases (except Blender ofcourse)?",
      "They are said to be, yes.",
      "I don't really know about buying used. It's quite risky.",
      "Might be, yes.\n\nAlthough the best nVIDIA card that fits in my budget (430 euro) is the RTX 3060 12gb, what costs 290 euro here.",
      "Well productivity wise nvidia seems like your best bet. Although I don’t do any of these tasks and only game, so I went with AMD. But for productivity go for nvidia. Where are you from? 430 for a 3060 seems a bit steep imo.",
      "Less than you'd think. the biggest risk is the lack of warranty",
      "Bro Actually sometimes 7900xtx performs similar to 4060ti in Productivity so it will be better to research if AMD support those applications. It's all on your applications.",
      "I'm from the Netherlands btw.\n\nI mean't my max. Budget for a gpu is 430. The 3060 12gb costs 289 at a minimum here.",
      "I'm afraid when the buyer protection of the platform is over, That then for some (random reason) the gpu dies, and I've then lost a lot of money.",
      "Yeah, I'm researching. But it's quite difficult to find a benchmark or anything for Unreal, Unity and Godot.\n\nAtleast I found out that the RX 7700 XT is quite close to the RTX 3060 on blender.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\tMedian score:2147.17\tNumber of benchmarks:411 AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT\tMedian score:2128.77\tNumber of benchmarks:59\n\nSource: [opendata.blender.org](https://opendata.blender.org/)",
      "Thats an idea. Yes, you may need the VRAM. You may want more modern features though. Just a thought.",
      "That doesn't really happen with GPUs a ton UNLESS they've been reflowed. If they've lasted 2 years, they'll probably last another 5 if cared for properly.",
      "I have had a used 3080 for 2 years with no issues. I always buy used cards. No risk and way more performance per dollar.",
      "If possible try the things physically at a Centre near you. Whichever satisfies you buy it... I think this suggestion is sounds good but I don't know if the seller can let you check these things.... Gamers love AMD but Nvidea shifted focus to AI...."

      "My guess is retailers don't get sent the codes until AMD amends the terms, and for some asinine reason that doesn't happen until the cards are always on shelves.\n\nHonestly, the way GPU launches are done is such a confusing clusterfuck that it's ridiculous. There's been several times of furiously googling and F5'ing trying to find the listing.\n\nMy favorite was the 4060 TI, which didn't even have a listing on Amazon or Newegg US until THE NEXT DAY lmao. Like stop gaslighting me, I can read a calendar!\n\nThe fact that we need journalists to make \"Where to Buy X\" articles every launch is so fucking ridiculous. Why would these companies make it *harder* for people to give them money????? Imagine if Target or Walmart moved the electronics department to a random location in the store before Black Friday, or if a vending machine put the card reader in a different spot every single time. Wouldn't that be moronic?\n\nImo, all product listings should be up at 9am Eastern, 24 hours before release when the review embargo typically lifts, but marked as \"In stock tomorrow.\" That gives them time to fix nonsense like this.\n\nOh, and AMD.com or Nvidia.com should have links to the ACTUAL listings and/or the AIB's product page for the card. The current approach is basically \"Let me Google That For You,\" as it just links to a search of the retailers' site for the product name lmao. I know what bestbuy.com is, and I know how to type, so doing that for me is just pretentious.\n\nI shouldn't need to rely on third parties and furious googling of various articles to figure out which AIB cards are coming out, it should just be on one fucking page with the dimensions, clocks, and links.\n\n/rant"

    "comments": [
      "Good, it's a terrible connector and the blame keeps getting passed between manufacturer to user. Honestly in my opinion a connector that's too hard to plug in properly to avoid a fire is still a defect but Nvidia gets away with it because they keep calling it user error.",
      "it's shittily engineered, so thin wires in such a small space can't handle that amount of wattage, period, they were ignoring physics when \"designing\" that thing, it's why I never bought a nvidia 4000 series and just waiting out 5000...my 3080 still kicking lol",
      ">a connector that's too hard to plug in properly to avoid a fire is still a defect\n\nPersonally I blame the engineers for thinking that its a good idea to over tighten the end points of the connections.",
      "I hope they will never use it. It is electrically unsound design for amount of current it promises.",
      "good choice. better safe than sorry.",
      "Nonsense, its not the \"thin wires\" its the fact the sense pins should have been further recessed to stop the short and ideally a slightly better clamp lug.  \n\n\nIts a bit more susceptible to user error which is a failing in design but its no where near the level you make out and some minor adjustments can make it a \"solid\" design.",
      "LOL AMD used common sense where Nvidia saw none.",
      "> Is there anything wrong with the connector? Nope.\n\nA connector where Psu companies have to paint in order to let the user know that it is entirely in is not a suitable connector.\n\nStop smoking, because your brain is a fried as many 12vh connectors.",
      "They’ve updated the plug so it won’t pull power if it’s not seated correctly.",
      "Nah, we have seen folks test the connector pulling well over 1kw without issue. This is just a narrative redditors made up. \n\nThe root issue causing burnt connectors was addressed in a revision that reduces the chance of the cable pulling current when not fully inserted.",
      "Nvidia designed the original 12-pin connector that first appeared on RTX 30 series Founders Editions that would eventually evolve into 12VHPWR. Intel took Nvidia's 12-pin design and added the four sense pins to the connector for communication between the graphics card and the power supply for how much power needs to be supplied. Nvidia and Intel were the ones who actually designed the power connector. AMD's only role in the creation of 12VHPWR was that they are a member of PCI-SIG which nearly every technology company is, including Apple, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, HP, IBM. PCI-SIG has hundreds of members.",
      "consortium was planning to release it, while nvidia rushed and made their own version before the standard officially was out.",
      "I think it should've been designed with a 90-degree mounting option (or maybe that's 180-degrees, lol!), to lay on the back of GPU backplate, due to the strict wire bending guidelines the connector has. The connector housing could be designed in a way to fully capture the terminals so that they don't move and cause localized hotspotting and excess receptical-terminal strain.\n\nConnector should not be difficult to fully insert either.\n\nAll of these things should have been considered before allowing high current on effectively the same amount of 12V/GND wire pairs as 2x8-pins (6x 12V/GND pairs).",
      "the v2 of it seems good.",
      "Wasn't that just for the 3090 Ti? I thought all Ada GPUs didn't use the same connector and do use the one from the actual spec?",
      "I like the idea of 12VHPWR where a GPU can be powered with one cable and the sense pins allow the GPU to be aware of what power consumption can be handled by the power supply. The problem is that Nvidia for some bizarre reason tried to make the connector as small as a standard single 8-pin PCIe power connector. Trying to push 600W through such a tiny space leaves such little room for user error. The connector could have easily been slightly larger and chunkier, similar to 8-pins, with a definitive click when it is fully inserted and there would not have been as many problems with it as there have been.",
      "Yeah it's a sound idea to have a new connector, but when I had my 4070 I hated that connector with a passion. It felt like I had to break the damn card to unplug it and it never felt like it was \"in\" like you get with a normal 8 pin. Terrible experience.",
      "if nothing is wrong, why did it get a redesign and manufacturers try to make it better themselves?",
      "More people need to realize how cheap the power supply manufactures got with this. PCIe 8 pins carry a max of 150w so each one of them is designed to be physically capable of carrying 300w to ensure that they'll always be able to hit that 150w spec regardless of manufacturer tolerances. Maybe that's overengineered, but HPWR is designed to carry 600w so the cable is specced to carry... exactly 600w. \n\nAny hardware engineer worth a damn could have predicted that'd be a complete disaster that'd result in actual fires, and what do you know!",
      "Honestly what they should have done is built the connector as a split style design, much like the 20+4 atx or 4+4 12v cpu..\n\nNewer lower tier cards could use half of it with more than sufficient power delivery and the high tier cards use the full connector. And imo, concentrate it into more of a sqaurish block rather tna a long thin connector. Specially for including the sensing pins. Honestly the design of it looks like it was clearly engineered to meet napkin level math and application and takes ZERO consideration into real world use scenarios. The rule of thumb should always be, whatever the requirements are even after adding for some variables, double the reliability and strength capacity."

Navi 23 was released 5 month after Navi 22, 9 months after Navi 21.\n\nOn the other hand the 6600M XT (mobile Navi 23) was announced on the 31st of May 2021, so about 6 months after Navi 21 was released, while the 7600M XT (mobile Navi 33) was announced at CES this year, less than a month after Navi 31 was released, although this doesn't mean much for shipping.\n\nAnyway, that's the info.

Because it's a smaller chip than Navi 21 (so probably better yields), AMD might not see a need to release a further cut down variant.\n\nSo I'm guessing that Navi 32 will be used for the 7800 XT.

I think it's reasonable for AMD to release a 60 CU Navi 22 and a 48 CU one with a 192 bit RAM bus, and then the difference between 32 CU Navi 33 and the 48 CU SKU would be 50%, which won't be higher than the Navi 22 to 21 gap.\n\n> or else the performance improvement will look pitiful.\n\nYou mean like the 6500 XT over the 5500 XT?

Bugs are to be expected with Intel GPUs, growing pains are to be expected. you know that (or should know that) when you buy in.\n\n>and Nvidia cards are being underutilized\n\nIt stands to reason that AMD, who sponsored the title, would work with Bethesda to ensure the game has no speed bumps interacting with its hardware. All games hit different speed bumps with different hardware. That's what driver updates and game patches are for. In this case, AMD and Bethesda have simply \"pre-\"updated drivers and \"pre-\"patched the game to remove their specific speed bumps.\n\nThey didn't (or likely didn't, anyway) *create* any speed bumps for Nvidia hardware. AMD simply haven't helped Bethesda smooth the existing ones over. And Bethesda, because of the sponsorship, have simply bumped AMD speed bumps up to the top of the queue for fixing.\n\nSo it's not that Nvidia cards are being underutilized, but that 1) Bethesda may have deprioritized any Nvidia-specific fixes, and 2) Nvidia haven't had the chance to do its respective optimization passes. (And, according to MLID, the team within Nvidia responsible for driver development haven't received the budget to do so.)\n\n> let alone have XeSS, .... on top of not having DLSS.\n\nThe decision to implement a software feature - any software feature - is ultimately up to the developer (barring, of course, the possibility of contract stipulations).\n\nAdding XeSS and/or DLSS on the developer's side adds more work, even if the integration itself is relatively simple. QA, testing, etc. If there's one solution that works on all hardware, from a dev's standpoint, why wouldn't you want to use that? Simplifies the entire dev process.\n\nI'd even argue that it being so easy to mod in DLSS support is only MORE reason to just include FSR. You cover every single hardware solution in one go with an upscaling solution, you minimize the work you have to do, and the people who want DLSS can still use DLSS.\n\n>Meanwhile... the 7900XT 20GB beats the 4080,\n\n...which it has done on multiple occasions, just as the 4070 Ti has beaten the 7900 XTX on occasion. Heck, the 7900 XT can beat the 40***90*** in Call of Duty. Are you going to argue that AMD paid Infinity Ward to cripple Nvidia cards in CoD? Well, you might, but of course you'd be wrong."

      "It really comes down to the target resolution you play in as well as the types of games you play. If you're primarily playing esports games and want as many fps as possible, the 7700XT is probably the better choice. \n\nIf you're looking to play the latest and greatest, graphically intensive games it's impossible to match the value DLSS adds in regards to performance for such a slight quality loss and how prevelant it is. You can also use ray tracing on the 4060ti, which can make some series differences visually. Sure, FSR is available, but the visual quality isn't really close to DLSS, that may change with FSR 4, assuming it comes to the 7xxx GPUs and that's setting aside it's potential adoption rate. \n\nCurrently FSR 3 is the best offering AMD has, and while it's been available for a while now, it's not uncommon for games to still ship with FSR 2.xx still while DLSS is generally available in the majority of new or major releases. \n\nFrame generation comes with both benefits and negatives, while I have a 40xx series GPU I tend to opt not to use it regardless. Before that, I used to mod FSR frame generation into games to use with my 3070ti, mostly to see what the hype was about",

After 1 year, the monitor starting randomly powering off, and then it started taking longer and longer to power on (probably bad caps).  \n3. RMA'd it to Acer (it had a 2 year warranty). 1 month later I got the monitor back and it worked for 6 months before it failed exactly the same way again. So I RMA'd it again.  \n4. Another month later, a brand new 1920x1080 23.5\" TN panel that was selling for $350 shows up with terrible viewing angles, awful color reproduction, and response times no better than the P-MVA panel I sent in. Contacted Acer and told them it was not what I paid for, what they sent me is unusable junk, and I either want the panel I bought repaired and returned to me, or I want a full refund. They responded that they had no replacements available, they were sorry, and that their customer service would be contacting me to work something out.\n\nI never heard from them, they stopped responding to my e-mails, and I got hung up on several times when I tried (politely, mind) talking to them on the phone. That was the first and last time I ever bought an Acer product.\n\nI've since dealt with Acer a few more times for clients, but those are different stories (and it only went marginally better).",

      "I would have preferred if they used Cyberpunk RT for testing OC. 3DMark benchmarks are very skewed for RDNA3 GPU OCs and don't tell the full story (e.g. my 7900xtx can run them at 1020mv but games typically need 1100mv).",
      "It costs $50 more than the $400 you are asking, and it comes with a free $100 game.",

      "I think because I had to sit out the 6000/RTX30 series and scalpers, I have no issue with the current market. My 4080 cost me less than the 2080 ti it replaced, offers huge improvements and I didn't have to fight scalpers.\n\nBut everyone is different. AMD is definitely going to try to maximize profits, and they should, but consumers should do everything in their best interest.",
      "Not that I've seen. I bought it though and judging from the 7700XT Pulse review, I'd expect identical performance to the stock version of 7800XT but better temps and noise. I can post what I've got once the card arrives.",
      "I assume there's not enough defective dies to have enough supply for a 400 dollar 7700 XT, yet.",
      "As I mentioned it wouldn't. In case you didn't see what TPU said, you need to undervolt to get higher clock speeds for RDNA3. This also means Timespy can get insane gains from a unrealistic undervolt, because it somehow still runs at ultra low voltage, yet for gaming you're only stable at around 1080\\~1100 mv at best. Vex did a test with 15% PL, and it was only like a 5% fps increase. I'd bet there's another 4\\~5% from gain undervolting which he failed to realize since he didn't understand the architecture. It's probably only 10% better at best which is still insane imo as an OC.",
      "Same results with me. Temps hover around 60-62C during gameplay, my case fans are louder than the GPU so can't complain about that. Upgraded from 5700XT Red Dragon so getting generally near double fps with what little testing I've seen. No coil whine either.\n\nThis is with default settings, haven't tried undervolting yet.",
      "Now we wait for NVidia to undercut it so we can get it at $400, oh how the turntables /s",

There's also \"Anti-Lag+\" to be included with HYPR-RX, but it sounds like AMD doesn't want to talk about that yet.

AFMF will be added later though. It's still unclear to me if Anti-Lag+ will be part of HYPR RX at launch.\n\nThere's also come discussion on FSR3 requirements. Some reports are saying that only GPUs past a certain release date will be able to use, that it is available to any GPU brand and not necessarily any GPU. Supposedly that is RDNA1 or equivalent. I've seen some sites report that could mean GTX 900 or later, it depends, but for sure RTX 2000 or later and results on RDNA 2 and 3 will be better than RDNA 1."

That is not a great showing for RDNA3.\n\nI could probably find some redeeming things to say about the 7700 XT if it launched at $399.

Still awaiting AMD reply:   \n\"Hello, I just purchased new release PURE AMD Radeon™ RX 7800 XT 16GB yesterday from Newegg (which is a consumer authorized merchant partner for Sapphire as well as most of your AMD graphics cards.) According to all marketing from AMD as well as the Sapphire website: https://www.sapphiretech.com/en/consumer/pure-radeon-rx-7800-xt-16g-gddr6 , this graphics card qualifies for the Starfield Premium edition bundle. I already wrote to Newegg, and they said it does not qualify. Reading the Sapphire website disclaimer, it states \"Available through participating retailers only.\" Newegg is definitely a participating retailer, as they are showing this Starfield bundled with other 7800 XT brands (ASRock, etc...). Also, since the Sapphire website here shows the 7800 XT as a qualified graphics card, and the only place for a consumer (non commercial) to purchase this specific Sapphire 7800 XT, by default this would have to be a participating and qualified purchase. Sapphire summarily wrote back to me to contact you at AMD directly, as AMD is handling the Starfield game code distribution. I could almost understand the participating vendors disclaimer if there were multiple storefronts offering the Sapphire 7800 XT, however Newegg is the only storefront for consumer purchase. So with one default storefront, combined with the Sapphire 7800 XT as a qualified graphics card, this purchase on Newegg has to qualify, since Newegg is a participating merchant.\"",

Games now run pretty well on 4 physical + 4 logical threads. But then again, games used to run fine on one thread. Then two threads. Now 4 threads. Wait, now the i5 is getting beaten by the i7, make that 8 threads...\n\nSome of the 1080ti reviews already show Ryzen beating the 7700k because it ends up being a CPU bottleneck on total throughput. To an extent, games do generate additional operations for the CPU as resolution and settings are dialed up. Consider shadows, particle effects, physics, etc. Some of this work is done by the CPU, varying in degree by engine. These tasks are often parallelizable, so Ryzen should have a big advantage with such work. And we are already seeing it.\n\nLow settings, low resolution to check for CPU bottlenecking is horseshit, IMO, since that really only tests the main game loop and none of the auxiliary work.\n\nNow I'm REALLY laughing my ass off at the people who cancelled their Ryzen/AM4 orders and insta-switched to 7700k cookie cutter builds.",
      "i5s are turning into pentiums  as games take advantage of more cores and SMT. Hopefully now that Ryzen is a thing Intel will stop making i5s (or make i7s 6c/12t i5s 4/8 and i3s 2/4)."

But the big issue is, the 13600k is 53% faster in MT. The MT gap is simply too big to care about the marginal gaming difference, it reminds me of early Ryzen, where the 1800x was a moderately slower in gaming than the 7700k, but dominated it in MT. Consumers dont ignore such a big MT difference even if gaming is weaker, and that big MT gap is what sold early Ryzen CPUs.",
      "Lower prices first. Get on it.",
      "That's... kinda low? Shouldn't it be more like 25% based off of core count alone? I presume setting more aggressive PBO targets would probably fix it.\n\nIn any case this doesn't mean much unless AMD can clamp down the motherboard prices",
      "I look at these numbers and think that part wouldn't be worth releasing to retail. 5% worse ST, 13% better MT is probably less useful at this performance level than a base 7600X. It looks incrementally worse against 13600K even at $299.",
      "> the 13600k is 53% faster in MT. \n\nAnd the real slaughter on the MT front, will be when the locked i5s come out. The lowest 6+8 SKU (13500 I think) will essentially be the Zen 2 situation but reversed. Get 75-80% of the gaming performance but much higher MT/$ at a considerably lower price.",

That alone compensates for the price increase of lower tier DDR5, there's also the matter of the benchmarks always comparing like-for-like as opposed to people buying 13600K and running it on cheaper DDR4 for the maxdimum price advantage, where I assume performance will favour the cheaper 7700 much more. I'd honestly like to see a 'cheap' 13600 system (i.e. not 4000+Mhz RAM) compared to an AM5 system, instead of people pointing at the 13600 dominating somewhat on a DDR5 system where the total platform costs are much closer to AM5 anyway.",

ALD still holds up better against Zen 4 than Zen 3 does in gaming.\n\n>BTW AMD also have low-end productivity chips that could get 75-80% gaming perf at good price-to-MT perf ratio... it's called AM4.\n\nAnd Intel i5s will offer better/similar gaming performance and better MT at the same price point than AM4 as well.\n\nNow what?",

With the pound recovering you can expect Intel pricing to come down in a few weeks/months.\n\nThe situation you describe exists essentially nowhere else in Europe.

And that is assuming board+RAM pricing is the same, but in reality it currently favors Intel.",

      "What’s next? You’re going to tell people it’s also not about the price?",
      "> while 7600X is 13% higher than 12900K \n\nAnd perhaps you should use aggregate data, rather than the reviewer on the whole net that posts the best AMD results because of his testing setup and choice of games. Two can play this game, I could take TPU results and show you how the 7600X is [slower than a 12600K at 720p](https://tpucdn.com/review/intel-core-i9-13900k/images/relative-performance-games-1280-720.png)\n\nThe truth lies somewhere in between. HWUB is one extreme, TPU is close to the other. The 7600X stock is roughly as good as a 12900K with stock DDR5 and a bit faster if the ALD has stock DDR4. But 12900K has the benefit of gaining A LOT from memory, be it DDR4 or DDR5. \n\n>In Hardware Unboxed review (1080p gaming), 13900K has 8% higher gaming perf than 7600X, while 7600X is 13% higher than 12900K and 17% higher than 12700K with DDR4. Meanwhile, 12700K with DDR4 is just 6% faster than 5950X in gaming.\n\nHWUB DDR4 DRAM benchmarks are in general worthless. After the used G2 at 4000MHz on locked ALD chips rather than just running at 3800/3900 G1, he lost the last shred of credibility he had in that department. His results are also all over the place, with some ALD chips scaling better than others with \"the same RAM\" and game/settings, great consistency there!\n\nSteve is also benching with the questionable hand picked, provided by AMD DDR5 kit from the review package iirc. If Intel had sent specific 7000Mhz+ kits to test RPL with, what would this community have said then? You would have been screaming about bloody murder. AMD does not support 6000MHz DDR5 fyi. Either test at stock or with memory you sourced yourself at reasonable \"max settings\", anything else is just trying to shift the narrative in whichever direction.",

But among the current overpriced cards, 400 would have been a much better price, possibly even 420 depending on benchmarks(and for the meme). 450 is a clear upsell to 7800xt price point, reviewers will not be kind to it at 450.",

With the cheapest 6800 being $430, the 7700 xt's price makes a little more sense, but yeah, still slightly higher than what's ideal IMO. No doubt it's going to drop eventually, just like the 7600 is now available for $250-260 in some places.",

    "title": "7700XT vs 4070 Super?",
    "selftext": "I got a [build list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4YYmvj) ready for my PC. Now, something I realized the other day was that I needed to make it a priority to get a new monitor too, and that cuts into my budget - I'm trying to shave a few hundred off wherever I can, and I'm wondering if the RTX 4070 Super I so wanted is what has to go.\n\nFrom [this benchmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgBO2ScltgM) it looks like the 7700XT gets about 80-90% of the performance on average, for about 60% of the cost, at least for non-ray tracing. That makes it seem like the least painful way to trim my build cost - I should still be happy with the GPU for years, and I can upgrade it if needed down the line.\n\nI do have some questions though.\n\n1: I know that AMD cards are worse at ray tracing per dollar than Nvidia. However, I only plan to use ray tracing for the novelty - I'm not sold on it being vital to the gaming experience. Can I expect to run ray traced games at 1080p 30FPS on high settings? As long as I can test it out for a few hours without it being painful to look at, I'm satisfied on that front.\n\n2: I saw in a very old thread something about AMD being more prone to needing troubleshooting than Nvidia is. Is there any truth to that still in 2024?\n\n3: Is there anything else you think might be helpful for me to know?\n\nBonus question about general PC building - are there other parts in this build list that I could change out to save more to go towards the monitor and peripherals, without being much of a performance loss?\n\nBonus question 2: if I don't buy a Windows 11 activation key immediately and just use the free version for a month or so, what limitations would that impose?\n\nBonus question 3: I DO want my PC to look nice. Between [case 1](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QnD7YJ/fractal-design-pop-air-atx-mid-tower-case-fd-c-poa1a-02) and [case 2](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3nD7YJ/fractal-design-pop-air-atx-mid-tower-case-fd-c-por1a-01), which do you personally think would look better with black internals? I like the idea of RGB fans in an otherwise no-RGB build, just as an accent, but I'm not sure whether the white case on black internals would \"pop\" or if it would clash. Also, how can I verify that the parts I pick fit inside the case, alongside a [support bracket for the GPU](https://www.amazon.com/Graphics-Brace-Support-Holder-Bracket/dp/B09FPJL1KY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=22N6M82BND9DR&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Y0Ec4wY79HC-EUw6I9gqsmIn4fTWGAyDbE0TrshyDOeoFEwowCxGl4_g4XBy7HEziikoVIAbHXnN9dY4nRyQ94VQYGSHwMA_fSiLsSEnBP9_90BHLq6Xl92-D5MG8MMyQ97XsEk4yePU_2q6jaNl-8g89uFe8Rzq9X5p_TTqg8FdipCmWIoaQziYDdaQtr5VGEGRDrwwPToXjtwM-sbOZLJNqyivx8d7nkAW9ZBk6Wg.Nk4YIqzP0R40yA1jju8ZPwVgIdHp0k7fzbVp1UaYwNw&dib_tag=se&keywords=gpu%2Bsupport%2Bbracket&qid=1709404390&sprefix=gpu%2Bsuppo%2Caps%2C262&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1)?\n\nAnyway, I don't have a hard limit on what my budget is - I have about $1100 USD set aside for this right now, and I'm not willing to make the cuts to fit that budget for a PC/monitor/some other peripherals, therefore I'm gonna need to set aside a portion of my check every month for a while. All the budget determines is how many months I need to wait.\n\nThank you",

      "You'll probably get more traffic/responses over at r/buildapc but I'll offer my opinion\n\n1. The expectation regarding RT performance varies per game. I'd suggest checking out benchmarks for the 7700xt in some RT games. Alan Wake2 / Cyberpunk being two which will give you an idea on RT performance on titles that have heavy use of RT.\n\n2. I'm not sure there's any data out there to quantify whether or not AMD is more prone to troubleshooting than Nvidia. I personally have had less problem with nvidia cards than AMD. But my experience is anecdotal and not necessarily representative of the experience you will have with your hardware. My personal recommendation would be nvidia but that's because of said personal experience.\n\n> Bonus question 2: if I don't buy a Windows 11 activation key immediately and just use the free version for a month or so, what limitations would that impose?\n\nA watermark on your screen I'm pretty sure; but I've never run windows unregistered before. \n\nGenerally speaking a black case is going to look better with black internals; IMO - but aesthetics is a very personal thing.\n\n> Also, how can I verify that the parts I pick fit inside the case, alongside a support bracket for the GPU?\n\nThe biggest concern tends to be whether or not your GPU will fit. Cases will have specs on how large a GPU they can accommodate; look at them and compare them to the size of the GPU you are planning to buy.\n\nFor a support screw tower you'll need to know how much room you're working with as they come in different lengths.",

So between an extra 4gb of vram and a warranty, I chose the warranty. I heard someone else say that for mid-range cards or lower the vram is not something you're likely to be bottlenecked by at the power they can output anyway.\n\nNot trying to discount what you're saying, or your personal experiences - but I got so many conflicting pieces of advice that I can't possibly follow all of them, and I made a decision about 3 days ago.\n\nAnd yes, I realize this conflicts with what I said about needing to save for a few months before making any purchasing decisions. I got impatient and ordered everything for a price *near* my budget.",

A few cuts (like a more budget-friendly GPU), non-necessary parts put off (I can put up with my old monitor and keyboard for a few more months), and shopping around for good prices got the amount I'll pay now to $1162 ($1252 after sales tax), and what I'll pay later to around $450.

The only way it makes sense is if AMD don't call it the 7800 XT and simply call it the 7700 XT. How could they justify it performing basically the same as the previous generation's product?\n\nAs for pricing, AMD's upcoming 4070 competitor (whether called the 7700 XT or 7800 XT) will have to undercut the 4070, so I'd expect models to be $50-100 cheaper and offer one or more free games. Nvidia's rebate of the 4070 is indicative that they know the 4070 is priced beyond demand, so it'll be interesting to see where prices end up from both sides.\n\nAs for waiting, I'd say buy for your needs.

Can it really vary that much where you see like 10% gains in other games and +100% in some as well to balance the scale so the chart makes more sense?",
      "Someone broke the NDA.",

Those are the same people that will say AMD missed the opportunity to not miss an opportunity when the card releases\n\n650 isn't a good price, it's DOA, 100$ off the competition when the 5070ti eventually comes back down in price is not enough, we've seen that before and it failed, 7800xt vs 4070,  the 7800 was better than the 4070 in except RT and Upscaling tech, but people bought the 4070 anyway. The 4070S came and its actually the better buy when it's at msrp\n\n650$ gives their AIBs the chance to bump prices close to the 5070ti... And we all know no matter how many times Nvidia screws the customers, everyone still buys them anyway. This price affects the products down the stack as well, what's the 9070 going to be priced at? 20% less than the xt? That's close to a 5070, and the general consumer market would just buy the 5070 anyway because of the brand\n\nThese performance numbers, are somewhat impressive, but then if the price is still just 100$ off Nvidia, it's good as dead.",
      "While DLSS 4 is amazing, FSR 4 is supposed to be still pretty good, much better than before. If the AMD card is $100-150 cheaper or more, it’s the better value for most people (if these rumors are accurate). It’s faster natively than the 5070Ti, and only falls (slightly) short in RT, but not by a CRAZY margin it seems. With 5070Ti barely in stock and at $900+ when it is, the 9070XT at a rumored $650 would be a STEAL. Even at MSRP $750, 9070XT would be a good deal at $650, but no higher.",

Or in [RTX 5070 Ti review](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x/35.html) where the 5070 Ti is anywhere from 15.9% slower than a 7900 XTX to 32.3% faster than the 7900 XTX.\n\nAlso the variance is a little lower than you're assuming:  \n\nIn the case of GamersNexus review, the RX 7900 XTX Nitro+ is 80.4% faster (211.8/117.4) than the RTX 4070 FE in FFXIV.  \n\nIn the TPU review the RX 7900 XTX is 51.5% faster (100%/66%) than the RTX 4070.",

      "keep in mind that historically the higher CU count does not scale very well with AMD. If you compare 7800XT with 7900XTX thats 60% more CU but results only in 44% higher performance. 7900XT has 40% more CU and 28% more performance. The sweetspot always seems to be around 64 CU (Scaling from 7700XT to 7800XT is way more linear).\n\nAlso RDNA3 used Chiplets while RDNA4 is monolithic. Performance might be 5-10% shy of an XTX. It comes down to architectural changes and if the chip is not memory starved.",
      "I bet AMD did something to make these additional ALUs more useful. Something like adding more register space and extending the types of instructions the second set can perform to allow for single-cycle Wave64 execution more often.\n\nHaving less CUs also means having less scheduling overhead btw. I believe one of the reasons the command processor in flagship RDNA3 clocked higher than the shaders was because of such overhead.\n\nAnyways, the rumored 390mm² seem considerably large for a die with just 64CUs and a 256bit memory interface. Something in that chip is needing tons of space and I don't think it's the fixed-function units or shaders (although the latter are probably less dense than usual to allow for higher clock speeds).\n\nI can't wait to see the architecture reveal and test results from reviewers - I love seeing how these technical aspects affect performance.",

Almost the same number of cores, it would be depending on architectural improvements and clock speed bumps. If it hits 7900xt levels of performance with better ray tracing for 600 then idk I guess that's a win. But if you don't really care about ray tracing then you could have gotten a 7900xt for 650 back at mid year prime day. AND it has more vram.",
      "Interesting, considering the RTX 4080 was $1199 at launch. If people chose that card over 7900XT, it wasn't really about price, as even the XTX was $200 cheaper. The 4080 Super was priced similarly to 7900XTX.\n\nHowever, the price of 7900XT was certainly artificially high to push buyers into the XTX for \"only $100 more.\" I think that was AMD's primary mistake.\n\nNvidia has consistently shown that consumers will pay higher prices, but only if they're getting the very best performance and features on the market (something AMD can't claim when RT is enabled).",

      "I don't really agree. the 7800xt at 500 looked alot better than the 7700xt for 450 at launch. the price to performance was significantly worse on it and 10% more for 25% more vram and 18% more 1440p speed is very substantial. Really it should have been 400 at most it would have gotten really good reviews at like 350-380. The 7800xt and the 7900gre were the only rdna 3 cards that had a decent launch price I think.\n\n\nThe sales since then have been pretty good with the 7900xt especially but the launch prices have really hurt amd imo I think it costs them money and pisses off consumers at the same time. The current people deciding the pricing structure have zero idea what good reviews and word of mouth marketing is worth. They are picking up pennies and losing dollars with the high release price strategy. Ironically Nvidia is the one who should be doing that on the 90 tier cards but they don't. They let them get scalped for months and never drop prices even 2 years later.",

Mindfactory just sells more AMD stuff and it's one retailer in a sea of maybe hundreds of thousands of retailers and distributors across the globe.\n\nOnce you account for laptops, pre-builts, other markets such as Asia where NVIDIA dominates versus maybe Europe which is more AMD friendly, Net Cafes/PC Bangs, OEM Desktops, Small Office Machines, Servers, Professional Industry Computers, University Research Computers etc etc, NVIDIA just wins out the market because they ship more units and they've made an amazing software stack where AMD isn't competitive. \n\nIf you want to use Blender, NVIDIA's better. If you want to use DaVinci Resolve, NVIDIA's better. If you want to do AI, NVIDIA's better. If you want to use Adobe software, NVIDIA's better. If you want to stream, NVIDIA is better. If you want to game with RT, NVIDIA is better. DLSS is better than FSR. If you want to buy a laptop it's 90% going to have an NVIDIA dGPU. If you want to buy a pre-built, it's 70-80% likely to have an NVIDIA GPU.\n\nThe only area where AMD is doing well in pre-builts and the market overall maybe now is APUs (which they pretty much always have) and CPUs. Otherwise, their dGPU stuff is non-existent almost. It's so hard to find an RX 7600S laptop versus a 4060 one for example. I mean what do you expect? They're doing the bare minimum in GPU and sometimes Intel is upstaging them like with XeSS.\n\nTired of seeing these threads... \"Oh wow the 7800 XT sold 1,000 more units at Mindfactory than the 4070, surely AMD is winning!\" /s\n\nI wonder what the next thread will be \"7900 XT outsells the 4080 SUPER at Mindfactory\".

Previously I even thought that the hardware survey was done automatically to ALL units with Steam installed, guess not. \n\nSo while Steam hardware survey shows stats, it might be selective (especially sometimes when there is a sudden influx of Chinese users being surveyed lmao). I'd at least expect NVidia to at the minimum be 65% market share, probably 70%+."

The MCM area overhead is atrocious.\n\nSo basically take a 7600 and then add three Zen4 chiplets worth of area, to slide performance upwards from 4060 to 4060 Ti performance.  Which it should edge past pretty easily ofc (4060 ti + 5-10%?) but it's gonna be a godawful deal for AMD.  Like I guess if it's 10% faster than 4060 Ti 8GB they do $429?  What an absolute waste of silicon from their perspective.  \n\nThere literally is not a number where that product is worthwhile - even at $499 it would be a waste of silicon for AMD compared to Zen chiplets.  And 7800 really needed to be sold for at least $600.  But the product performance just can't justify that.  This is Vega 2.0 where AMD is getting pinched by how poorly their silicon is performing relative to the established performance levels of the competition, and even AMD can't pretend it's an awesome deal at MSRP, but neither can they afford to go any lower on pricing.\n\nThat was when we saw the bundle deals (\"buy a GPU for $100 more than MSRP and get a coupon for $100 off a specific monitor nobody wants absolutely free, coupon expires in 30 days!\") and other crap kick in to shift ASPs upwards.  And even still, standalone MSRP was so low that partners couldn't actually make a profit on the cards they were ordering from AMD (\"made by AMD\" reference cards).  Everyone got real mad about that with NVIDIA a year ago, I think everyone forgot that was an AMD thing with Vega too lmao.\n\nI think the numbers have to be $499 for 7800 and $399 for 7700, *maybe* they will try for $529/$429 to squeeze a couple more bucks but at $450/$550 they are DOA.  DLSS alone is worth 10% to me.",

Wouldn't be a hard decision for me to go for the 4080 if I was deciding between the two.\n\nAMD is delusional with their pricing this gen or maybe they just don't care and know they won't sell much at their current prices and are ok with it as long as the profit margins are high.\n\nNvidia is also delusional with their pricing this gen but at least they have a good line of cards and people justify paying more for the better features.",

So yeah the 4GB of VRAM extra is nice, but the RT performance, DLSS and other features like NVIDIA Broadcast and just general driver stability or rendering performance keep the RTX 4070 lingering around as an option. The $100 pricing gap between the 7800 XT and the 4070 in the USA is basically not really a thing here.\n\nThe 7800 XT desperately needs a price drop here in Australia to be a relevant purchase. A good $80 AUD price drop puts the 7800 XT into a spot of consideration. But then I remember that a used 6800 XT goes for around $650 AUD, so unless you really use RT or want AV1 can't see a reason to buy a 7800 XT.\n\nAnother AMD graphics card release, another dead on arrival product here in Australia.",

Same performance as last gens card something I have not seen on either nvidia or amds side in so long but hey. It's just $15 more expensive than last gens card so that's good ? Maybe...? I'm so fucking upset how did we get to this? Maybe by the time we get a 9800xt it might be a slight improvement who knows",
      ">it's $499 and runs as fast as a 4070\n\nSure, that's one way to look at it.  The other way is that it runs like a 6800XT for the price of a 6800XT.  Not saying that's bad (at least compared to the competition), just not very exciting.  People want generational uplift and this has essentially none.  If you have a mid-range or better card from last generation, there is nothing for you here.",
      "I just bought one after looking at the reviews. Also an important point is that 6800xt performance uplift via drivers is likely not going to happen anymore but 7800xt is likely going to get quite a few driver updates that improve performance. \n\nPlus I have seen reviews from 3 different sources running sometimes the same games and where Steve was getting better performance on the 6800xt the other two were getting equal or better performance on 7800xt. \n\nImportant thing to note, Steve was running the stock version of 7800xt vs sapphire nitro+ version of 6800xt. Jayztwocents was running the same version of two cards(red devil powercolor) and 7800xt was showing better results vs 6800xt. \n\nAnd I was hoping for exactly this, similar performance for less power draw and same price or cheaper. And it is in UK same price or cheaper.",
      "In theory, yes. But honestly modern cards tend to really struggle with OC's compared to older cards. The way they boost is just pretty aggressive out of the box. I think very few people get meaningful OC's on any 5000/6000/7000 series cards.",

There is a performance gap with the 4060Ti so they could charge it higher, but with the memory deficit it would be hard to justify.\n\nThe 7800XT is really in a weird place though. 499 USD could be really good. 549 would be meh.",
      "Specs on the 7700 XT look better than expected. The fact that they are positioning it against the 16GB 4060 Ti, a $500 card, doesn't bode well for the price though.",

They are comparing the 7700XT to the 4060Ti 16GB, so $449 for 7700XT is more in line with that.\n\nEDIT after the prices were announced:  \n$499 for the 7800XT seems OKish, but $449 for the 7700XT is ROFL pricing. It says in EU the prices will be 549 es 489 respectively and right now you can still get the 6800 for 459 and 489EUR which seems like a significantly better option than the 7700XT.",

The 4070 has all those extra features.\n\nFinally some generational per CU performance improvement.\nThe 60 CU 7800XT is matching 72 CU 6800XT. Not much but it's there.",

A 7700xt at 429 or something with 6800XT level of performance.\n\n7600XT at 299 with 6700xt level of performance. That way even if there is no performance improvement you reduce the prices low enough that lower tier cards can enjoy higher tier of performance for the same cost.",
      "7700 XT actually seems interesting, if it really is 12% faster than a 4060 Ti that puts it around 20% ahead of 6700 XT, not an impressive gen to gen performance gain but way better than 7800 XT's literal similar exact performance compared to it's predecessor 6800 XT which is an oof 4060 moment for AMD.\n\nNow, it just depends on the pricing, if 7700 XT is priced at over $400 then it is disappointing, same can be said with 7800XT if it is priced over $500.\n\nIdeal pricing should be:\n\n**7700 XT:  $400 or less**\n\n**7800 XT:  $500 or less**",

At the very least, 6700 XT is better value because AMD themselves made it so by reducing it up to 25% from what it was in January.",
      "At 399 it's just... worse value than the 6700xt? Same amount of vram, uses slightly more power, bit better performance, but it costs way more?",
      "It is the same though. Sure no one with a 6800XT would “upgrade” to a 7800XT, but if they price it exactly at or above what the 6800XT is available at right now, then why did those “new people” wait? \n\nThe answer is they were waiting for 6800XT performance for 6700XT price or less, because that’s the precedent for the past decade or more. Improving energy efficiency and keeping the price the same while shouting “INFLATION!” isn’t good enough to justify these cards’ existence - especially not when RAM chip prices are way down, AMD is building these on a mature previous gen node, and while they’re not breaking record profits, they’re still more than profitable and being down 18-20% from the COVID spike is misleading at best. \n\nIf the XTX had simply been the 7900 XT and everything else got bumped down a tier, this lineup would look great. A 7700XT (current 7800XT) with the performance of a 3080 12GB or 6800 XT for $450? Awesome! Positive momentum and genuine reason to justify a purchase or recommend. \n\nInstead we got the “Biff is King” timeline, but without real hoverboards.",
      "If it’s true that the 7800 XT more or less matches the 6800 XT in performance, I genuinely wonder what AMD plans to do to fill the gap between that and the 7900 XT.

It's not \"the same\", it has similar performance but greater power efficiency and new feature sets.\n\nThis isn't really for people who bought the 6800xt to \"upgrade\", its for people buying a card today to get something better overall.\n\nIt's not a far out idea, its what most companies do and have always done.",

People are suckers for paying $600 for this overpriced piece of trash, and AMD is equally as bad for pricing their cards in accordance to Nvidia's.\n\nEven adjusting for inflation, taking the $300 1060 6GB from the 2016 as reference, this card should've been $380 at launch.",
      "There is no universe where the 7800XT outsells the 4070 and AMD still makes a profit on the card. It could be $400 with the 4070 still at its original price of $600 and the 4070 would still sell several times as much. Nvidia simply has much higher brand power and better OEM connections, and even in cases where AMD has the overall better card for cheaper (see: RX 400/500 series vs GTX 1000 series) Nvidia still sells far more.",

      "DLSS quality looks absolutely fine in most games at 1080p.",

Nvidia just has a more refined software stack compared to AMD and more regular people, outside of Reddit and tech review channels/sites, recognise Geforce as the go-to brand.

      "The chiplet thing is a huge issue for them. Every time the GCD needs to go to any of the MCDs for things like LLC or memory access, it incurs a latency penalty and loses some power vs a monolithic design. It has its advantages as well, but we don't see those leveraged nearly enough to compensate.\n\nBy moving the memory controllers and such off the GCD, they free up die area for more CUs and being a chiplet design means they aren't as constrained by the reticle limit. A big GCD taking the wide-and-slow approach is more efficient than running less CUs faster, but more costly. My Radeon counterparts aren't stupid, so I expect they are learning a lot from this to tune rdna4 and as design input for 5/6.",

Also supposedly the fabrication process has an 85% yield rate, so in theory only 15% of all cards should be 7700xts, but at launch it's 50/50, so they are pushing people into buying all the 7809xt stock. They e been accumulating the chips for many months, not selling the cards yet to get rid of 6000 series stock, then they play this game to push out more 7800xt stick, then will drop the price of 7700xt in a month or two to sell those 15% yields. Assuming I understood the YouTubers correctly, who spread unverified rumors with nameless sources.",
      "Basically, the 7800 XT is a win, but only because nVIDIA didn't release the 4070 as a 4060 Ti for 499$, which I'm pretty sure they could have - but of course, no point where ***cough*** AI ***cough***.",
      "Note the RT data is quite skewed towards Cyberpunk. They even included RT overdrive benchmarks for w/e reason which was never meant to run on Radeon lmao... even with Cyberpunk benchmarked **4 times** out of the 9 results, the RDNA3 GPUs are still holding up against their counterpart in RT. If you ignore Cyberpunk overdrive, 7700xt is 1.875% faster than 4060ti on average in RT (with Cyberpunk being benched 3 times). The 7800xt would be 4.375% slower than the 4070 in RT as well.\n\nThat brings me to conclude that the 7700xt is actually decent value vs 4060ti 16 GB on paper even if they are both \\~$450. With the 4060ti, you mainly gain DLSS 2 and 3, which isn't always present in all games (or you can pay for it lol ...), and 4GB more VRAM. The 7700xt has roughly equal RT and 15% better Raster on the other hand.",

That's solid value (yes not amazing, but reasonable). 500$ is a price many people can afford for a GPU, and now you can get a solid 1440p experience or even 4K for that price.",
      "Yeah, it’s decent in isolation. I’m still kind of annoyed that this particular generational uplift took nearly *three years*, but at least it is one. That hasn’t happened since the 3060 Ti, maybe the 7600 if we’re being generous.",
      "The same people defending the 4060 will be screaming the 7800xt is bad value.",

Ie if you just picked cyberpunk path tracing and one non RT game, the 4070 would be \"AVG 60% faster\" than the AMD card.\nLikewise, they could leave CP2077 PT out and avg RT performance suddenly looks a lot better for AMD.\n\nNevertheless they look like competitive options (though I don't understand why anyone would buy the 7700xt for $50 less).",
      "The main reason that happened was oversupply of last gen stock, so AMD fronted the generational value uplift via discounts, then slotted in these two more or less based on that.\n\nPersonally, even if it makes reviews boring, this strategy is **far** more customer friendly than the typical one. These GPU's are designed, and prototypes are made WAY ahead of time, so selling you reheated leftovers for full price one day and then immediately launching something that makes that price look silly is kind of entrapment...\n\nThey would have came out earlier, but people were incensed that last gen clearance pricing was better value than the 7600 (since last gen is more expensive to make for a given tier of performance so selling through it is top priority).\n\nSo since everyone told AMD that launching the 7600 when they did was an unwinnable situation, they held off releasing these two until last gen products were almost out of stock.",
      "7700XT is a bad value at 449.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7800XT at 499 is OK",
      "They're both completely fine nowadays. Both have AV1 for streaming and content creation, and AMD's RT is perfectly fine as well, just slower than Nvidia on matching tiers. It really comes down to personal preference.",
      "fwiw, the average RT scores (which tbf, are not in the original data, but videocardz's summary) are unfairly biased by cyberpunk being included 4 times in the overall averages (i mean, all these games are cherry picked to a certain degree, but having the worst AMD performing game included multiple times is particularly egregious)   \n  \nIf only RT ultra is included, which seems reasonable since the 4070 only manages 18fps in overdrive, the 7800xt vs  4070 changes to -4.3% in RT, and overall to +3%. \n  \nNot a big practical difference either way - I just don't like seeing averages just being applied blindly!",

    "selftext": "I am on this boat. But every week that goes by, I see myself close to jumping off from it.   \n\n\nI will give some thoughts and I would be happy to be proven wrong, and that the 7700/7800 are worth the wait, but I am finding it hard to justify. Here we go:  \n\n\n1. The upper tier of RX 6000 cards are being priced very aggressively as of lately. Namely the 6800XT and the 6950XT. Besides, we pretty much know that whatever price/performance ratio the 7700 and 7800 offer at launch, it is unlikely the beat the discounted 6000 cards. The 7600 vs 6600XT/6650XT was a good example of that.  \n\n2. Free Premium Starfield. That is a $100 game being offered with upper tier RX 6000 cards and we can't tell for sure whether it will be offered with the 7700/7800 cards. These cards are unlikely to be released before Starfield is (which is just 7 weeks away). Moreover, 2023 has been an incredible year for gaming - arguably the best year out of the last 5 years, if not longer. Some are suggesting it is the best year for gaming ever. That might be a stretch. Regardless, each month of this year that goes by without a GPU upgrade, well, it kinda sucks.  \n\n3. RDNA3 offers no significant technological improvement over RDNA2, other than a small performance/watt gain. FSR3 will work for both. Memory (a strong selling point for AMD) won't improve either: the 7800/XT will offer the same memory capacity as the 6800/XT.  \n\n4. AMD is not necessarily under pressure. Their stocks are doing pretty well - the only time in history they were higher was during the peak of the mining boom. Nowadays AI is where the money is. GPUs for gaming is not AMD's top priority, whether we like it or not.",
    "comments": [
      "Your point 4 is incorrect.\n\nThey are under pressure. IP that has been developed and productized needs to make a ROI. Every month it waits, is another month that AMD is losing out on revenue.\n\nIt is likely that AMD is trying to get rid of its 6xxx stock.\n\nBut yeah, I wouldnt wait. The deals are too good right now.",
      "Is the cheapest, on sale RX 7900xtx still $900+?\n\nThen I have no trouble waiting.",
      "I was considering waiting, but looking their product stack and their pricing, there's literally nothing they could release that would be better then a 4070 for me.\n\nI would pretty much need to get a 7900xt performance wise, but using less power, for the price of a 4070, to want to give up the ray tracing performance, DLSS, cuda, reflex, and other nice Nvidia features. Those features really put in work and I'm tired of getting second class support all in the effort of raster performance. We're well past the point of raster being the only thing that matters, I'd happily give up 10-15% or more of my performance if it meant the card was better in all other aspects, and unfortunately that's the position I'm in with Nvidia and AMD.\n\nThis coming from someone currently on a 5700XT. When I bought that card over a 2070 super, ray tracing and DLSS were jokes. But if I could know how much better they were gonna get in the future I would have happily spent more on the 2070s.\n\nThat, and AMD's pricing here in Canada sucks right now anyways and I couldn't get a 6950XT for anywhere close to the price of a 4070 even if I did want that card, which I don't.",
      "What are you even talking about?\n\n> *nothing* is standard except the VRAM config\n\nThey are literally all the exact same card and will perform within 5% of each other, the only difference is the coolers and the warranty. \n\nPaying extra for better overbuilt coolers is stupid, you won’t get any better performance.",
      "I can understand someone not wanting the 6950xt due to the high power consumption, but the 6800xt is much more reasonable, and is appearing at or below $500 right now. Not much point in waiting. I got mine for $479 a couple months ago.",
      ">Moreover, 2023 has been an incredible year for gaming - arguably the best year out of the last 5 years, if not longer. Some are suggesting it is the best year for gaming ever. \n\nWait, what? Did I miss something? What games are you talking about to call it \"best year for gaming ever\"?",
      "Agreed, I think they're really missing out a chance to grab the 2023 mid-range GPU market by the balls. I'm in a similar boat as OP's except I'm waiting on a bit of money to come in which I will use to make a purchase and I've been crossing my fingers for a 7700xt release. Really didn't want to buy 2+ year old hardware. Sigh",
      "> Really didn't want to buy 2+ year old hardware. Sigh\n\nTheres always pros and cons to buying brand new hardware. 7000 drivers were a mess at launch and it took months to fix them. Meanwhile, 6000 series drivers have been stable for well over a year. Another example, when I got my 5900x and x570 mobo in late 2020 (when 5000 series cpus launched), my ram wouldnt run at the frequency advertised (3600 mhz) without my system crashing like crazy. I had to run it at 3200 for over 6 months until there was a bios update that fixed it. So I ended up losing performance and paid for something I couldnt fully use for 6+ months. New tech is almost always overpriced at and around launch too.\n\nI get the allure of buying the brand new, shiny thing, but is it really that big of a deal to buy 2+ year old hardware? When you go car shopping, do you only look at the 2023 models and ignore everything 2021 and earlier? Even if you get most of the performance/features for a lot less money? What about TVs or monitors? The latest lg c3 is 25% more money than a c2 and has marginal performance increases at best. Most would say it's a waste of money to buy the c3 over the c2. \n\nI just think we need to change our mentality when it comes to these things. You shouldnt feel bad because youre buying something thats a couple years old. Especially when that thing thats a couple years old is priced well and is a big performance increase to whatever youre currently using.",

The 4k ones are close, but both cards are eating shit and dying at 4k RT (FPS in the 15-30 range), so not really relevant as no one would be running those settings.\n\nIt should also be noted that while the GRE is a faster card, it takes a bigger hit to FPS when using RT. This allows the slower 4070super to, generally, pull a pretty decent lead in RT.\n\nEither card would be a solid buy.

Why doesn't test the high settings with RT in Ratchet and Clank? Why doesn't he move down to balanced DLSS that still looks better than quality FSR? If he says that 76 fps is \"borderline\" playable with frame gen due to latency, how come he doesn't show the latency on the 7900GRE without Nvidia's Reflex technology. \n\nThe thing with this channel, and most techtubers, is that they tend to downplay Nvidia's advantages, and oversell AMD's. This is not surprising, they must present things as more of an equal footing for their audience. For narrative reasons, if there is an underdog, it must be plucky one.",
      "16 vs 12 GB of VRAM. That should make the AMD cards usable for one or two more years. 290/390/4x0/5x0 are still usable today if they are the 8GB variant. Those are up to a decade old now.",

      "> It's crazy how people talk because in the latest generation while Nvidia definitely still maintains a lead it's not as big as it used to be.\n\nThe advantage is still there just not as visible when you test it in \"we have RT at home\" games like F1, Far Cry or Spiderman. In Alan Wake 2 or cp77 rtx was 50% faster. Other than that, 7900 GRE have 33% more RT cores than 7800xt, the card which is a closer competitor in raster to 4070.",

The front to back push-pull air configuration works best for air coolers, and maintains positive pressure.\n\nEdit: nvm about the negative pressure, didn’t realize it was the Lancool 216, but it would still be a good idea to drop at least two of those top fans, if not all three, going with an air cooler",

Straight horizontal push-pull setup, assuming you have a positive pressure system, means that most of the hot air will exit through the back of the case and not interfere with the CPU cooler.\n\nAnd on top of that, having a negative pressure case will lead to the issue of heat recycling, since the case will naturally suck in air through cracks and crevices, and some of that air will be freshly exhausted, heated air. You always want to make sure you have more intake than exhaust, but not too much more.",

If a 7800 is the same or slightly better than a 6800xt for $499, with some newer features and more efficiency, then that’s a pretty good offering, and a good improvement over previous gen price to performance.\n\nAt $549 it’s not BAD, it’s just not that exciting.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI was trying to optimize the efficiency of my AMD card and wondered why I can't set a lower power target than -10%. So I started benchmarking with different max clock speeds. I don't know if this is good in \"real life gaming\" performance, but I did it on the fly and just thought I could post it on reddit as well. (Spoiler: Yes, it's amazing!)\n\nKeep in mind that the specified clock rates are those that I have set in the software and that the real clock rates are somewhat higher. I also only ran the tests in a 3DMark test, as it is pleasantly short.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Model:** ASRock Radeon RX 7800 XT Steel Legend 16GB OC (90-GA4RZZ-00UANF)\n* **Driver:** 24.1.1\n* **Benchmark:** 3DMark - Solar Bay Custom 1440p, Fullscreen (no Async/Vsync)\n* **Tool:** AMD Adrenalin Software\n* **Default Card Settings:** Power Target: -10%; Voltage: 1.070V\n* **Watt:** average consumption in GPU-Z (by eye)\n* **ppw:** points per watt\n* **clock speed:** corresponds to what I have set in the program; real clock frequency was 100-120 MHz higher due to the lower GPU voltage.\n\n# Scores:\n\n**Stock:** 74 125 - 276W - 268,6 ppw\n\n**Default:** 77 211 - 250W - 308,8 ppw\n\n**1700 MHz\\*:** 44 898 - 130W - 345,4 ppw\n\n**1750 MHz:** 61 222 - 167W - 366,6 ppw\n\n**1800 MHz:** 62 337 - 170W - 366,7 ppw\n\n**1900 MHz:** 65 702 - 177W - **371,2 ppw**\n\n**2000 MHz:** 68 388 - 185W - 369,7 ppw\n\n**2100 MHz:** 70 397 - 195W - 361,0 ppw\n\n**2200 MHz:** 72 539 - 205W - 353,8 ppw\n\n**2300 MHz:** 74 704 - 220W - 339,6 ppw\n\n*\\*real clock was just 1275 MHz*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn its original state, the RX 7800 XT only achieves an efficiency of 268.6 points per watt. My best result at 1900 MHz is 371.2 points per watt (+38%). Comparing the relative power consumption with the stock settings, the card would consumes only 200W instead of 276W (stock score divided by best points per watt value).\n\nThe reduction of the relative power consumption to 72.5% is in my opinion extreme potential. The card is at least as good as Nvidia's RTX 40 cards whose power target would be set to \"70%\". In absolute numbers, this means: With 1900 MHz, 1.070v and \"-10%\" power target, the **FPS loss is 11.4%** while the **power consumption is only 64.1%.**\n\n# Screenshots from Starfield:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zmmh18byrufc1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4bb30ebaa7ab17d2ece426747f141facdf45cca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ku1w4abyrufc1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6599acf16b77213a0f85aaa021aec7d2d53541",

      "Lol, If I UnderVolt my 7900XT it does NOTHING for me if I don’t reduce my already EXTREMELY high Boost clocks from “stock” approx 2860 down to about 2700 or 2600 is then where I see a reduction in power with minimal fps loss maybe 2-4fps",
      "Thank you! But that's nothing special imho. From what I've heard, many people already undervolt their GPUs with lower power target, so oddly this doesn't really seem to be a thing. But I haven't really bothered with overclocking for 10 years because the benefits have always been quite small these days.\n\nMaybe I'm just oldschool and there aren't that many people who care about efficiency anymore. Don't get me wrong, I'm the typical OC guy from 2006-2012 when hardware in general had much worse efficiency. But nowadays all manufacturers overdo it and mid-range products already consume 200-300W. And entry-level models consume less, but in some cases there is no trace of efficiency anymore... Yes i look at you, RX 7600 XT with 190W!\n\nAMD may not have optimized the cards well, but I am very happy that RDNA3 itself is great.",
      "I was able to reduce my overall power consumption and increase my max core clocks on my 6800 XT by doing an undervolt. I don't think setting a power target would be nearly as good as a proper undervolt for AMD GPUs. Taking some voltage away allows the core to boost higher and use less power so a power limit shouldn't be necessary. I think I knocked off like 30-60w on my 6800 XT and got \\~10% more performance with the undervolt. I also went through this with my 4090. Yes, I know the architecture is different but I got the same results as my 6800 XT in terms of doing a proper undervolt rather than power limiting which knocked off about 50-100w depending on the situation and I gained \\~3% performance. Undervolting should always be better than power limiting from my experience and I have been overclocking GPUs since the 3DFX VooDoo 2. AMD in particular is really damn good with undervolting - both their GPUs and CPUs.",
      ">Everybody is going to hate this analogy, but AMD factory tunes their GPUs to be muscle cars, they don't have Tensor Cores or CUDA Cores or PhysX chips or what have you, so they make up for the difference with software optimizations and raw horsepower.\n\nWell I don't really think that's quite accurate, it's more like a base model or mid spec car vs fully loaded/top trim, you get the same on-road performance, without all of the bells and whistles and maybe flashy coat of paint that the  Nvidia cards come with.\n\nI also don't understand where this notion that AMD cards have more 'raw horsepower' comes from or what it's founded in. They're just more basic/less frills gaming focused cards, which if anything, simply have a larger fuel tank (more VRAM). I'll note you didn't say more, you just said raw horsepower, but I've seen that term used (often with the word more) since RDNA2.",
      "Same with my xtx at stock it tries to boost to 3gz and consumes an ungodly amount of power. I limit it to 2650 and see a reduction of about 50-70 w with no real loss in performance",
      "You can of course do both, underclock for efficiency or to increase/hold performance, but since the cards are so far from the sweet spot, it's more profitable for me to limit the performance.\n\n// Btw:  Lowering the voltage in AMD Adrenaline actually is like an offset and i guess it works as a percentage. In other words, lowering the voltage from 1.150v to 1.070v (93%) also reduces the voltage in games from e.g. 0.900v to 0.837v. That's why it's so rewarding to explore the sweet spot.\n\n// 1. feb 24 // It seems under a specific threshhold it is not like an offset. I testet it now with 1.000v and 1.070v. The real life voltage was in both settings 0,783v in FireStrike with 100% GPU Load. Imho the typical weird AMD OC/UV behavior, sadly it is kinda restricted. But the results are still very nice.",
      "Intel is on-par to cheaper than AMD now. (K vs. X parts, X3D parts are another price level above)\n\nGolden Cove/Raptor Cove cores (P cores) are, when properly tuned, better clock for clock and watt for watt than Zen4 - except for cases where AVX512 comes into play.\n\nHowever the E cores, despite being labelled 'efficient' are really only efficient on die area, they're far less power efficient than the P cores. \n\nZen3 was already more area efficient than Golden Cove, Zen4 just makes that worse for Intel - so to keep performance parity without making massive dies that cost too much to sell, they're pumping more E cores which hurt overall power efficiency.",
      "Yeah, RDNA3 sort of missed the mark on improving efficiency over RDNA2, even with the move to N5 (though chiplets aren't helping either). 1900-2000MHz is also where my 6950XT consumes less power, but still offers good performance. 2400-2600MHz is where it will eat power like crazy and use the entire +20% power budget even with undervolting.\n\nThere are cases, though, where the lower clocks may cause slight microstuttering (2160p) in RDNA2 (not sure if RDNA3 has this) that completely goes away once clocks are raised again. There may be architectural design reasons for that where timing targets (in clock cycles) were relaxed for certain pipelines or pipeline stages were added to improve high clock tolerance (common design decisions). Performance critical pipelines likely retain tight timing, short wire lengths, and no increase in pipeline stages to keep ALU throughputs and performance per watt competitive. However, architecture is always limited by the weakest link in the chain.\n\nEDIT: One interesting thing I've noticed in both AMD and Nvidia architectures is that large opaque textures/objects (like a body of water with high pixel coverage or a running river with moving translucent pixels) cause increased power consumption even if overall scene/geometry/object load hasn't increased. Alpha blending has been a power virus since the beginning of 3D acceleration and I wonder if anything can be done to fix that in future architectures. I mean, deferred rendering breaks this entirely, but I wonder if there's a way to make (forward rendered) alpha heavy pixels more efficient, maybe through hardware in an adjacent pixel interpolation pass? Basically trying to cut the amount of alpha blended pixels rendered through inferencing/interpolation.",
      "Yeah. These cards try to hit high boost clocks at all costs. Limiting how far they can clock pays dividends while only costing a couple of frames. I had my 7900 XT undervolted and limited to 2400MHz and those power savings were rather absurd in a lot of cases. I’d slash around 60-100 watts of power (and I’d get a much cooler running card) while still getting the performance I want.",
      ">Everybody is going to hate this analogy, but AMD factory tunes their GPUs to be muscle cars,\n\nApparently though, it's not OK when Intel does the same thing.",
      "Because on heavy tessellation workloads the 400 series ran circles around anything AMD offered back then and for the next gen too.\n\n\nAt the end of the day people only cares about performance and totally ignore efficiency, who could imagine that? *Looks out of the windows to thousands of cars with a single driver moving slowly than walking people*",

      "Yeah same here, however power is cheap where I live, so we send it. After that brutal cold snap last month with heater going, 2 gaming PCs, 2 tvs and electric stove my power bill was only 120 bucks.",
      ">I think that says something about AMD’s out of the box settings\n\nNot necessarily - it could also be saying that OP’s 7800XT has much better performance than the minimum bin AMD chose for that SKU. Without a large scale investigation, it’d be very difficult to figure out. In general I do think AMD cards are usually released with power levels that are too high, but 27% may not be what you’d typically gain.",

      "You will probably go WAY lower than 1900MHz@1.070V.\n\nMy 6800XT is on 2255MHz core clock at 1.007V or 2170MHz@0.963V stable. You will probably be fine at 0.9V or around that.\n\nRemember, what **really** saves energy is voltage, not frequency. P = U^2 / R, as per school physics program. It's a quadratic relation. So, by increasing voltage by 10%, you increase power consumption by 21%. By lowering it by 20%, you lower core power consumption by 36%.\n\nThus, you need to measure it in a different way. You lower BOTH frequency and voltage, define if it's stable, THEN you measure efficiency. This is really a correct way to conduct this  test.",
      "Unlike in this case, however, you usually have to be very clever.",
      "I see what you mean, I have issues with the analogy still but it makes more sense this way. \n\nFWIW I've found many Nvidia GPU's to be the same, stock tuning is right at the tip of performance using more power than it needs, seems like any contemporary GPU from either camp benefits from tuning, but perhaps AMD more so.",

A third tier Navi 32 is of course an option, but the confusing pricing of the 7700XT (and quite frankly, the stupid naming of the entire lineup) makes me think that they don’t want to price any of their chiplet designs any lower for whatever reason - more likely capacity than cost, but it could be either.\n\nFaster Navi 33 seems unlikely as the boost clock is already the highest in the lineup.

      "I thought so too at first, but honestly having a better look at it i don’t anymore, but granted i might just be coping.\n\nThe 7900GRE appears to be barely offering 10% more performance for also about 10% more in terms of the price for what appears to be an inferior quality build compared to my Nitro+ 7800 XT, which i know has (imo) awesome cooling capabilities as well as it handles undervolting and overclocking like a champ so ultimately that difference in raw performance may very well be much smaller than 10%, and while i have no idea regarding the OC capabilities of the GRE overall I remain content with my purchase for the time being.",
      "it's similar to a 7800xt",
      "So finally the true 7800 XT is going on sale worldwide.\n\nAMD really messed up with their naming scheme this generation by creating the unecessary XTX SKU...",
      "One thing to watch out for with this one is overclocking potential.  They stated the power limit will be limited to 260W.  If that's the case and there's no easy way to get around it even on custom AIB cards that's gonna limit it severely because of how overclocking works on RDNA 3.  \n\nIf not for bullshit artificial limits, these would probably be really good overclockers given the low stock clocks.  OC vs OC you'd probably be looking at more like a 15-20% performance advantage for the 7900 GRE vs the 7800 XT if you can OC the memory on the 7900 GRE a fair bit, and it would significantly close the gap to the stock 7900 XT which is what makes me think AMD will be assholes and artificially limit OC via firmware on these.\n\nFully expect that availability on these will be low as well, just as it was for the RX 6800.  The reason is that this is a die that's already been cut down to make the 7900 XT, in similar fashion to how Navi 21 was cut down to make the 6800 XT and even more cut down to make the RX 6800.",
      "the naming scheme this gen has been abysmal, they had it almost right with the 6000 series but i guess if you can't compete confuse the end users.",

      "MSRP + $100 incoming...",
      "Just please keep them as close to MSRP as possible. Especially the white because we all know there is usually a ridiculous added charge on white gpus",
      "Jake,\n\nA 850W PSU is recommended for the 7800XT...is that a mistake?\n\nWhen will the clock speeds be announced?\n\nThanks.",
      "1. The cards look great,  but tbh they need to stay as close to MSRP as possible,  or else they're DOA.   \n2. The white model looks the best in my opinion, but I don't like the yellowish logos.   \n3. A giveaway would be a good way to connect with consumers and give back to the community.  Just saying ;)",
      "Considering that the Suggested PSU for 7900 XT is 700W (750W in the ASUS PSU Table), that should be a huge overestimation.",
      "If they cost 10% more than MSRP then they're not worth it",
      "This, unfortunately. White is a real pain and challenge to get the color matching perfectly. Black blends better but white shows everything and even a slightly different hue can be apparent.",
      "That seems like an oversight to me OR that the article was written prior to actually receiving confirmed numbers, which is likely. I’ll pass this along. Like u/poppoo143 mentioned, the higher tier card already states a lower wattage psu.",
      "Personally I feel like the TUF Gaming line as a whole is missing on an opportunity to distance itself from \"gaming\" and be a sleeker more minimalist brand (as it is your cheaper option). I think at this point the whole \"gaming\" marketing in the computer component world is very oversaturated and as of today you could go as far as calling it \"gimicky.\" I'm a gamer, I don't need my components to say it on them. I'm aware I can game on my GPU and Mobo, that is what I bought it for after all. You already have the ROG brand, the TUF Gaming brand is starting to = cheaper asus brand, more than just gaming computer components which I think was the original intention when TUF Gaming launched.\n\nSimply put, if I were the VP of marketing I'd drop \"Gaming\" from \"TUF\" and try to capitalize on the anti-rgb movement and have it be a minimalist, sleek line and pivot from the \"cheap, downgraded ROG\" line that it has become synonymous with. Kind of like pro-art, but again not targeting any specific group. Let's be real, it's not like the consumer hardware itself would physically change if gaming was the focus or not. No board partner made \"mining\" focused hardware brands for example. Your Pro-art GPU dies aren't any different from your TUF or ROG brands.\n\nI would never buy Asus TUF Gaming branded products new unless they were steeply discounted, which is almost never the case, because I assume they're just intentionally built worse than they could be and usually they're not priced as such. And conversely I'd never buy your Strix brand new because I assume that the relative performance increase doesn't align with the price increase. Maybe what I'm asking for is to merge TUF and Pro-art into an economy brand, that is a general economy brand, priced at the bottom of the stack that doesn't feel \"gimicky and intentionally cheaper.\" Like a brand I'd buy for myself and not my 8 year old nephew because he can't have nice things yet. A big part of the problem is the Strix line is infamously overpriced at this point so it makes the TUF Gaming line seem way worse than it is.\n\nYour competitors do a much better job of differentiating and blending their brand tiers in my opinion. Take MSI for example, they have the ventus, Gaming trio & Suprim cards. When I think of the two Asus brands I think of intentionally worse thus overpriced gaming, and very overpriced, high quality gaming. MSI? Ventus is cheap and crappy, gaming trio is more expensive but performs to that bump while establishing a middle ground and then suprim is splurge. Not to say Strix doesn't compete with Suprim, but there's no middle ground for Asus and the juxtaposition between TUF and ROG is too big and obvious. MSI boards? I couldn't even tell you how that branding works, but all I know is they're not clearly pitted against each other as cheap vs overpriced. And Asus mobos still aren't out of the woods from voltage-gate from a public perception standpoint. ASRock? Same story as MSI, unique branding, no \"gaming\" overkill and sensible tiering.",
      "We should have pricing soon and I’ll update when we do. Part of why we’ve targeted the TUF series was to help keep prices a bit more reasonable compared to some other options.",
      "Recommended means nothing dude. I have a 850w psu for my 7900xtx. You're 750w psu is more than enough.",
      "It’s actually not ridiculous for white to be a more expensive color. It is harder to get good yields on white injection molded parts and painted parts. Which means either parts are rejected and then scrapped or reworked. In either case that leads to more money be necessary to make a unit. The auto industry does similar. The white colors tend to be an up charge color.",
      "Haha giveaways aren’t off the table though my personal preference is to first have some open and honest dialogue. Giveaways can muddy the waters on feedback and honest discussion.\n\nThanks for the feedback on the cards!",
      "I would like to know whether the coolers are repurposed nvidia ones or not. Some ASUS radeon cards have coolers designed for nvidia models, probably to save cost of development idk.",
      "Bro 3080 10GB is arguably the worst to get right now, the 7800xt will probably match its performance or slightly supersede with 6GB more vram for proper 2k or 4k textures in the near future. \n\nThese recommendations are really meant for typical buyers who usually have shitty Psu ... for example a noname 850w psu (such as that infamous series from Gigabyte) cannot match a solid 650w from FSP. Hence, they have to inflate these recommendation numbers in case some dumb ass uses these no name psus\n\nJust have a solid 650-700w and you should be fine with these mid range gpu",
      "Car paint =/= plastic parts for GPU.\n\nAlso white color isn't always the cheapest for cars, sometimes you need to pay extra for white.",
      "I like the rgb, it's not over the top. Looking at an 7800xt for a friend just waiting on availability and price in NZ, really happy with my tuf xtx",
      "I could probably find some info and other bits to sell you on a snazzy new gen card, BUT I think you’ve actually answered this yourself. The RX 6800 is cheaper and does the job you need, it sounds like? If so, that’s likely the best option for you. I’ll usually advocate a little bit for new versus used because of warranties, but when it comes to the generation and tier level, I’ll always suggest to choose what fits your needs and wants. \n\nIf you need to play X game at Y resolution, then base the purchase on that. \n\nIf you want a shiny new toy, then buy what you’ll have fun with within your budget. No need to justify your own expenses for fun.",
      "Your 750 should be perfectly fine I run a 7900 xt with a 750",
      "I liked the older TUF Sabertooth(X99/Z87/990FX etc.) aesthetic more than the more recent yellow TUF design. Seems like a massive downgrade.   \nROG/Strix lines seem super upcharged while being hit-or-miss quality wise."

    "title": "I get the controversy behind the mislabeling of the 7900/7800 series but why is the 7700 XT getting the same hate?",
    "selftext": "I'm seeing numerous posts on here saying that the 7700 XT is really just a 7700 or even a 7600 XT class card. Heck, even the 7600 is not spared although I think it performs fine as a 6600 successor. Are people just parroting what others online are saying?\n\nLet me break it down for you:\n\n* Architecture: They are both Nx2 classes (N32 vs N22)\n* Memory Capacity: Both 12GB\n* Memory Bus Width: 192 bit\n\nBut that's where the similarities end. It is much closer to a 6800 non-XT than it is to the 6700 XT\n\n||RX 7700 XT|RX 6700 XT|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Core Count|54 CU|40 CU|\n|Boost Clock Speed|2544 MHz|2424 MHz|\n|TDP|245W|230W|\n|MSRP|$449|$479|\n\nIMO, it a worthy successor to the 6700 XT and at a $30 discount, bringing much more features and significant performance uplift.\n\nIf anything that the 7700 XT should be guilty of is that it is priced too high or too close to the 7800 XT.\n\n**EDIT:** Again I want to clarify, not spotlighting the price (that is a separate debate), it's that people won't stop labeling it as a 7700/7600 XT. Even if they do label it as a 7700, people will complain the price is too high, but the performance would be greatly above its predecessor (6700).",
    "comments": [
      "Yeah it seems good but people are pissed it's priced so close to the 7800 XT. I think a $70-80 difference would set them apart better (either increasing one or decreasing the other).",
      "GN nailed it - at $50 gap it's not worthwhile, at $100 it's extremely compelling.",
      "You can't really compare release MSRPs because the 6700XT is now selling for $330.   \nPeople are disappointed that the 7700Xt is priced at $450 because the 7800XT is \\~20% better and 11% more expensive, essentially funneling everyone toward a higher price bracket.   \n\n\nThe 7700XT doesn't really fill a meaningful position in AMD's GPU lineup right now, at the $450 price point.",
      "Because if they released it at $400 they'd have the $330 6700xt and $350 3750xt collecting dust. Inevitably the 6000 GPUs will sell out and the 7700xt price will drop to $400 or less. Sucks but if they got stock to move they're going to price it around making it move. \n\nBasically where it sits now pushes people up to 7800XT or pushes them down to a 6750 or 6700. Once the bottom of this tier falls out (6000 series sold out and done), the price of the 7700Xt falls in response. Its pretty basic business and is done with almost every product you buy that has recurring releases.",
      "I live in Europe, and the price gap is actually roughly €100 here. The 7700 XT retails for around €520-550 and the 7800 XT is around €620-650, depending on XFX/Sapphire/Asus etc. (including all taxes and stuff).",
      "Yeah, people easily forgot what happened just a generation ago. if 7800XT is really priced that good then keep saying that 7700 should drop in price, can't the opposite also happen in which the 7800xt might actually increase in price? \n\ni am in a region where GPU prices tend to stick to what is release price and dont decrese BUT will actually increase in price if its always sold",
      "So AMD should just raise 7800xt prices! \n/s",
      ">Are people just parroting what others online are saying?\n\nthey're all saying the same thing because it's true, why would you buy the 7700 XT when you could get the bigger 7800 XT for just $80 more?\n\n$80 is a small gap for the current GPU economy today, and it's certainly better than the $170 difference between the 6700 XT vs 6800 XT.\n\nthe 7800 XT is not only faster, it also has 16GB of VRAM, quite a few RT cores and should only draw like 50-60watts more.\n\nthe 7700 XT is not a bad card, I've not seen anyone say that anywhere. it's position in the market is just weird.\nhere's hoping for a price cut for the 7700 XT.",
      "Then why would you ever buy a 7800xt or 7700xt when 6800xt is 500 brand new.",
      "Mindfactory sold many 7800 xt units for 559€, sadly other countries tend to get screwed with pricing.",
      "What a level-headed take",
      "If 7800xt rises more in price, then there is less actual incentive to chooce 7800xt over 4070 so i doubt it will go that way if amd is smart.",
      "It's even more pointless to compare it to heavily discounted 6800xt cards, that will disappear from the market in a few weeks. \nThe 7600 was compared to the 6700 10GB discounted to sub $300, which never had many cards on sale to begin with.",
      "So AMD should raise 6800xt prices too!!",
      "You can't really compare \"is now selling for\" prices either.\n\nA 6700 XT here (Philippines) is still $460. However, a 6750 XT is $440 - because the retailers got newer stock for it at a lower price. It used to be $540. It's also why a 6950 XT is cheaper than a 6800 XT.",
      "I'm so fuckin confused why every outlet insists on basing their review on MSRP and not *performance*. In 6 months none of their conclusions will make sense because the prices have shifted. \n\nI mean go watch everyone's reviews of 6700 XT or 6800 XT etc from last year. They all shit on it for being too expensive, and some even *re-reviewed* it after prices normalized. \n\nPeople use your recommendations well after launch. Like years later even. Including MSRP as a consideration is absolutely pointless beyond mentioning its current price. Because when you watch it a year later for a recommendation, suddenly the videos telling you to not buy a perfectly good card because they think it's not a good deal.",
      "Not everyone makes purchasing decisions from the mindset of \"what is the absolute maximum amount of money I can possibly spend?\"\n\nI could afford a 4090, but there's no chance Nvidia is getting $1,600 out of me. I could afford a 7950X3D, but it would be a waste. If the price:performance is close, yeah, I'll eat a bit of value for more performance (say, 30% more performance for 40% more money). However, with stuff like the 7700 XT and 7800 XT, it's easy to fit another $50 in the budget.\n\nHeck, there are times I'm debating between going all-out for a top-tier product to keep for a long time or getting something with much better value and upgrading more frequently.\n\nThat said, neither of these cards really does it for me. If the 7800 XT were $50 cheaper, I'd maybe get it. The 7700 XT needs to be more like $80-100 cheaper, IMO. If the 7800 XT comes down a bit for Black Friday, I might pick it up, but the 7700 XT has to be stupidly good value to convince me it's enough of an upgrade from my 5700 XT AND that I shouldn't just buy a 7800 XT for a little more.",
      "All that matters is current relative prices. Why would you buy a 6700xt when 6750xt is cheaper or 6800xt when 6950xt is cheaper. \n\nJust like why would we buy a 7800xt when 6800xt is cheaper. \n\nMsrp doesnt matter what matters is new avaliablity prices.  \n\nJust look back at 30 series and 6000 series releases. Msrp didnt mean a thing.",

      "Higher? The 7800xt is at the highest price to make sense at all, any higher price and the 6800xt gets a far better alternative...\nIt should be named the 7800 and the 7700xt should be a bit less.

Its holding up fine but recent games seems to struggle to much.\n\nAnd i have kind fixed budget. And I need to buy something.\n\nBest i can afford is RTX 5060 TI 16GB  or RX 7800xt (previously i have considered Intel B580 so its already a huge price increase.) So RX 9070 or RTX 4070 or 5070 is not an option)\n\nIt has to be one of those two.\n\nIn theory 7800xt destroys 5060 TI. In every gameplay i saw like 10 to 30 fps more with RX 7800xt\n\nSo its seems that choice is simple. But, (there is always but) its not that simple.\n\nA small background.\n\nI play at 1080p 60hz LCD screen or 4K 60hz TV screen (only older games - 1080ti is too weak for 4K)\n\nI have rather weak CPU i7 11600H with DDR4 3200 memory.\n\nI would not change that in near future.\n\nAnd here comes upscaling and frame generation\n\nNvidia DLSS an FG is far more superior and common than FSR3.1.\n\nAnd i think for 4K gaming even RX 7800xt will struggle to to get 60FPS without upscaling.\n\nFor newer games (GTA 6 ???) even at 1080p i guess\n\nSo card with bad upscaling is not good choice for next few years....\n\nSo although im impressed with raw performance of RX 7800xt I still consider waiting for price of 5060 TI 16GB decrease, so it will be cheaper than RX 7800xt\n\nBut choice has to be made.\n\nWhich one would you buy?",

The 7800 xt is stuck with FSR 3.1 (which is abysmal), is less efficient, and performs worse with RT on (unless it's a super light, and therefore pointless rt implementation). The 5060 ti should overclock quite easily to just about match a 4070 in raw performance (not that far off of the 7800xt).\n\nEdit: It may also be worth sticking with your 1080 ti for just a bit longer and saving enough to get a 9070, 9070 xt, or 5070 ti",
      "Tbh the 5060ti 16gb makes more sense to me, yes the 7800xt is a bit faster, but i think the current version of DLSS grants a bigger advantage.

      "In truth, you’re asking if you should buy the midrange card (7800XT) or the budget option from the newest series (5060TI) which is purely up to you. Me though, I wouldn’t spend an equivalent amount on the budget option when you have a midrange card capable of some great raster performance available to you. Your cpu isn’t all that weak, and there’s nothing wrong with ddr4 memory, your cpu gets some pretty decent price to performance and in truth I don’t understand why you think you’ll need any kind of frame gen. If you want frames and raw performance, the 7800XT is your choice, if you *want* to use frame gen and have slightly less frames without using that feature then you should get the 5060TI. My choice would be the 7800XT though. I use it right now with a 9600x and I’m pushing the last of us part one with the settings cranked as high as they’ll go in 1080p well over 90-120 frames. Keep in mind ray tracing isn’t available in every game and that’s the reason (outside of greed) why nvidia costs so much.",

      "It helps a lot and it's doing it with much better results than fsr3.1. if fsr 4 was available for rx 7800 than it will be much simpler choice. But we don't when  it will be (and if it will be because it's not clear)\nFor recent games it's seems like Rx will better choice, but for future releases? Not so sure",
      "As you can see it's hard choice :) \nAbout budget. It's not that I can't afford more expensive card. If I want to I can go and buy 5090 out of the shelf. It's that I think it's not worth it. I'm not heavy player. But I do like to play occasionally. To buy better card I will have to replace screen, cpu ,motherboard, memory and psu to make it sense. So it's pointless to buy better card ither than those two mentioned in my opinion.\nAbout DLLs and performance. My nephew has a rtx 4060 paired with Ryzen 5600.\nI was amazed what this setup can do with dlss on cyberpunk or last of us compared to what I was getting with my 1080ti\nThat the performance that I was looking for.\nAnd I almost bought 4060.\nBut then Intel b580 came out.\nI almost bought it :) . But It was little overpriced at the beginning. So I decided to wait. And then came Nvidia 50xx card release with 5060 announcement.\nI thought I will wait a little bit longer.\nAnd now when it's released I almost bought it :)\nBut I watched YouTube video with comparsion to rx 7800, where red team destroys green:)\nBut it was with very strong processor of course, without using DLLs or fsr , no RT.\nSo after all this digging in internet I still don't know ...

      "I have used both and really only started getting fed up with Nvidia with extreme prices and planned obsolescence because they use a smaller amount of memory. This is on purpose as its not a huge cost. So use what you want. Nobody will be able to afford upgrades soon. Get a card with the most ram.",
      "If you don't want to wait 7800xt.\nAt 4k FSR3.1 is not bad. Yes DLSS is more available but you can always optiscaler to try to inject FSR.\nNewer game that still lack any info can be as bad as optimized as it can be that 5060ti struggle alot even with DLSS and the excess performance of 7800XT might help especially in 4k.\nFor a rather old title, your best bet is using Lossless scaling in my opinion anyway.\nBut since AMD haven't yet release it's 9060xt, there is also option to wait for a bit to see how it's performance and hopefully at that point 5060ti/7800xt price also going down.\nSo more options as well.\n\nFor for now, my pick would be 7800xt.\nUnless you care about RT or efficiency (5060ti is a very efficient card) but probably wait is also a better choice.",
      "I have both. 5060ti in my main rig, and a 7800xt in our lounge gaming PC. I play at 1440p on the main PC, and the 7800xt at 4K in the lounge PC.\n\nThe 7800xt plays games like dragon age Veilguard and AC shadows at 60fps with some settings tweaks or frame gen. I generally steer clear of upscaling as I don’t like the artifacts it creates and FSR3 is pretty mid, however XeSS can be used by any card just like FSR3, and it looks a lot better imo especially at 4K.\n\nI think the 7800xt is a better option for 4K as it has more brute strength in terms of rasterisation. I’m happy with what I use it for. \n\nHowever, DLSS4 is very impressive, the best upscaling I’ve seen so far. It’s not perfect though, there are still artifacts etc, just a lot less than DLSS3. \n\nI personally use the 5060ti for high fps at 1440p, as it has more dials to turn as DLSS is more viable to use. I really don’t like upscaling in general, but especially at lower resolutions and DLSS is better at lower resolutions. I also chose it as it’s my main PC and it runs a fair bit more efficiently, and my main PC gets used a lot more than the lounge PC. The 5060ti sits at anywhere between 150-190w whereas the 7800xt is more like 190-250w.\n\nPersonally since you don’t utilise high fps in either situation, the 7800xt is a better option for you as it’s more capable at 4K. If DLSS or power efficiency is a major point of contention for you then maybe consider the 5060ti.",

      "You’re not missing anything",
      "Only thing this is good for is pushing the 7800xt price down to $450",
      "the argument is that by using the name “7900xtx” and creating a whole new segment (last gen topped out at 6900xt/6950xt not xtx) that it screwed up the whole alignment of the stack with respect to the actual performance of the products. The 7900XTX was not a 4090 competitor, they said that from day 1, so *creating a whole new segment on the top of the existing 6000 series for it* probably was not justified... and once you're committed to the XTX branding, it drags the whole rest of the line around, otherwise you get weird gaps.  \n\n7800xt for example barely outperforms 6800XT, and you can view that as a result of the top of the stack being too high and everything having to slide upward to fit. That 7800xt could have been called a 7700xt and then it’d have a sensible generational gain.\n\nOn the other hand I think this downplays the fact that AMD probably didn’t want to charge 7700xt prices for it at launch etc.  If it doesn’t use significantly less/cheaper silicon than the 6800xt, AMD can’t really reduce prices all that much. And remember they still knocked $150 off the original msrp of the 6800xt already… and 6800xt was not really inflated at all.  The 7800XT already launched at \"almost\" 6700XT pricing.  The naming isn't what matters, at the end of the day it's pricing that matters, and unless the lower names came with lower prices it wouldn't really change anything.\n\nPricing and naming has become this Rorschach blot though, everyone knows its “too high because of the pandemic/mining” but this allows people to impose whatever number *they think it should have been* and the reality is most SKUs aren’t gouged as much as people wanted them to be. 6700xt launched at $480 but probably never would have been less than $420 or $399 even without gouging… but people imagine that it would have launched at the current (clearance) pricing or something.  It would absolutely never have launched at $330 or $299.\n\nAnd I think that's the unacknowledged problem with this theory... if you call cutdown N31 as \"7800XT\" then you have that product segment going from $649 MSRP with 6800XT to $900 MSRP with 7800XT and that's bad optics for AMD too.  Even if you assume it launched at the \"real price\" of $749, that's still a $100 price increase over RDNA2.  7700XT (full-die N32) at $499 would have been a $20 increase over \"already gouged\" 6700XT pricing.  Etc. \n\nAMD is not immune to the price increases taking place either, they just went with \"shrinkflation\" (smaller generational performance increases) instead of outright price increases.  Basically instead of increasing prices they slid everything down a tier and then cut prices a bit so people would \"feel like\" prices went down after mining, despite a lot of that actually being the shrinkflation...",

      "if you think 15% improvement in 2 years at the same price it's good, well that's a problem.\n\nmaybe because there is a lot of people like you out there the companies letting themselves keep raising prices like crazy and give us poor value for money",

If 7900xtx can beat 4080 in most cases then it's a fantastic card and as far as I am concerned 4080 is in a different price bracket.

They got greedy and decided to upcharge by naming the 7900 XT what they did to reap more profit, they get what they deserve really. A \"poor\" generational uplift in terms of performance when comparing the 7800 XT to the 6800 XT in reviews because of a dumb naming scheme.",
      "I believe the simple answer is that they actually wanted to get rid of the non xt versions. I really think the non xt's were a \"necessary\" evil during the GPU shortage simply because it allowed more product segmentation and allowed them to increase profits(6800's are just 6800xt's that were underperforming) so they didnt have to sell them as 6700xt's. \n\nNow we are over the shortage issues they want to get rid of non xt's for branding and simplifcation which i think is fine. The fact that the 7800xt looks \"bad\" compared to the 6800xt is just a reality and its a fair critisism but its a minor one as 6800xt was already a really good gpu at the price so a modernized version isnt bad per se, but from a consumer standpoint every GPU should have been a notch, in nvidia's case sometimes 2 notches, below what they actually are. Its just a reality of current gen GPU's. In the end price to performance is king and 7800xt is a good GPU.",

Especially since some countries never dropped the price of 6800 XT (still $680+ in the Philippines).

By the time FSR 3 comes out DLSS 3.0 will have matured and have made its way into games, basically meaning FSR 3.0 is probably going to have the same issue as previous iterations—adoption rate. Next problem will be RT performance, power consumption, content creation, and probably pricing to compete. \n\nAs seen with the comparison between the 4070Ti and 7900XT, rasterization performance alone isn’t going to sell a lot of cards, feature sets are going to dictate what card has better value. \n\nI had high hopes for AMD with the 7xxx series, but when I see basically normal generational steps up with their lineup while not pushing the envelop and charging high prices, it really disheartened me. \n\nNvidia, while still expensive, saw some nice gains, especially in the 4070Ti, while also bringing out a much more robust feature set at launch, and nailing the power consumption, unlike AMD that just keeps promising, is why I chose Nvidia this time around. \n\nC’mon AMD, innovate! Quit copying Nvidia while being late to the party. You only get one first impression and they seriously need to up their game in that department.",

I feel like there's WAAAAY too much gaslighting on hardware subs on this site over high GPU prices. \n\nI mean, if they sell, you got the free market bootlickers going \"well ackshuilly they're selling so that means the prices are justified\", but if you point out low demand and them cutting back stock to keep prices high, people just find another nonsense argument to push.\n\nIt's like way too many people are trying to contort themselves into pretzels to justify these crap prices.\n\nAnd then they're like \"well ackshully its just out of your budget\", YEAH NO CRAP! The current prices are insane, and the lowest RDNA 2 discounted cards are the only ones that remotely approach what i consider a fair pricing. \n\nSeriously, it wasn't long ago when the top end GPU was like $500. Then suddenly it was $700. And then it was $1000. And then $1200. And then $1600. \n\nIt's insane. \n\nHeck, I remember in the late 2000s you could get like a 9800 GTX for like $250 or something. \n\nI remember my first GPU being a $80 3650 and my first \"REAL\" GPU being a 5850 for like $300 or something.\n\nAnd that was like the fourth strongest single card on the market at the time, only below the 5870, 470, and 480. \n\nI mean I remember when the market had like several tiers of products in the $100-200 price range alone.

That would mean they are pushing the frequency target for the 7700 way higher than the 7800, which is the opposite that usually happens on cut down cards. Often they are also sold as lower chips because they can't hit frequency targets.\n\nThe 260w lines up more with the 7900 GRE,  and 245W with a full 60 cu 7800 with a N32 die pushed to it's limit.

Its existence is making the 3060,3070,3080,7600,7700,7800 and even 4070 kind of redundant unless you care for RT performance. Current amd gpu gen is looking so pointless, at these prices, unless you are going for a 7900xt or 7900xtx.

AMD no longer has a **90 competitor, yet they've reintroduced the XTX SKU for some reason. RX 7000 GPUs have all the downsides of being MCM products with none of the benefits. They don't even have a dual GCD product to show for it. I really hope it pays off, because this generation seems like a flop architecturally.",

      "Makes me love my 6800xt all the more. Can't wait for FSR3!",
      "Rasterization performance will be similar between the two cards. Though I imagine the the 7800 XT will pull ahead in ray tracing. Biggest wild card is if cache makes much of a difference as the 7800 XT only has 64mb vs the 128mb in the 6800 XT.",
      "The only reason I’ll make my next upgrade is if ray tracing is both impressive and achievable with a mid range gpu. Until then, I’m just chilling.",
      "7900 XT is the first step up, barely. Literally only option I would consider is 7900 XTX but its freaking 1200€.",
      "I think there isn't much reason to upgrade until the next generation of consoles are out (I reckon \\~4 years from now). If you have a card that is on par with the current-gen consoles, then it should easily play games for as long as this gen lasts.  \n\n\nThe watershed moment in gaming in terms of specs and requirements is the launch of new consoles. Every GPU launched in between is just a stepping stone.",
      "As usual it depends on the specific game but overall the 7900xt is much faster. 27% in God of War, 40% in Cyberpunk, 30% in AC Valhalla, 35% in RDR2. Also 26% higher in Port Royale and 28% higher in Speedway.",
      "It is already confirmed by AMD, it can be used from RX590 onwards",
      "I'm so glad I got a 6800xt half a year ago tbh",
      "Yes, but the feature that reduces latency is exclusive to RDNA3, the plus version. Also, they recommend 60 fps as a baseline.\n\nOverall, this is still better than nothing, hopefully it will infuse some life into old gen cards.",
      "It's a slight regression, but not as a big regression as what happened with Nvidia and their total restacking of the 4000 series.\n\nI mean this 7800xt could have been the 7700xt, or simply a 7800 without the XT.\n\nNvidia went as far as upgrading a 3050 to a 4060 Ti..",
      "Specs are the same as the RX 6800 but it's labeled as an XT. It *might* have performance parity with the 6800XT but I don't expect it to perform any better, if at all, based on the 7900 GRE. Seems like the larger lower level caches help alleviate the need for more Infinity Cache. 128MB Infinity Cache on the RX 6800 is overkill as you'll never clock high enough (2.6 Ghz max) to introduce notable bandwidth bottlenecks in most titles.",
      "If you want raytracing in the mid range go buy an Nvidia card. Waiting for AMD to catch up is just going to leave you disappointed.\n\n3080tis and 3090s are like $500/600 used, that will get you the RT perf of a 7900XTX, and you’ll get DLSS to assist with running the heavier RT games.",

But you just *know* AMD are going to try for 600-650",
      "I mean we already had an upper bound with the 7900xt's performance, what could people have reasonably expected? Anything genuinely good? no way. All those rumors about some purported hardware defect that's fixed in navi 22 were clearly hogwash in the first place.",
      "Unlikely 600.\nRTX 4070 (non Ti) had a $599.99 MSRP on release and I'm pretty sure they'll try to price it less.",
      "The problem are the powerspikes, not the average load.",
      "> Anything genuinely good?\n\nBefore rumors speculating on the disappointing performance of the 7700 and 7800 started to leak out, I had been hoping for a 16 GB 7800 XT = 6950 XT with lower power consumption and a 16 GB 7700 XT = 6800 XT with lower power consumption on the level of the 4070 allowing for some short cards.",
      "6950 XT has some disadvantages, namely power and size.\n\nYou're gonna need an 850W+ PSU for one, and many people buying a 500-600 dollar GPU won't have one.",

      "Yet the 6950 XT is still in widespread stock everywhere and is markedly better than the 4070 and I suspect at the best-case scenario price of €530 they're near breakeven.",
      "Without watching the leak i can tell you also my \"leak\" or my guess. It would be same as from rx 6700xt to rx 6750xt improvement (for 7700 over 6750). This AMD gen is failure. The only way they \"win\" is more vram lower prices.",
      "Wouldn't expect a 7700xt to have 4070 power use when nothing else in the stack has been that efficient",
      "Unfortunately, it is not. It is more like 4-5%.\n\nHave you seen the 7600 reviews? See how it compares against the 6650XT, both cards feature 32 CUs, one is RDNA2 and the other is RDNA3. This is the best CU to CU comparison and the difference is 4% (source: [techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-7600/32.html)).",

      "It's hard to say exactly how the 7700 and 7800 will compare to the 6700 XT and 6800 XT based on what was leaked, but as anticipated it does not look very encouraging.  If the 7800 has the same performance as a 6800 XT, it might be difficult to choose a 7800 over a 4070 unless the 7800 is at least $100 less.",
      "The 4090 jump isn't that much smaller than the 1080Ti jump. The 4090 is like 70% faster than the 3090 at 4K.",

And it features 80 CU. Unfortunately there is no chance the 7800 with just 60 CU will come close to the 6950XT.",
      "Why would you even consider upgrading after just one generation",
      "I had higher expectations as well, but after learning that CU per CU, there has been almost no generational improvement, it became clear that the 60 CU RX 7800 (XT) wasn't going to be much faster than the 6800 non-XT.",
      "Except many can't, because the power spikes on some cards went well beyond anything reasonable. There was, and still is, a lot of back and forth between the gpu and psu makers over this.\n\n\nEdit: there was even an update to the atx standard over this.",
      "Have you seen GPU releases the past 6 months? that defines this entire gen.",
      ">Meh, people also said AMD would price 32CU N33 at 350 dollars, yet it ended up at 270 and on sale for cheaper than that and/or bundled with a game.\n\nBecause people thought it would be more competitive? Once we knew that 32CU N33 is such disaster - people expected 249$ or less"

AMD is loosing GPU marketshare not gaining. 9 out of 10 people I ask or talk to uses Nvidia as well. We ship like 80/20 in Nvidias favor if not more (Enterprise/AI is more like 90-95/10-5 really.\n\nI hope RDNA4 can turn things around for AMD.\n\nAnd no I am not a fanboy. I just want comptetition again but if you think AMDs sells just as many GPUs as Nvidia - or even outsells them - you need to wake up from that dream.\n\nI think many AMD users just buys from Mindfactory. They are very AMD and always released their CPU/GPU sales with the public. If you look at [Caseking.de](https://Caseking.de), one of the biggest German retailers, and check their GPU popularity (most sold) it does not reflect Mindfactory at all either.",
      "This isn’t indicative of the rest of the world. Germany has more of a Radeon culture than the rest of the world because ATI/AMD have/had a bunch of major offices there iirc.\n\nI do find it interesting they’re still going for Radeon after the major increase in energy prices though. I’d have thought they’d go for either a 4060ti or a 4070 because of how much more energy efficient they are. The 4060ti in particular just sips power, I wish an AIB would come out with a half height or single slot version already."

      "I don't think they were complaining. \n\nIt's well known in the industry that Nvidia withholds details about their power limits from manufacturers until the last minute, and in the meantime the AIB's are stuck designing coolers for the absolute maximum TDP they think a generation can ever reasonably expect to hit. That's why the 4080s and 4090s were pretty much universally overbuilt, everyone built them to be able to reasonably dissipate the heat from a 600w load. \n\nRealistically, the 30-series coolers would have been adequate for the 40 series. \n\nThe size bloat is Nvidia's fault. They determined power limits too late in the development cycle, even their own FE cooler is overkill for what these GPUs can be expected to do.\n\nNone of this is a slam on any of the AIB's or even Nvidia, it's just the way it is, and it bloated both size and production costs. We would hope that Nvidia would learn from this and finalize their engineering earlier in the development but the 4090 was an unprecedented success and all their efforts are going into AI now so we consumers will just get what we get going forward.",

      "Should be comparing the 7900 GRE for $550, most people forget it exists lol",
      "If you don't care about upscaling, yeah. I love the 7800xt and if DLSS isn't a factor for you it blows the 4070 super out of the water in value but it needs to be mentioned.",
      "The 6800/6800XT late adopters were the real winners if you have to make a fuss about a $480 7800XT years later.",
      "It depends, to be fair. If it's a cheap 2 vent card, then the heat and noise will destroy any positives. I know that.\n\n\n7900 gre has pretty cool stuff with not much price that is very efficient. And that makes them more attractive.\n\n\nRT stuff isn't a clear winner here, btw. 12gb hurts 4070s a lot, since you have to sacrifice something to get a decent performance. \n\n\nIn short. The only clear advantage is production in CUDA specific apps (there are lots of them though). If that's important - 4070s is better. Everything else is not worth the premium here",
      "> So even if I believe you (I dont)\n\nNobody cares, you literally have a nonexistent CPU in your flair, touch grass",
      "That one compares less favorably. The 4070 Super is clearly the better buy there IMO. [Deadheat in aggregate gaming](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/sapphire-radeon-rx-7900-gre-pulse/32.html), 4070S retains its clear RT/compute/feature advantage while drawing 40-60w less at just $40-50 more.",

      "The 4070S will shortly become the new 3070. Limited by its VRAM. There are currently plenty of games that use over 12Gb at 1440P. Give it another year or two and people will be saying 12GB isn’t enough for 1440P.",
      "my whole household runs AMD (Vega 56, RX 5700XT, RX 6700, plus a few laptop APUs and my Steam deck) and there are no issues or complaints.\n\nThe only thing that I will give you is cutting edge architectures can have some bugs, but that's normal for early adopters and not exclusive to AMD.",
      "Hows your 9800x3d running? xD",

    "comments": [
      "I hope retailer won't try to advertise these potential overclocking performance and price them higher.\n\nOverclocking is always a lottery, just because this gpu have more than usual potential upside, doesn't mean it is a guaranteed result, you could have bought one and a mere 50hz will push it over the edge.",
      "I fear people will OC their card to be unstable then continue to blame bad drivers when infact it's user error flamed by inflated expectations.",
      "Not necessarily. 10fps from 10 to 20 is double (~~200%~~ 100% increase). 10 fps from 50 to 60 is a 20% increase. Using fps as a metric for performance improvement is terrible. Edit: corrected a snafu",
      "The GDDR6 ICs on 7900 GRE cards are rated for 20Gbps, regardless if provided by Samsung or SKHynix.",
      "I'm not sure I like this kind of messaging. Memory overclocking is much trickier to get right and the chips on the card are rated for 18gbps, not 20 like with the other 7900 cards. the fact that they managed to get it to around 20gbps should not be taken for granted.\n\n\n\nI feel like a good amount of people are going to try and replicate other people's results and when those fail at some point, blame the card or the drivers. \n\n\nWe probably see that happening already with so many recommending undervolting the cards expecting to replicate others' results without first realizing that just because the value sets and it doesn't crash immediately, you won't get some sort of issue later on. \n\n\nRunning a card out of spec can have many different ways to fail, you could see more issues with frame pacing, you could see driver resets, you could see texture or polygon flicker, you could see artifacts, sudden crashes to the desktop without an error message and all of them could be random at a random time. It doesn't even need to be at load to manifest itself. \n\n\nPeople used to be way more aware of the consequences of overclocking and undervolting. I don't know if it's just me getting older and crankier or if it is actually an issue.",
      "A cool feature Adrenaline comes with is that 1 click overclock button. You just go intro adrenalin, find the gpu and click overclock, and it sets by itself. This gpu was already good enough, you get 10% on average more performance for 10% more money, than the 7800xt. Now.. if you are able to overclock it and get let's say 15% not 10%, it's even better value, let alone 20%. IDK how to translate +10 fps into % performance, but i guess it's somewhere between 0% and 10%? Anyway, if it's true, this is a good value gpu right now.",
      "Have a Sapphire Pulse model. Techpowerup says that it has hynix VRAM than can go up to 2500MHz (20 Gbps), sadly anything above 2400MHz on \"fast timing\" almost instantly crashes either the driver or PC itself. The GPU itself can haull ass at 2830 ish MHz sustained at 0.95V and 280W TBP. Stays cool and quiet at 71°C",
      "Interesting conclusion. I checked my local microcenter and they have these for $550, and new 7900 XT for $719 to $749, however, you can get a refurbed one w/ warranty for $650. So for $100 more, you're getting better performance and 4 GB of ram.",
      "yes, that's why i said i don't know how to translate into % performance, but also i didn't watch the video, maybe he translates it. Overall a good card for the price, now it's further away from the 7800xt and closer to 7900xt in performance, which is nice.",
      "Sadly, all GPUs locally sold get priced according to benchmarks. If a 4080 does better than a 4090, the 4080 gets a price bump.\n\nEssentially, bang for buck has disappeared completely. \n\nYou either manage to get a promotion code or some kind of sale, or you are fucked paying benchmark prices and not MSRP",

      "I think Steve was rather unclear in the video. He did say the memory was rated at 18.5. \n\nBut at least for Samsung they've already discontinued their slower GDDR6 and 20/24Gbps is the only stuff available now.\n\nSamsung 18Gbps SKU marked as discontinued: https://semiconductor.samsung.com/dram/gddr/gddr6/k4zaf325bm-hc18/",
      "I had something similar with my Powercolor Hellhound 7900 GRE. Fast timing limited the memory OC to 2375MHz, but I can do 2625MHz with default timings.\n\nThis is very different from my experience with the 7900 XTX. That card only lost ~50MHz of max memory clock by enabling fast timings.\n\nTry with default timings and see if that helps. The fast timing option is only worth using if the clockspeed hit is small. Small being ~50-100MHz.",
      "If I recall you can't really have both Fast Timings **and** SAM working well together at the same time. It's too unstable.\n\nI think it was : if you really want to use Fast Timings you should de-activate Above-4G decoding first (therefore goodbye SAM)\n\nBut it seems SAM is more beneficial to have, so just forget about Fast Timings and when you go overclock your VRAM, do it with the default timings as u/jedi95 recommends.\n\nThis way you should be able to push that VRAM overclock enjoying greater stablility.\n\nSource : a random UV+OC video guide on YT, but I can't find the link anymore, sorry lol. \\^\\^",

      "yep, thank you kind stranger. Let's just say hardware unboxed uses the 7800x3d on all resolutions for testing, and the 10% fps is the average, from which 4k resolution massively cuts it down i suppose? In that case this could mean a lot more % fps in 1440p.. don't mind me i'll just watch the video tonight and make some sense out of it lmao",

I mainly play MW2 and wanted to upgrade the whole system for the new COD this year. This card has tackled every graphical setting I could try while maintaining 200+ FPS. (1080p) CAM software doesn’t show GPU stats anymore but with the dual bios that’s not necessary anyway. Stress tests all maxed out at 65 degrees on silent bios. Noise was fairly loud on the performance bios preset and adrenalin fan tuning doesn’t seem to make a difference so I went with the silent bios preset, haven’t had any issues so far. Exactly what I was looking for and I only imagine performance improves from here with FSR 3 and the advance of RDNA 3 drivers. Have high hopes for this card!!

AMD liked to tout that they didn't raise prices between generations, but they pushed their product names up a tier and skipped a 6900 XT successor.\n\nIt's why I hate AMD's pricing and naming this generation. On value, AMD loses at every tier. In value, RX 7000 loses to RX 6000 at every tier, since 7000 uses the price and name of a higher tier than it should.",
      "Yeah, that's how generational improvement used to work. You got more at a faster pace than before. You'd expect the 6800 XT's successor to be a higher-powered card for the same money. Instead, it's a similar-powered card for less money.\n\nEven then, it's generous to consider. It's around the same price the 6800 XT is selling for now. Where we'd expect a new GPU roughly a year after launch, the 7800 XT is launching almost 3 years after the 6800 XT. So, it's on-par with a 3-year-old card that's been on sale for about the same price as the 7800 XT.",

They check in every 3-5 years, look at the numbers on the box, then make a choice.\n\nThis lets AMD slide their cards' branding up a tier. People will see \"$1,000 7900 XTX vs. $1,600 4090\" and not realize they're buying a 4080 competitor. They'll see a 7800 XT and not realize it's a 4070 competitor that's not much better than the 6800 XT. They won't realize they're buying a 7700 XT with a different name.",
      "**They don't!** And for the most part, AMD have had naming conventions that were wildly different from Nvidia's. There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut AMD ***chose*** to align their product numbers, pricing, and performance (for the most part) to Nvidia's for both the RX 5000 and 6000 series. The problem is that AMD *mostly* did the same for the RX 7000 series, but completely threw it in the bin at the high end. It's a way for AMD to pull the wool over anyone who doesn't pay enough attention. Why else would AMD announce a SKU above the 7900 XT in a generation where they don't hold the lead?\n\nIt's just a matter of setting a precedent then going against it arbitrarily.

      "From what little I have heard of RDNA4, it is going to look very alien compared to even RDNA3.\n\nCUs appear to be larger individually based on die size leaks. N48 is \\~30% larger than the N31 GCD for 67% the CUs, and while yeah, GDDR6X PHYs are large, they aren't that big.\n\nComparing to N32, which has the same bus size and only 4 fewer CUs, its GCD is about half the size rumored of N48. N48 is similar in size to GB203, likely a touch larger, so 5080-like silicon costs given both are 4nm.\n\nRDNA2 to RDNA3 by comparison isn't a large jump in the actual CU design from what I can tell after probing around on my 7900XTX and 6700 10GB cards, or my 780M and 680M machines. Most of the changes appear to be in dual-issue support, WMMA support, and some little RT tweaks. Caches also look like they got some changes to handle the extra interconnect delays maybe. RDNA3 looks like RDNA2 on steroids from my perspective, while RDNA4 looks like it may be more like a RDNA1-2 style shift.\n\nIIRC FSR4 relies on FP8, which RDNA3 does not natively do, or at least does not do well. If RDNA4 has dedicated high-throughput low-precision hardware, such as a big block of FP8 hardware in each CU or WGP, then that gets you both die size increases and functionally exclusive FSR4 functionality. Of course brute-force compute is also an option. Maybe there is some threshold amount of BF16 grunt that RDNA3 can put up for at least the halo cards to be technically compatible, (7900 family being a nice cutoff) but maybe not.",

That I might as well spend on an otherwise over priced NVIDIA card and pick up better RT.\n\n\nIf AMD would fix this I'd be dropping coin on a 7900xt or very very seriously considering a 7900xtx.\n\n\nPeople deserve to know about this. \nLots of us are using a spare old monitor for a second display now.",

At that price range if you're just playing games, you're arguably wasting money on a card like the 4090 because it exists to do more than game.\n\n^(EDIT: Although for 4K enthusiast, it is a compelling offer, but the price coupled with Display Port 1.4 support does hurt new 2023 4K monitor support..

You have to ask yourself is Nvidia REALLY worth the extra premium on top?\n\nThis generation will be a defining moment for this community.. If compelling value can move the community to make different purchasing decisions, we will see a better PC market because of it.\n\nI'm still expecting 99% of people to just grab  Nvidia like they've always done since i've been following PC Gaming since the 2011-2012.",

Sure the 4090 is an absolute behemoth of a card but it's just too frigging massive and power hungry. The pricing is exploitative at best and the 4080 12gb was an absolute farce.\n\nThe plan right now is, wait for the zen 4 3d cache cpus in apr/may 23, pull the trigger on a full amd rig and give the middle finger to nvidia. Fingers crossed they get burned financially and do better next time.",

If you compare 7800XT with 7900XTX thats 60% more CU but results only in 44% higher performance. 7900XT has 40% more CU and 28% more performance. The sweetspot always seems to be around 64 CU (Scaling from 7700XT to 7800XT is way more linear).\n\nAlso RDNA3 used Chiplets while RDNA4 is monolithic. Performance might be 5-10% shy of an XTX. It comes down to architectural changes and if the chip is not memory starved.",

Something like adding more register space and extending the types of instructions the second set can perform to allow for single-cycle Wave64 execution more often.\n\nHaving less CUs also means having less scheduling overhead btw. I believe one of the reasons the command processor in flagship RDNA3 clocked higher than the shaders was because of such overhead.\n\nAnyways, the rumored 390mm² seem considerably large for a die with just 64CUs and a 256bit memory interface. Something in that chip is needing tons of space and I don't think it's the fixed-function units or shaders (although the latter are probably less dense than usual to allow for higher clock speeds).\n\nI can't wait to see the architecture reveal and test results from reviewers - I love seeing how these technical aspects affect performance.",

    "comments": [
      "No. This is right. This is what AMD claimed.\n\nWe can't tell how true the numbers are until we get to benchmark it ourselves, though. But it looks great.",
      "Use the Techspot / Hub chart instead. TPU tested with a 5800X which did cause some slight CPU bottlenecking at 4K with the 4090.\n\nTechspot had the 4090 scoring 144fps in the 4k 13 game average and the 6900XT scoring 77 fps. The 54% perf/watt claim was for a 7900XTX at 300W (sneaky bastards) so that gets us to 119fps @ 300W. The extra bit of wattage will allow higher clocks but I expect that causes the perf/watt to drop off (otherwise AMD would have just compared stock vs stock like in prior launches) so lets say that extra 18% power only increases performance by 10% (might be generous but I don't know). That gets us to 130 fps in Techspot charts. Their 6950XT scored 85 fps in those charts and 1.54x that is 131fps so it is close IMO.\n\nGiven that that would make the 4090 about 10% faster than the 7900XTX in raster.\n\nThe 4080 16GB in the NV slides was about 20% ahead (using fantastic eyeball maths!) of the 3090Ti. That card scored 91fps in the techspot chart so that puts the 4080 16GB at around 110 fps.\n\nSo stack will probably look as follows for raster\n\n* 4090        144 fps ($1,600)\n* 7900XTX  131 fps ($999)\n* 7900XT    115 fps ($899)\n* 4080 16   110 fps ($1,200)\n* 4080 12   90 fps ($900) - or whatever it renamed to\n\nFor RT it might be more like (I did raster * 0.65 for NV and raster * 0.5 for AMD here)\n\n* 4090       94 fps ($1,600) 66 fps with new scaling\n* 4080 16   72 fps ($1,200) 51 fps with new scaling\n* 7900XTX  65 fps ($999) 41 fps with new scaling\n* 4080 12   59 fps ($899) 41 fps with new scaling\n* 7900XT    55 fps ($899) 37 fps with new scaling\n\nSo if you want RT performance then 4080 16 is not terrible, about 10% or so more performance for 20% more money. If you want raster then 7900XTX or XT are both good. If you want both you spend the $$ and go for a 4090.\n\nEDIT. I went through and checked the RT scaling at 4K in the games techspot tested. 4090 came out at 0.46x and 6950XT came out at 0.31x. Assuming the 4080 and 7900XTX are similar to those numbers I have updated the numbers to reflect that. It pans out that perf/$ is looking to be about the same for RT performance between NV and AMD but AMD will hold the advantage in raster which might offset the features NV have for some people, time will tell.",

Few price points were better, but none were actually *great*, most of the time it was NVidia raster for 50-100$ less and with worse featureset.\n\n7900XTX had a short benefit of actually being 200$ less than 4080.

Not that any of the other RDNA 3 cards have fared any better, though...\n\nFor reference, the 4080 Super has a higher usage rate on the Steam Hardware Survey than the 7900 XT and XTX *combined* despite only debuting in Jan 2024 (as compared to Navi 31's Nov/Dec 2022 launch dates).",

You can argue it's the same situation as Starfield but man, I've always been one of the people that says Starfield looks good for what it is while everyone else is shitting on it but it's certainly not doing anything that pushes graphics technology to help excuse what's going on there.\n\nI personally thought Cyberpunk was going to be the only AAA path tracing outlier using this tech available for a long time but now Alan Wake 2 is around the corner doing the same thing.",
      "It's really not even an nvidia thing as it is specifically a 4090 thing. I don't think anyone denies that the 4090 is amazing it is just wicked expensive. Like we know that card doesn't compare to the 4090 because the 4090 still commands that massive price difference.",
      "I am really curious if Amd is actually going to change directions and follow what Nvidia and Intel are doing in terms of leveraging AI and getting serious about RT.\n\nIt’s really clear with the results of RR that it’s the future.  And it feels like every year AMD falls further behind, not catching up.\n\nWith the newest showcase from Intel, Intel is going to really be bringing the heat very soon.  Things are heating up for AMD rapidly.",

      "The issue with the 4090 for me rn (as I’m in the middle of my build) is exactly that. At roughly $2500CAD it’s ~$1200CAD more than a 7900 XTX, and ~$1000CAD more than a 4080. Like ffs, it’s a good card, but when the next card below it in performance is nearly half the price, how can I justify it?\n\nI’d love to see a 4080ti, I feel like if they released that, it would be right in that sweet spot for me.",
      "It doesn't have AI cores. It has AI \"accelerators\" which just schedule the matrix tasks for the normal shader units in the GPU to compute using WMMA instructions. It's not the same as Tensor cores from Nvidia or the XMX cores from Intel which are dedicated cores specifically for matrix computations. AMD just throws the words AI Accelerators out there and it confuses people. They are not on the same level as Nvidia or Intel at all",

This is really impressive considering AMD approach is more universal and easier to adopt for future games. From a consumer pov, Nvidia approach is emblematic of capitalism corporate culture, they only thrive in monopoly situation.  They are forcing game studio to follow their own hardware black box standard so that they can easily implement anti-consumer strategy every new gen.",

Basically, when they feel that it will have wide adoption by industry.\n\nSecond, they bought xilinx and a big part of that was to make a push in AI and its clear lately that they are serious about AI inference and such when it comes to servers.\n\nHere is the thing, though. The reason they might not compete in this area in the consumer discrete gpu market has less to do with capability and more to do with how much they care to prioritize the market segment in general. They money is clearly going to lie in servers and not consumer discrete GPUs. So my worry is that they are going to effectively bow out. I think it would be extremely stupid to do so because as Nvidia has shown, AI tech advancements in one segment goes hand in hand with advancements in other segments.",

Awesome. Can't wait.",

      ">I hope they don't get serious about ray tracing because it's the most over rated gaming tech we have ever had. \n\nAnother reddit hot take from someone who doesn't know wtf they're talking about.\n\nRay tracing has been the dream of real-time rendering since the first spinning cube was drawn on the screen.  Not that long ago it was delegated to render farms that would take six to eighteen months to create two to four hours of video.  The fact that we're getting anywhere close at 60-100Hz now is goddamned amazing."

That’s one of the biggest reasons for buying that level of card for gaming to begin with: all-out 4K gaming with all the bells and whistles.

It's just a tier ahead of Nvidia at every level for less money down the entire stack.",

This is why Ampere has not, and will not return to MSRP, the new price for a 60 class card is $499.",

      "Worth mentioning, that ray tracing includes black myth wukong, which is completely broken on AMD and is basically bruteforced, so it Heavily bricks the results for ray tracing on AMD cards. It's ~5-6% better average if you exclude it (since it's a huge outlier)",
      "This. Removing the statistical anomaly or highlighting it would be helpful for a more accurate understanding.",
      "I was planning to buy an RTX 5070 but everyone on the internet told me to wait for RX 9000.\n\nI bought a Gigabyte Gaming OC RX 9070 XT for 85 USD more than the cheapest RTX 5070 in my country🙂\n\nThank you people. My RX 9070 XT demolishes the RTX 5070 where it matters. I believe the 5070 only beats it in path tracing and Black Myth Wukong.\n\nEdit : For those wondering here was my options in my terrible country (expensive GPUs, low wages, 3rd world)\n\nRTX 5070 : 85 USD cheaper than the RX 9070 XT\n\nRTX 5070ti : 195 USD more expensive than 9070 XT\n\nI'm very happy with my choice.",
      "Perhaps watch the DF video on Avatar?  It's one of the best implementations of GI and other RT features (bar the path tracing titles).\n\nIt runs well on AMD not because its RT is bad but probably because it favours AMD in raster and so when Heavy RT settings are used AMD GPU's have a bit more cushion for extra performance drop.",
      "Cant buy either for sane price in Europe",
      "Worth mentioning that Black myth wukong uses a specific Nvidia fork of unreal engine. Not a conspiracy to assume that Nvidia cards have primary focus on that engine.",
      "He's talking about Black Myth Wukong results being an outlier due to raytracing in that game being broken for AMD. Not the existence of raytracing games being an outlier.",
      "TLDR, just look at the average row for each set. It's normalized to a 5070, so if the average line for a card is 110%, that means it's 10% faster than a 5070.",
      "Test was done at very high RT. The usual usage of it, not PT level. For BMW and Alan wake it's PT, actually, that is why it is borked. In Alan wake both vendors die anyway, so having 20 fps on AMD or 25 on 5070 - who cares. Cyberpunk RT works great on both cards and that's what will be in future games.\n\nBMW on the other hand, is completely broken on AMD. Like, it's a sabotage at this point.",
      "No, but the RX 9070 XT beats the rtx 5070 (12GB) even in Ray Tracing😂 Its path tracing where it falls flat on its face, but that's a super duper tiny Sacrifice I am willing to make. \n\nThe RX 9070 XT beats the RTX 5070 in Cyberpunk at 1440p Ray Tracing Ultra preset and basically anything that isn't path tracing I believe (besides Black Myth RT)\n\nI got significantly faster raster  , a little bit faster RT and 16GB VRAM for only 85 USD more. The RTX 5070ti (16GB)  is almost 200 USD more expensive than the RX 9070 XT I bought\n\nI love this card. I just finished undervolting the card. I am getting 230w avg power usage and -3.5% perf decrease",
      "This is many number, and I many stupid…\n\nIs there a TLDR?",
      "Games that rely on RT only like Indiana Jones and Metro Exodus work well on AMD cards so IDK what that guy is talking about. Wukong just runs badly on AMD.",
      "No, the game specifically is an outlier. Cyberpunk with path tracing on all other AMD cards before this performed similarly with the 7900xtx falling behind even the 3060 Ti, but performance is much better with the 9070 and 9070XT. The 9070 XT performs on par with a 4070 in path tracing in Cyberpunk now and heavy RT results across the board are miles better than last generation... But Wukong still performs like shit.\n\n5070 is 15-20% faster in Cyberpunk PT and 73% faster in Black Myth Wukong for some reason.",
      "Same situation in Australia. These companies only care about the American market.",
      "nice",
      "It's a huge outlier and statistics doesn't work that way.\n\n\nIf you keep the broken crap - the difference is 20%. If you ignore that one single crap - it's 10% or so. And that might be a very important thing for buying decision.\n\n\nSo yes, it is important to mention the outlier, so people can see that a make their decision correctly. Because in other RT games AMD is very competitive, like in cyberpunk or avatar or star wars.",
      "BM:W catching strays for no reason.",
      "Also don't forget access to FSR4 when choosing between 9000 and 7000 cards. It's apparently a night and day difference",
      "GNexus review kept BM:W out of the main averaging and still reported the NVIDIA as better in RT. But said 9070 XT was a good buy for MSRP.",
      "how do you come to that conclusion? the 9070 is faster, the 9070xt is faster than the 4070 super.\n\nIts faster than the super and the same price (or 9070 is less).\n\nVery bad TLDR"

I can't believe people were saying 90-95% of the 4090 at a much lower price before,\n\nAMDS marketing was definitely misleading now looking at the average uplift and the conclusion. people were expecting 50-70 percent more performance than the 6950XT but AMD lied out their ass.\n\nwith the average performance jump being 35% with many games below even that. They've definitely pumped their numbers before with every single GPU launch press but this is by far the worst one yet. it led to people having way too high expectations for this GPU, I guessed the average would be below 50% because of the small amount of games tested and cherry-picking and lack of 4090 comparisons but dang\n\n&#x200B;\n\none last edit: this also shows that time spy extreme is really accurate at predicting performance. that leak showed the 4080 and 7900xtx dead locked which is exactly what happens in real world games",

Always loved AMD and despise Nvidia but that’s the truth. Should’ve been $799 for xtx, $649 for XT or something like that, would hurt rdna2 sales ofcourse but all nvidia has to do is drop 4080 a couple hundred dollars or Mayb not even that and it would seriously mess with the sales again",

Radeons are primarily gaming cards, meanwhile Nvidia has a pretty strong foothold in many industries and especially 3090/4090 are very attractive pieces to add to workstation by any 3D generalist. Although the golden choice for that were 3090 nonTi due to being able to pool memory via NVLINK for a whooping 48GB VRAM.",

      "While RDNA has the capability, dethroning CUDA is going to be a long and arduous process.

From his own articles rasterization performance:\n\n>We'll start with the 4K results since that's the most demanding scenario, and CPU bottlenecks can come into play at lower resolutions. \nRTX 3090 takes a modest 8% lead, though the devil’s in the details. Of the 13 games, ten have the 3090 in front, leading by anywhere from 2% (Far Cry 5) to 25% (Strange Brigade). Three games (Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Borderlands 3, and Forza Horizon 4) end up favoring AMD, with Valhalla looking suspect at lower resolutions. Drop to 1440p, and the RTX 3090's lead shrinks to just 1%, effectively tied. \nThe RX 6900 XT now leads in six of the games, though several are basically tied. Valhalla meanwhile jumps to a 30% lead, and as an AMD-promoted game, that's an obvious concern. On the other hand, the 3090's biggest lead comes in Strange Brigade, which is also an AMD-promoted game. Finally, at 1080p, the 6900 XT takes the overall lead by 4%, still leading in half of the games but with very large margins in Valhalla and Horizon Zero Dawn.\n\nTL;DR the 3090 only really beats the 6900XT consistently at ray tracing, which everyone already knew.",

Or like the 4500, which is likely just a batch of leftover Zen 2 chiplets that had cache defects.\n\nThe 7900XT is both an attempt to recoup money on bad stock, as well as acting serving as the [\"decoy\"](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-medium-size-tricks-you-2014-5) to get you to either help AMD move more 7900XTX's (\"it's only $100-200 more!\") or clear old stock (\"the 6950XT is $200-300 less!\").",

Maybe a 7800 as well, but they'd have to sacrifice silicon to do that.  Not likely to be enough salvaged dies to do it normally.\n\nStill, my biggest concern is pricing.  The fact that old RDNA 2 stock is selling for as much as it is doesn't bode well.  Unless they simply plan to drop prices on those substantially after the announcement to keep it moving.  That's the only way to have the new RDNA 3 cards have sane prices.

And yea, they could probably drop prices once RDNA3 is showcased.\n\nGuess we'll see in a couple weeks. I fully plan on buying a 7800xt or 7900xt...but I won't reward stupid pricing. I got the 6800xt  for MSRP because it was an *extremely* fair price for the performance you got from an 8 series. I'm hoping AMD can continue that. Otherwise I will pass."

I estimated that thermal expansion and the pads were causing the core to have less ideal contact, and it appears that was the case.\n* Replaced thermal putty with ptm 7958-sp. This was a paste I applied to the core, let cure for a few hours, and then reassembled the GPU.\n\nEven for this run, the hotspot was still in the 90s, but that's 550w of power being cooled on air (Heck, hwinfo reported like a 670w \"GPU Power Maximum\" at one point, holy shit, but I dunno if to believe that)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 430w power limit I'm still sitting like 62/82.

My raster benchmark vs the best 4090 with my CPU is 82% of performance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 4090 is the undisputed king. I almost bought a 4090, but just didn't feel comfortable spending that much on a GPU, so I decided to give the 7900 xtx a try (as I was exclusively on Nvidia GPUs from 2007-2022.

Maybe it's stacked chips, maybe it's a Ray Tracing Die (RTD) alongside the MCD and GCD, or atop one or the other.

      "AI is sorta weird.\n\nAn average consumer can't really make money off that. You can use it with StableDiffusion to make some fun pictures and memes but their monetary value is about $0. At higher grade - like, say, game development - you also don't really need any computer clusters for this, there are no streamlined tools and processes and output you get is kinda garbage. \n\nWhereas professional grade cards require specs way beyond any home class GPU. anyway Want to run GPT-4 locally? Well, a decent language model needs 400GB VRAM. As in - 5x A100 80GB cards for $12000 each.\n\nYou are a Radeon user? Well, screw you then, best you can have is ROCm with 30% increased memory consumption and 50% higher chance of crashing compared to Nvidia.\n\nBoth AMD and Nvidia have already \"secured\" their consumer grade cards from AI training, it's a completely different stock with significantly altered feature set - 20-24GB VRAM sounds like plenty for a consumer but for a datacenter this is woefully insufficient.\n\nPlus you can't really use any sort of AI by just renting an office room and shoving 50 GPU setup in there, a very common scenario in the mining era. Instead you would need to be a billion $ business with top of the line PhD researchers to advance your chosen field of study - be it sound synthesis, image generation, anomalies detect, medicine and whatnot. Barrier of entry to the lucrative part of the market is extremely high making it significantly different from mining.\n\nSo it doesn't explain any sort of rise in GPU pricing. Your usual home class card would never become a capable AI device - you would need major infrastructural changes. Sure, one can argue that you could just build these instead of consumer ones but... demand is also not as huge as you may imagine for now. There's also a severe shortage of skilled workers that can make any use of these which significantly limits growth (and it's probably why for instance you hear about Elon Musk whining that such development should be stopped for 6 months cuz he couldn't secure his piece of the cake yet).",

      ">But buying into it today at this price is just not worth the saving\n\nI would disagree with this assessment but it depends on what you're doing with it. It's generally 4080-4090 levels of performance for 20-50% less money and with more VRAM than anything except a 4090 which is nice for loading large ML models if that's your bag.\n\nThere are other nice to haves as well. DisplayPort 2.1, USB-C so you can use PSVR2 without an adaptor, normal power connectors.\n\n>gimped RT performance \n\nBe honest, how often are you playing a ray tracing game? In the very few games where RT adds anything the 7900XTX performs around [3080](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-benchmark-test-performance-analysis/6.html) to [3090ti ](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/avatar-fop-performance-benchmark/5.html)levels which is hardly 'gimped'.\n\n>the worst upscaling solution on the market\n\nIt supports TAA, TSR, IGTI, XeSS, FSR, and whatever other custom temporal upscalers exist. The only upscaler it doesn't support is NVIDIA's proprietary DLSS. Not that that matters much since FSR 3.1 is [very close in quality and performance](https://www.techspot.com/review/2860-amd-fsr-31-versus-dlss/) and we know AMD is [continuing to invest in FSR](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-plans-for-fsr4-to-be-fully-ai-based-designed-to-improve-quality-and-maximize-power-efficiency).\n\n>I bet you anything in the next two years, if you are targeting around 90fps, 4070 TiS will give you better visuals\n\nAnd I bet you that in two years time the limited 12GB VRAM on the 4070Ti will result in some sub-optimal gameplay experiences. Avatar already hits 12GB in 1080p Ultra, The Last of Us Part 1 hits 13GB at 1080p Ultra.\n\nThe 4070Ti Super with 16GB is much better off but even that's also going to start hitting walls in 2-3 years.\n\nIt's hard to have better visuals when you're running out of VRAM and have to drop settings.",

    "selftext": "\nSo for context I have a 13700k that I bought at the beginning of 2023 and a 7900xtx. Well unfortunately I suffered from the intel stability issue about a half of a year in that caused major instability, performance issues, and other problems that got worse over time. So earlier this year I had to finally RMA the chip as it finally just like gave out even on complete stock settings. So I get the new processor and I can finally use my computer like I wanted without crashing every couple hours and everything seems okay at face value until I start gaming. \n\nNow on not very demanding games such as Skyrim, Pathfinder games, Fallout 4, and the like it was running fine but anything newer than like 2022 was a hit or miss if it ran well on my computer. I was stumped, everyone seemed to having a grand ole time on specs equal and worse than mine. I wasn’t able to get through like 10 minutes without having unexplainable frame drops or hitching and stuttering during gaming. Turns out after a period of not gaming for awhile due to college I find the motherboard I upgraded to (Z790-F gaming WiFi), since presumably I bought it, had a broken PCIE slot which was limiting my card to PCIE x1 4.0 instead of x16 and wouldn’t change no matter the load.\n\nNeedless to say I was not happy after the discovery and my own ignorance. Ended up RMAing the motherboard and rebuilding and holy moly the rig works beautifully for like the first time in over a year. And hot diggity damn the 7900xtx is way faster than I ever thought it’s unreal. I can’t believe put up with that for like a year.\n\nCheck your PCIE speed people, don’t be like me. \n\nTLDR: had to RMA a faulty CPU due to stability and performance issues only for them to remain, find out it’s also the motherboard running at the wrong PCIE link speed cause the slot is broken.",

He had not properly inserted the GPU into the slot... After he fixed that everything ran smoothly.",
      "Definitely something I’ve since downloaded, after my experiences I now have a sorta checklist to go through to troubleshoot now if anything happens similarly lol",
      "this is why we don't do intel",
      "FWIW I’m on a 9800X3D with a 7900XTX as well, but based on the motherboard design and my needs for storage, I have the card only running x8. Games still cruise at max raster settings on all kinds of stuff from CS2 to Satisfactory at well over 100 fps at 4K. The card is an absolute beast, and while I could move cards around to favor GPU slot data rate over storage rate, benchmarks suggest it wouldn’t make much difference going to x16, so I’m leaving it be for now.\n\n(My motherboard is a Gigabyte x870 variant.)",
      "Not me running to check my 7800xt because I sometimes get stuttering in Rocket League",

(first PC I built myself).\n\nI always had a feeling that I was underperforming in some games, but benchmark scores in 3D Mark, Unigine Superposition etc. were normal, so I thought it was all in my head.\n\nThen when a friend with identical specs and settings was getting 100 FPS more than me in CS 2 I was finally convinced something was up. I spent days trying to figure out what the problem was, reinstalling the game, the drivers, Windows, everything. I had given up. Until one day I was looking through my glass panel, and it finally hit me.\n\nWhen I switched to the correct slot, the gains I made in FPS felt as if I upgraded my GPU, like a free Christmas gift to myself.",
      "Honestly AMD software should have a pop-up \"WARNING YOU ARE RUNNING THIS CARD AT X PCI-E IF THIS IS YOUR ATTENT PROCCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK WITH NEGATIVE PREFORMANCE\" and it should not be able to press just skip cause dumb dumb users will just go huh Okei and then still complain but if it keeps popping up they will start asking around.",

Tried another motherboard and it wouldn’t. \n\nSo I attempted to do a RMA which took almost 3 months of arguing and exchanges. They refused to believe me that my CPU could have died. \n\nThey had me show proof of the CPU sitting in the socket of two motherboards (causing me to have to rip my existing computers apart), and then after that they had me, a week later, do it again but this time holding my case number in the photo. Then they wanted all sorts of pictures in the box. \n\nThey tried to tell me that is user error or that my power supply had issues. It was the longest back and forth ever, sometimes of them repeating stuff I’ve already done or sent. They kept trying to close the ticket!\n\nFinally they tried to make me pay shipping! \n\nThe whole process was absurd. I finally got it approved and shipped. Put the new CPU in when I got it after about 4 weeks (lol) and it worked great. \n\nI have never had such an awful experience. For context, I had an issue with an EVGA 3060 Ti that they RMAed no questions asked and I had it shipped with a new one at my door in 4 business days.",

HOWEVER, if you get permission from AMD in advance to attempt the repair yourself then they can be held liable for any unintentional damage you cause.\n\nI have had a couple OEMs accept responsibility when a customer damaged a system when asked to open it up by their tech support.  One incident was so bad we had to replace the motherboard, RAM, battery, bottom cover, and palmrest.  The user didn't shutdown the computer, and wasn't asked to, opened the bottom cover at the request of the OEM tech support, didn't manage to unscrew every screw and pried open the bottom, breaking the bottom cover and cracking the palmrest, he then disconnected the CMOS battery, not the main battery cable, then unscrewed the heatsink from the CPU while the system was hot and running, dropping the screw on the live board and shorting out the entire system, catching the battery cable on fire.\n\nI had to fight the OEM for all of five minutes to accept responsibility.  The tech support guy naturally said that if the end user wasn't comfortable doing it he shouldn't have, and I said tech support can't ask the end user to open their device without accepting the risk that the end user might inadvertently cause another issue.  The tech spoke to their higher level support and immediately accepted my position and sent out every part I requested.  Unfortunately, I wasn't the one that got to fix the system 😞",

      "Lots of misinformation and the usual snide comments here. You can tell when no one has any actual experience with something.\n\nStar Citizen's performance is not as bad as it used to be, nor is it as bad as people jeer about in comments.\n\nI'm on a 6900 XT, run at 1728 or 1800, and get upper 50's FPS on average. It's near enough to 60 that I have Chill enabled for the game because some areas will go above that. If I run at 1440p then the game's performance is generally smooth across the board unless the server is chugging hard.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nRamble for more info, if you're interested:\n\nPresently what matters the most in Star Citizen is the CPU rather than the GPU. Think of it as an MMO in terms of performance behavior rather than a first person shooter and you'll know what the performance is like. Whether someone wants to classify it as an \"MMO\" or not is irrelevant, I'm just talking about performance. In this regard, if you get something like the 5800X3D (or a more recent equivalently performing CPU) then you're going to get significantly higher frame rates.\n\nPatch 3.18, which is currently on a separate additional test server, has the first iteration of the Gen 12 renderer which off-loads some of the CPU work onto the GPU. If someone is currently CPU bound in SC then 3.18 can improve their performance somewhat, though I haven't seen numbers to know exactly how much of an improvement this has been. Basically, they're moving away from the existing aging renderer to Vulkan for improved performance, visuals, and the option to add modern things like HDR, VR, et al.\n\nBut if you don't have access to 3.18 yet or you don't have a better CPU, then there are also numerous INI tweaks that can be done, as is typically the case with PC gaming. Just do a YouTube search for Star Citizen Performance Guide or the like and you'll find them. The one that says 3.17.2 FPS+++ in the thumbnail is my favorite because it doesn't waste too much time with fluff in the video and the description has the necessary info, but the others probably work fine. Follow it and the game doesn't look like poo, though you're obviously trading some visuals for performance, and it will run much better.\n\nWhat you're going to see in the comments are a lot of people who remember when no amount of hardware could push the game beyond 30 FPS. Some will claim this is still the case. Those people have no idea what they're talking about, or have really bad hardware, or refuse to do any INI tweaks because they feel like \"They shouldn't have to do that\". In a PC game. As though this has never been the case in PC gaming. 🙄\n\nPersonally I get my aforementioned FPS without doing the INI tweaks and this is almost entirely because of the CPU.\n\nThere are some very real issues to complain about with SC but performance, if you've been gaming on the PC for any length of time and know how to edit a text file, really isn't one of those issues.",
      "I play everyday past two years idk what people on internet think",
      "Star citizen isn't dead, but it may as well be given the slow motion trainwreck of a development effort so far."

I may try pushing it further later. So far only real test outside Time Spy (which got about 26400, ie beating the reference XTX) was [Cyberpunk ultra settings + medium RT + quality FSR 2.1 which sits at almost 70 fps average at 1440p](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/249112416854474752/1052746875909984286/image.png). This is way outdoing my expectations but reading around sounds like I may have won the silicon lottery.\n\nEdit: Also tried Elden Ring now. It's admittedly 60fps capped, but got it to run that stable with all settings maxed out.\n\nOne snag I've run into - was [trying to get a run of Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK/blob/main/shark/examples/shark_inference/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_amd.md) but it doesn't look like the RDNA3 driver supports MLIR/IREE yet so no dice :( (garbage output in fp16 mode, IREE compiler error in fp32 mode). Sure enough the last MLIR/IREE driver was a month ago and only 5000/6000 cards. Will try with DirectML (which is *much* slower) tomorrow.\n\nEdit2: Did in fact get DirectML Stable Diffusion working [following this guide](https://gist.github.com/averad/256c507baa3dcc9464203dc14610d674),\n\n    12152022-145016 - Model: C:\\Users\\LordAlfredo\\Stable Diffusion\\model\\stable_diffusion_onnx Scheduler: PNDMScheduler\n    12152022-145016 - Inference Steps: 64 Guidance Scale: 10 Width: 512 Height: 512\n    12152022-145131 - Seed: 277436425 - Gen Time: 40.4030237197876s\n\nCaps out at 768x768 generation (at that point I'm at full VRAM usage). Really caps out 640x640 or 704x704 depending on parameters, pushing too hard gets garbage out. This thing is a fp16 compute *beast*, 50 iteration 512x512 image generation finishes in ~30-40 seconds!\n\nEdit 3: Finally hit an OC instability crash in 2 hours of Cyberpunk w/ a second monitor running.

Any movement on the voltage slider for example core clocks shoot up but scores go way down.

      "Exactly because like 95% of people using a console don't even know what hardware is inside, which is fine it's just a more casual demographic. Typically if you tend to care about PC hardware on an enthusiast level you're much more likely to get into PC gaming vs console.\n\nEven at the ultra-enthusiast level where people know AMD is a good option Nvidia dominates. I think when you get to this level of people paying $1000+ for a graphics card the mindset is they want the absolute best they can get which tends to be Nvidia. That's why you see heavily discounted 6900XTs and the like right now because AMD is having a hard time getting enthusiasts to buy them.\n\nObviously they need to have products at the high end of their product stack but I think they need to more aggressively market to the mid and low end markets looking to buy GPUs."

      "this card isn’t worth $1k IMO.",
      "Has anyone ever seen a **$1,000 card with a cooler from that of a $500 card** in previous generations?\n\nForreal, **massive disappointment in AMD**. They clearly developed the 7900 XTX in the same vein as the 6900 while not anticipating the massive jump between Nvidia 3000 and 4000 series. So while the previous X900 segment, the **6900 was close to 3090 with 6950 matching 3090ti, now it can only match the 4080 in raster. And light years away from 4090.**\n\nMeanwhile, everybody knew to expect worse off RT but the gap is 30%-40% worse in RT + only matching 4080 in raster + a barely okay cooler that gets **84C memory temps under load in open air test bench**. $200 doesn't justify this, it needs to be much cheaper and not just a little cheaper, and AIB coolers will fix this but at $60-$100 price jump which makes the value proposition a joke.\n\nThe 7900 XTX offers no real value compared to 4080 when you factor in same raster + RT + crappy barely okay cooler. And buying AIB 7900 XTX (@ $1050-1100) is just insane when you can spend a little more over AIB models to get even better thermals from 4080 Fe (specc'd for 650 watts) and vastly superior RT.\n\nThe 7900 XTX is really more like 7800XT and should be price at $800.\n\nAMD clearly saw their competitor increase their prices and took the opportunity to do the same even though their **product segmentation is vastly inferior, slipping from 3090ti competitor to 4080 competitor**. They saw their chance to increase their prices and they did while claiming to offer value, but if you consider the RT difference and the cooler difference, the value isn't there. It needs to be even more cheaper to offer real value.\n\nThe 4080 FE's insane cooler designed for 650 watt 4090 runs at low rpms even under load, meanwhile the 7900 XTX with Gamer's Nexus testing hits 84C memory temp on a open air test bench.\n\nIf you are spending close to $1100 for AIB RX 7900 XTX then there's no reason for you not to spend $100 more to get 40% better RT from 4080 FE and even better thermals than AIB 7900 XTX as I doubt even $1100 AIB cards will have coolers specc'd for 650 watts.",

      "I'm not buying a 1000$ GPU and not use freaking RT. Fuck AMD and fuck Nvidia.",

      "It is a real thing but only for high-end cards and still won't leave raster in the past until the next gen of consoles, who should be able to do RT much better than the current ones - and they dictate the market, basically.\n\nMost RT games barely have any significant visual impact (implementations like in FarCry 6 do not count), and the ones who do (Cyberpunk-like) need a significant drop in resolution/FPS to achieve it on anything below 4080 - which you may or you may not take - up to a point it's debatable and depends on each individual.\n\nIt's disappointing from a 999$ part, nonetheless, **but the raster performance of just equaling the 4080 is much more disappointing than the RT one** if you ask me.",
      "I've been waiting on this review to pull the trigger on a new card. I'm still on a EVGA 8GB 1070ti, which has performed valiantly over the years. I've been trying to push it into 1440p gaming but it's limping along at this point.\n\nReading the other replies and I feel like I'm missing something. At 1440p/RT/Ultra on the worst title benchmarked (CyberPunk) it ran close to 80fps. And neither 4080 nor 7900xtx can hit the 120fps with these settings so consistent/high 60fps+ seems like the best you can do at the price tier. As a 1440p gamer, that looks good to me. Not to mention it'll trade blows with 4080 on raster going forward. \n\nOthers are saying it's not worth $1000 tag, but at that price what is a better value? Why would I spend extra $200 just for an nvidia brand at this point? I get that $1000 is a large sum of money in the absolute but in the GPU market comparing with what else is available I'm probably still going with this one over the 4080 or the older gen 3090.",

Which directly aligns with my general observations of about 10%. \n\nI cannot offer a direct comparison of my cards because, again, the 4090 is dead due to a well know design flaw in the cards.

    "selftext": "This is a short and sweet post but honestly looking at the reviews for the 4080, I'm hoping the 7900 XT(X) really hits the nail on the head. For some of the numbers, I've watched from reviewers like LTT, GN, and J2C all the 7900 series cards need to just perform at least 1.3x the performance of the 6950XT to equal or outperform the 4080 in everything. 1080 to 4k rez. I do think a 30% uplift is possible be it AMD says they can get up to a 67% bump in performance with recent charts. Time will tell but I think I'm becoming a full AMD boy by next month. (BTW This is all super simple look at numbers and then multiply by 1.3x) Damn, I love competition.\n\nEdit: (12/12) Circling in back to this post since the benchmarks are out. Raster performance looks to be on average compared to the 4080 which is great! Sometimes higher sometimes lower. Obviously RT is hurting bad and I don't see that performance getting a crazy uplift so it seems AMD will always be 1-2 gens behind with RT. All we can hope is the drivers are stable and constantly updated as well. I do believe that Nvidia will drop the 4080 to $999. I cant see a future where they don't so it'll then become a battle between team green or team red. AMD IS STIRING THE POT!",

      "By \"7800xt\" you mean the real 7700xt? Right? Because AMD is doing the same thing Nvidia did with RTX 4080 12GB. Higher price point for the lower tier card so they switch the names around.\n\nRX 7900 XT should have been called RX 7800 XT.",
      "If AMD's official benchmarks are close to reality, which it should be.\n\n7900XT should more or less match 4080.  XTX should be within 10% of 4090.  This is traditional performance only of course.  We will be one full generation behind on ray tracing.  DLSS is better than FSR too.\n\nObviously AMD doesn't want to compare against 4090 directly because XTX loses in every metric except price, but overall it should be a strong alternative.\n\nIf you look at Steam, 3070 and up vs 6700 and up, Nvidia has 10 to 1 lead in hardware survey.  I hope AMD can close the gap to something like 4 to 1 or even 3 to 1, one year from today on 4000 vs 7000.",
      "The issue is that Nvidia has so much mindshare, it might not even matter.  \nI see so many people on discord and other social spaces only looking at the new nvidia cards and complaining about prices without even considering getting an AMD card instead.",
      "Honestly, if the XTX is within 10% of 4090 perf while costing $600 less, that IS a win for AMD.",
      "Nvidia is being greedy and planning for an inevitable 4080 Ti to bridge that performance gap. The gap between the 3080 and 3090 was much smaller, but it also meant that people didnt buy the 3080 Ti.",

      "Provided the 7800xt is similar price to last gen I'll be happy",
      "It's just longtime fans who are still stuck in the Underdog frame of mind. \n\nAMD has been a raw raster *and* price value king for the last two generations, and it resulted in practically no change in their market share. The 3060 alone outsold all of RDNA2, for example. \n\nIt's not enough to just be cheaper and comparably performant at regular raster performance. There's so much more that AMD need to catch up on before casual gamers start taking them seriously. \n\nRT for example. This sub can shit on it all they want, but regardless of whether someone intends to turn on RT or not, they'll still want a GPU that won't shit the bed on the off chance they decide to try it out. And right now, Nvidia is basically double the performance of AMD in that space; I can see why some might go Nvidia despite higher prices because of that.\n\nThink about it; if you have Nvidia card A and AMD card A, and you wanted something cheaper but still RT-performant, you could just go down one tier to Nvidia card B, and *still beat the RT performance of AMD card A while spending less than both Nvidia card A and AMD card A.* All while still having access to stuff like DLSS, NVENC, CUDA etc in the rare off chance you decide to exploit those features.",
      "I'm just saying, RX 6800 XT is the same GPU class as 6900 XT and 6950 XT.\n\nRX 7800 XT will NOT be the same GPU class as 7900 XT and 7900 XTX. It's pretty obvious what has been done here but nobody is raising alarms because it's AMD so they get a pass for something that is literally the same as what Nvidia did to the point where Nvidia had to \"unlaunch\" their 4080 12GB due to backlash.",
      "Everyone acts like their friends and family will rush to buy a 1k GPU on here lol. Even if it’s competitive it won’t matter in the grand scheme of the market. Nvidia and AMD most profitable GPUs are the midrange. There’s over 5xs the amount of 3060 over 3080 and the 3080 was $700. Thinking that a 1k GPU will somehow turn the market is being delusional. These 1k+ cards won’t even break 1% of the market share.",
      "All they want from AMD is to get them to lower Intel and Nvidia prices. At least on the cpu side, AMD are firmly established as a equal quality product after the 5000 series.",
      "It realistically wont be though. It will maybe get there or even match the 4090 in some games, but some others will get demolished. People are doing all kinds of mental gymnastics but the reality is that when you start averaging a large amount of game all with their engines and bottlenecks (cpu or otherwise) the average performance goes down. Even the 4090 is not well represented because the faster you are the more bottlenecked you get.",
      "Same. If the performance uplift from 6700xt to 7700xt is trash then I'll just get a 6800/xt. I'm tired of these normalized prices/upsell tactics.",

If we did actual currency conversion, $600 without VAT would be 535€, add 20% and you get to around 640€. Basically, official European MSRP is already inflated and actual market prices are much higher than even that inflated MSRP. A 9070 XT at 750€ is about the same value for money as a 500€ 7800XT, with actual 7800XT prices starting at 470€. AMDs newest generation is much worse value than their previous gen cards.",
      "Exactly the same boat here. When I saw the MSRP 5070 Ti (described by AMD as a more powerful card) next to $800+ 9070 XT, there was no longer any point in considering the latter."

      "Yeston does what others dont even dare to do.\n\nIts kinda refreshing to see\n\nbut im really curious how a dual slot, two fan design holds up vs the tripple fan, tripple slot models that came to be standard this generation.\n\nSure the 9070 (non XT) has 100W less power and its possible to cool 220W with a dual slot design.\n\nA tripple slot design for 300-360W for the 9070XT is good. Its big but many people value silence and temps a lot. My Pulse roughly reaches 55C core and 78C Hotspot while the memory is cooking at 90C.   \nHow much metal can you shave off a tripple slot design before it gets too loud/annoying or the memory/hotspot temp get too high?  \nI dont know. With 2 8Pins and a boost clock auf 2970Mhz it seems to be a 300W Powerlimit, but maybe its factory undervolted to reach something like 280W?\n\nEither way interesting GPU, but it might not perform as expected in the tight cases that would benefit from a two slot, two fan design",
      "looks pretty sweet actually. Nice and simple.",
      "No waifu?? Oh the betrayal, Yeston!",
      "Powercolor Reaper 9070XT is dual-slot. I have one and of course it's a bit louder with a smaller cooler but it's not a problem at all if you put the card in efficiency/quiet mode. It still uses up to 300W but keeps the fans down at the expense of higher temps and slightly lower clocks. Which is fine by me, I didn't buy it to squeeze every last fps out of it. So, these new cards from Yeston should do well in that regard.\n\nIt also looks like the Reaper is narrower than these new cards from Yeston so the Reaper may be a better choice if you are trying to fit one in a SFF case. And Alphacool just came out with a water block for the Reaper, that might also weigh in on your decision if you ever want to water cool it.",
      "Yo but WhereTF is the anime waifu art?",
      "58 mm is too thick for SFF",
      "The article is somewhat wrong, Yeston has launched the 9000 series cards worldwide. The issue is limited distribution and of course scalpers. Believe me, I was beaten once by scalpers and almost beaten a second time. But I did manage to score my 9070XT on the second try.\n\nThat said I wish they'd made the 9070XT waifu cards two-slot instead of the three-and-a-half slot monstrosity that came out.",
      "No waifu? No deal!",
      "while Yeston is known for their Waifu cards, if you ever go on their site to look at their track record, they will often also have a [very basic and boring model next to their unique models](https://yestonstore.com/collections/rtx-50-series).",

And I can confirm that you don't want to run it at stock settings, just keep it in quiet mode. As for fan RPM, no idea, I haven't checked.",

      "> that came to be standard this generation.\n\nHasn't it been standard since about the RTX 3000 / Radeon 6000 generation? IIRC it really shifted heavily toward bigger cards then.\n\nImo I'd love more smaller cards designs, every GPU targeting something like 55-60C temps is slightly annoying when they can run fine at 75-80C.\n\nBut it's not really a value add for many people to have a small card since no one uses expansion cards anymore, so they just make bigger cards that make them look better in reviews.",
      "Off the top of my head the R9 290X hit 290W TDP with a 2 slot *blower* cooler. It's definitely doable.",
      "maybe im not bad at expressing my point but this card making the case more clearly. the 980 ti is a 601mm chip, a giant chip by any measure. That means you have way more area to transfer thermal load to the heatsink. so the bigger the dye is the easier it is too cool it while using the same power. \n\nMeaning a 600mm 300watt dye will be much easier to cool then a 300mm 300watt dye because it does not have the surface area to transfer the heat as efficiently as the larger dye can",
      "~~YES! This should actually fit in the build I'm trying to do. Now I have to find a way to be able to buy this XT model if it doesn't get sold locally.~~\n\nEdit: Nvm, it looks like only the GRE model is 2-slot 😔",
      "Not what I was expecting from this vendor.  Not bad actually.",
      "VC left out the most important part while writing the article. Is this intentional? YESTON sold the 9070XT GAEA for online pre-order at 4999CNY (=599\\*1.13USD, yes, Chinese VAT) at the same time as the release, and resellers are also maintaining the same price range.

      "$699 USD is the real price. You won't see $599 9070xts again as AMD literally had to give out vouchers to retailers to sell it at $599 on launch day, so the retailers didn't lose money on the sales. It was a fake MSRP. The review videos are all based on this fake value of the 9070xt, which is a W for AMD as those videos still exist glazing how good the card is, though the price isn't the same anymore.",
      "Seems a US problem, many other countries they are available, but still 100-150 over MSRP.",
      "Tried buying a 9070 XT Reaper on launch day for $599. No luck.\n\nI was \"able\" to purchase the powercolor reaper earlier this week on Amazon for $750. Initially, I was stoked. The next day, I came to my senses and cancelled the order. \n\nThey are out of their god damn mind by charging $150-200 over MSRP. \n\nThe next card I purchase will be at MSRP. I dont give two shits if it's an NVIDIA card at this point.",
      "Take this information with a grain of salt.\n\nApparently those are EU prices and they \"averaged\" it.\n\nSome countries in Europe sell it for E1000 while others sell it for E750, hence the average is higher across the board.",
      "Might aswell buy a 5070 Ti then",
      "Because MSRP was a lie, AMD always intend to it be around $700-$750 and only did last minute store rebates for $600 when they saw the price of the 5000 series, it was a limited early adopter fee.\n\nI was there with 4 websites open the second they launched and they got cleaned out by bots in 30 seconds for the $600 and within 5 mins for all of the models.\n\nI intended to do a full upgrade to AM5 system(Mobo, Ram, Cpu) so I wanted a cheaper GPU but after a month of checking the only regular restocks were $800+ 9070xts hell with that nonsense, a 5070ti popped into stock at MSRP so I went Nvidia, I imagine I'm not the only customer AMD lost over not enforcing MSRP.",
      "That should be illegal.",
      "In Germany Msrp is 689€ iirc.\nCheapest card i could find was just about 750€ so 60€ above msrp.\nVat included for prices of course.",
      "$800 is not the standard price. I’m still holding AMD to their word & will only purchase this card @ $599. \n\nIf it happens, great. If I’m unable to find the card at its advertised price….even BETTER. This is not a necessity for me & I’m better off saving my money or giving it NVIDIA instead.",
      "\"Manufacturer suggested retail price\" is purely a marketing number, there's no legal obligation for anyone to sell it at that price. It's annoying though.",
      "Especially funny after all the fake MSRP drama for nvidia.",
      "Let’s say we use your lower end of 750, is that MSRP?",
      "Whose fault is that? I'm in another hobby where the manufacturer caps the price their products can be sold by partners, break that agreement and they can cut you off and stop you selling their products. I find it strange watching Nvidia and AMD allowing their partners/retailers to freely do what they do with their pricing.\n\nI had a look out of curiosity last night at some GPUs to see if prices had settled at all and the cheapest 9070XT I could find is the Sapphire Pulse at £650. I'm not currently looking to upgrade my GPU so it doesn't really affect me, but I try to keep up with the prices none the less for when I do a new build.",
      "The difference is AMD is not providing the end completed product, they supply the GPU, so they cannot control the price the same way. Each board partners product is theirs uniquely.",
      "The Microcenter in Denver has them in stock more often than not lately.  They have 6 models in stock right now.  They still tend to go quick, but it seems like every other day or two they get more in, and they're usually around for a couple of days.  The 5080's have been in stock for a while, and the 5090's even make appearances once or twice a week.  They're all way over MSRP, though.\n\nI'm unsure about Best Buy since I never have a reason to go there, but I think we're on the verge of seeing them in stock more often.  Just don't expect them at MSRP.",
      "Newegg has 9070xt for 5070ti minus $50, you might be right on that one.  Microcenter has it for $150 less.  But for either one, you have a more stable driver experience with AMD.",
      "Considering micro center has the reaper listed for $800 now that $750 wouldn't have been completely terrible if you really needed the upgrade.",
      "Probably just a US thing because here in Canada they've been in stock pretty much everywhere for the past while and not running out, though not MSRP. The cheapest model I can find is $949.99 (\\~$687.33 USD). Most models go are in the low $1000+ mark.",
      "Then the price difference becomes only 13% instead of the 25% @ MSRP that the tech influencers based their “great value” verdict on. Suddenly that value proposition becomes quite different."

The factory limits are for reliability. 7900 XTX doesn't run 3200 average clock, either, but mine has done it for for two years because it can. Same thing applies for the 9070 XT. Throw an Alphacool block onto whichever model has the best VRM, then EVC or shunt it (per buildzoid's trick) and you're in business.\n\n9070 XT(X) is a hero's journey",

    "selftext": "So in the last month I was about to test out the Sapphire Pure 9070 and the Gigabyte Eagle OC Ice 5070. The performance surprised me by Nvidia. As we all know the Rtx 50 series are not receiving that much love due to all the issues we have hear. BUT! I overclocked it (300+ core and +2000 memory) and man it’s almost all the games I play it was performing better than the 9070 overclocked as well…. I have a 9800x3d on a asrock b650 motherboard with 64gb of ddr5 6000mhz quad channel ram. The nvidia card does run a little hotter but temps are reasonable. On the 9070 it was sitting at 50-55c gaming with very high/ultra settings and the 5070 60-65c with the same settings. Both cards are amazing, both cards have its favors in games. For streaming the nvidia card is way better of course, always have been. In conclusion, get either card and you can’t go wrong. Just make sure you don’t spend 200$+ the msrp. Max to spend I would say is 650 on either card. But when prices normalize, if they do, go with the 9070 xt for sure. But that post will be at a later time…. 9070 xt vs 5070 ti :) Hope this helps with your gpu purchase ",
    "comments": [
      "I think the 5070 would be seen as a great card if the 40 series didn’t exist…… the issue wasn’t the cards performance, it was the rise in price and lack of performance uplift compared to its predecessor.",
      "Whichever you get at a lower price tbh. The 9070 performs better on average but not so much that you should choose it over a 5070 if you find the 5070 to be priced consistently lower, which in my area I tend to find them at MSRP quite often",
      "10% is a huge performance uplift that most certainly does not come from a driver and apply to all games across the board. That’s game to game basis at best, and ones that already performed worse",
      "Cyberpunk is less intense on vram than Indiana jones, but you can get both games to use more than 12gb of vram at 1440p in my experience. 9070 falls behind in rt which will hurt it in Indiana jones, but as far as I’m aware the amd cards actually do decent in cp ray tracing this gen.",
      "To be honest I wouldn't listen to a thing you said after you said the mod requires a dual bios, something it doesn't \n\nalso I refer your statement back to you\n\n>   \nHoly crap read you baboon\n\nAs what I said are valid critics on you claiming you are over clocking and pushing both cards... are you really in any country where overclock voids your warranty so will bios flashing... in any country where it doesn't it will not. \n\nSo long story short for the person who actually isn't reading ... it is no more unsafe than overclocking meaning it is worth the same same to do if you can. By not doing it you aren't have a true apples to apples test. This gives the Nvidia an unfair advantage. You should admit that instead of saying, \"AAAAAAAGAIN I WOULDN\"T DO IT.\" because while you may not by ignoring the fact you are actively lying to people through omission that you preformed a fair and balanced test.",
      "Depending on the kind of games one runs, as well as the resolution, the 5070 is often crippled by the insufficient vram. It's not a bad card, but it has limits in one particular aspect and is often held back by poor design. Nvidia has more mature upscaling and other features (fgen, mfg stand out) that use non-insignificant amounts of vram. So naturally, green cards that normally suffer from vram amounts are held back even more.",
      "“Just make sure you don’t spend 200$+ the msrp.” Great advice.",
      "I've had my 5070 for almost 2 months and have no issues with it. On my 1440p 240hz OLED monitor , with DLSS and Frame gen, I hit 224 FPS locked on everything I ever throw at it , with my temps being below 65 C. Smooth ,quiet and beautiful on that OLED",
      "But you are not wrong there. especially the 40 super series",
      "In the most recent driver update the 50 series did get another 10% performance uplift. We just need to wait and see if the reviews revisit the 50 series in the next couple of months.",
      "I didn't run to any. Maybe because I haven't played games like Indian Jones or Cyberpunk because I don't own those games.",
      "5070ti is really a different card than the 5070 and worth it if you find at msrp. Very few 9070xt are going for anywhere near msrp so the pricing is pretty close. The 4070 was also a disappointment for the most part.",
      "I don't play in 4k. You try it and let me know how it goes.",
      "I was playing with my 5070 on my G9 57\"... 7680x2160...only in Warthunder, but I usually run max detail sans RT and 120fps with DLSS on balanced was no issue at all. It was using about 50w more power than my 4090 at the same settings though. VRAM didn't max out either.\n\nWas perfectly playable.\n\nDid some FH5 also at the same res, all set to ultra, again with DLSS and it was perfectly usable.\n\n5070Ti arrives today to play with, let's see how it is. Should hopefully be a good FG card as thats its main purpose for me.",
      "They honestly don’t remember..I read their stupid comments everyday and remind them that a 4080 was $1199 msrp with the same performance as a $750 5070ti",
      "Thx. I want to get the 9070 but the 5070 is consistently much cheaper",
      "Cyberpunk won't run into any VRAM issues even with PT",

Card is the Gigabyte 9070 OC edition.\n\nIs this behavior normal? Is there a way to make it so the fans just stay fired up while gaming through Adrenalin?

They also sometimes had the nitro and the pulse cards, but I really didn't like the aesthetic of the pulse card.

It's a 10% difference in performance (on a good day) for way more power, more heat and wear.. ehh... \n\nAnd the steel legend has one thing none of the other 9070xts have. **RGB Fans**.

Why is Navi48 so much more dense than Blackwell (it's almost equivalent to a node shrink). He basically admits he doesn't know. I will have a guess: the 64mb of cache in both designs are not quite the same. Nvidia uses L2 which is typically higher performing - and to get the L2 transistors to perform higher the 'library/design' won't be as dense. L3 cache is typically a little slower (latency), and hence the transistor design can be a little more aggressive/denser. This doesnt explain the whole difference, but possibly a chunk of it.",

If the gel leaks out after thermal cycling and exposes components to thermal damage, that would be really bad (almost as bad as gigabytes exploding PSUs). But if it is just excessive gel from an OEM deciding that a little too much was safer than a little too little on the manufacturing line, and the cards all work as advertised and don't have an atypical failure rate, then is it really a big deal at all?",
      "Have a gaming oc 9070xt. The card definitely has excessive gel everywhere, but no issues with it. Haven't seen memory or hotspot temps go above 80c.",
      "Same here. Runs at 58 load with OC and 107 % power. Cool customer here.",
      "It's your card man. Based on the comments, what do you think? Unless you have a better alternative for the same price, I would stick to this one, as there's nothing really against that model, that would suggest it's faulty (unlike their RTX). Unfortunately, my order was cancelled due to being out of stock and now the cheapest is for around $780, so i'm holding off for a little longer until I can get one closer to $750, Either this, or i'm considering ASRock Steel Legend / PowerColor Reaper (both XTs).",
      "I had not seen any of those images previously, and some of them certainly do look more like displaced thermal paste than excess squeezed out during manufacturing. So now we just need more data points.",
      "No leaking but I had vram errors running stock on the gigabyte gaming 9070 xt which was fixed by repasting. \n\nLeaking would have been better bc it would mean too much tim applied.",
      "I have had a Gigabyte Aorus 9070 XT Elite for a few weeks now and haven’t noticed anything yet. Will be keeping an eye on it.",
      "Same card for me, also vertically mounted. Nothing put of the ordinaty, but keeping an eye on thd card as well.",
      "I was skeptical at first because it was all based on one user report, but seeing all the extra images and posts that have since come out has convinced me it is sliding out from under chips. Especially because I noticed it is leaving residue behind. The strangest thing to me is how the gel/putty manages to slide out so cleanly despite it stretching out and tearing when removing the heatsink. It kind of sucks because it seems like they were the one AIB actually pumping cards out for both AMD & Nvidia.\n\nHere's a couple pictures. I've seen more, but I'm not gonna spend my time looking:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/7WwSjCK\n\nThe pictures are from these two sources:\n\nhttps://videocardz.com/newz/gigabyte-reputation-melts-alongside-thermal-gel-more-cases-of-rtx-50-gel-spill-issue\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gigabyte/comments/1kkxs1b/5070ti_aorus_master_leaking_thermal_putty/#lightbox",
      "Did it happen right when you got it? If so this is really poor QC by Gigabyte.",
      "Man, mine still has yet to arrive in the mail. Should I just cancel it?",
      "I was experiencing early thermal putty sag in my Gigabyte 9070 XT and I contacted support in the UK. this was their response: https://imgur.com/a/d1jotyu",
      "Nothing with the oc gaming 🥳",
      "No stres needed with the radeon cards from gigabyte. It is a nvidea thing 🤣 those where all the first batches",
      "Still nomad 9070dt running below 50 on GPU and 67 ram didn't notice anything",
      "So there’s a chance it can leak into PCIE slot? Vertically mounted",
      "Same card, not vertically mounted but would you mind sharing temperatures? Mine is around 60 for global, 86 for hotspot and 87 for memory",
      "Lol, what a nothing burger they served you...\n\nAnd in the meantime I've just ordered myself a PowerColor Hellhound 9070xt, despite all the noise I made with my post, haha ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)But to be honest, that bad boy was like $45 more than the Gigabyte 9070 model, and I was also urged a little bit by the impatience of the buyer of my current GPU, so I bit the bullet, hopefully won't regret it!\n\nWish me luck, as i'll be trying to jam that into my MSI Forge 100M, all powered by 750w 80+ bronze PSU ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat_smile)"

If you don't think that the price that is being charged is fair value, don't buy the card. If none of these things appeal to you, don't buy anything until a card reaches whatever your personal requirements are.\n\nAMD delivered a card (9070 XT) that is either slightly behind its nearest competitor (5070 TI) for meaningfully less money, or well ahead of its nearest competitor (5070) for slightly more money. They've mostly closed the gap on raytracing workloads that don't use Nvidia-specific stuff, and largely equalised upscaling with FSR4 all while having fewer hardware faults and more robust drivers. That feels like a good deal to me, and apparently a bunch of people agree with that since they're outselling their competition by a fairly considerable margin atm.\n\nAll of the alternate universe BS where for some reason AMD released this exact card at this exact price despite every other circumstance being different and AMD charging head first into stepping on a rake anyway is a complete waste of time.\n\nEvaluate the market you're in. AMD did fine, probably did their reputation in the market a world of good, will probably gain some market share in this segment. Hopefully for the health of the market, the 9060s do well and they maintain a good position to be able to produce something great with their next major release.",

Yes, the numbers talk for themselves.\n\nWhat is interesting to me, is the number of graphics cores on 9070 XT is something like 20 cores less. Yet, it matches or beats the previous gen. 64 compute units compared to 84 on the 7900 XT for example. That is more than 20% less CUs. In other words, massive gains per CU.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XrX2yef7Vg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XrX2yef7Vg)\n\nOnly thing letting that card down is the scalping going on, including from the retailers, in my book.",

Personally the 12gb vram is a hard sell when you can get a 9070 for similar money with more vram, better raster performance and what looks to be decent RT performance and a software stack that is almost at parity. \n\n\nUltimately it comes down to how available either are and what you specific use case is. \n\n\nAMD drivers are not as bad as many make out and their adrenalin software is better than the Nvidia App in my opinion.",
      "I’d wait until you could get them at msrp. I have seen some 5070s for $550 but honestly if you’re playing at 2k or above i wouldn’t justify such a big purchase on a GPU with 12gb of vram. It’s precisely why I’m getting rid of my 4070ti. I got it for $675 and it’s been fantastic but at 3440x1440 it’s starting to worry me.",
      "9070 is significantly better than the 5070 get the 9070",
      "Xt and ti way too expensive imo so i want to stick to the regular versions",
      "Yea i think ima go with the rtx 5070 due to being able to get it at msrp unlike the rx 9070 and the vram wont really limit me in the games i play.",
      "100 dollars increase worth it?",
      ">what are u talking about the 5070 is the only card with decent avalability at msrp. The only day the 9070 have better stock was the day of launch.\n\nBecause there was actually a real stock of the 9070's, unlike the 5000's.\n\nAnd i dont know where do you live, but in my country there are no 5070 at MSRP, they all cost as much as 9070 while being considerably worse.\n\n>the cheapest 9070 costs over 20 percent more than the cheapest 5070 rn while not giving even 10 percent more perf on average.\n\nThe 9070 gives way more than 10 percent more perf than the 5070, which is one of the reasons both the 9070 and the xt are selling like hotcakes.",
      "I don't really trust pcpartpicker prices since it includes scalpers. I have personally seen the 9070 & 5070 in stock at $550 usd, and I would pick the 9070 over that, but I don't know how supply is doing in the canadian market. For me personally, I would not get a gpu with 12gb of vram",
      "Absolutely 100% 9070 has more vram and performance and not driver issues compared to the 50 series black screening",
      "Definitely will jump to 1440p",
      "Those kind of \"paper comparisons\" are useless, because at the end of the day the only thing that matters is real usage performance, and only benchmarks shows that, and in benchmarks the regular 9070 destroys the 5070 while also being considerably cheaper, the only thing the 5070 is better is in dlss 4, but AMD is catching Up to Nvidia with fsr4, and ray/pathtracing.\n\nHere i drop you a benchmark of al 9070's VS 5070's, but you can look for more of you want:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aWOBTszuXxI?si=6DbpeOsELEy2qGAB",
      "There are literally hundreds of videos in YouTube about the 9070 vs 5070, pick whichever you want, i only sent you that one because It was literally the first one Who appeared in my search.\n\nAnd as i said, what a \"reputable company\" says is irrelevant, the only thing that matters is how the card performs, and the only way of knowing that for sure before buying are with benchmarks."

      "Red devil getting slightly higher temps here than the other reviews I've seen, but performance is a wash anyways and Sapphire's industrial design can't be beat imo. Given how overbuilt even the \"cheap\" XTs are, though, it's hard to justify paying more than MSRP.",
      "Red devil has 0 noise. It's crazy. Even when running 100% usage, and undervolted with 3300 mhz.",
      "My Red Devil 7900XTX on the other hand, literally screams at me like the actual devil in certain situations. That boy got some coil whine. I love it though lol",
      "TLDR:   \nPerformance is almost identical between the 2 models   \n       \n- Sapphire Nitro+ RX 9070XT: Removable magnetic back plate cover, 3.2 slot, 330.8(L)X 128.5(W)X 65.68 (H)mm, 1591 gr (1898 gr with cover), support bracket included, **12V-2x6 power connector**, no Dual BIOS, consumes more power (346.5 W vs 327.7 W)    \n- PowerColor Red Devil RX 9070XT: 3.5 slots, 340(L)X 132(W)X 69(H)mm, 1538 gr, GPU holder included, 3x 8-pin power connectors, Dual BIOS, OC BIOS runs slightly hotter (62 vs 59 degrees), slightly more quiet",
      "I guess when some other brands push AMD power limits there's very not much benifit. It seems that PowerColor was aware of that and preffer to opt for much more silent operation rather than pushing the fan to operate at high speed just to get 1 or 2 frames per second. Props to PowerColor for that.\n\nFrom my understanding, PowerColor has their OC bios, 330W where Taichi is 340W and Sapphire 340W? not sure if anyone can confirm those.",
      "I love the Nitro+ but now im afraid of the 12V power connector because of Nvidia.",
      "I was going for the Nitro+ but it sold out in the 5 minutes it took me to drive to the store and they only had the red devil so I got it instead.\n\nWhile the aesthetic is certainly better on the nitro+ I still think, the red devil performs incredibly well, it is practically silent with no fan noise and no coil whine, exactly what I wanted.",
      "Cable is fine when 600 watts aren’t running through it.",
      "Crazy because mine doesn't make any noise.",
      "My Sapphire 9070XT reports as 330W. Can only increase power 10%, so 363W is maximum. The card itself reports its own power spikes in HWINFO, and I've seen as high as 575W (likely 1ms) under \"GPU Power Maximum.\" I like info like that.",
      "I have the nitro + it is a nice card. I also have the Gigabyte Aorus Elite coming as I got a killer deal on it. I'll try it out and see which one undervolts / OC better. So far for real world stability the Nitro + can only sustain -60mv underclock or it does driver crash in Helldivers 2 after a while.",
      "Yeah this seems like proper usage of the connector. Even with brief spikes it should be within tolerance. \n\nStill I wouldn't want it personally.",
      "Has to be Sapphire.",
      "The 9070xt Red Devil Limited Edition comes with a metal keycap for your enter key that has little fans that spin when you brush your finger across it.  For that alone, Red Devil wins for me because it is an amazing fidget spinner.",
      "The Nitro+ only draws 330w, around half of what the 12v cable is rated for.",
      "Not sure about the Nitro+ but my Taichi has had 6 near consecutive hours on full load several times with no connector issues so far. Swapping my old PSU with 12v horsepower to a new one with ATX 3.1 compatibility soon so hopefully nothing comes up with that.",
      "Can't wait to hear how you compare the Aorus Elite to the Nitro+. Also, nice to hear people being honest about their \"stable\" undervolts. So many people with \"yeah I'm 100% stable at -120mv and 2850 fast timings\" and it's like, 1. Your memory OC will crash in two minutes of memtest vulkan and 2. Your \"stable\" undervolt will crash under real world gaming conditions and probably in the boss battle.",
      "Seen somewhere that PowerColor Red Devil are 330W, which is just 10W less than Taichi I believe at 340W. It's interesting to see they actually had more power phases VS Sapphire, it's always a good thing for reliablity.\n\nLove the Red Devil design, had a couple from previous gens and they were always cool & super quiet.",

    "comments": [
      "Rx 9070xt is the better choice from what I’ve seen. They are pretty comparable in performance and the 9070 is cheaper",
      "It still comes down to the same considerations since last gen. \nOnly the differences are smaller then before as AMD has caught up a lot on both ray tracing and upscaling/frame generation.\n\nA) Is the great raster performance of AMD enough for you?\n -Buy AMD.\n\nB) Do you want to use ray tracing/path tracing a lot and also upscaling/ frame generation?\n -Buy Nvidia.\n\nIf you don't play the kind of games that you will find on digital foundry's best graphics of the year awards on youtube, you will probably not miss anything this generation by buying AMD. \n\nIf you want to play those high fidelity high end games, maxed out, you will still be better off with Nvidia. (Watch digital foundry's latest video about 9070xt performance on path tracing).\n\nEdit: moved one paragraph up",
      "I have the nitro its a phenomenal card with little overclocking im getting near 5080 performance",
      "As someone with a 9070xt, get the 5070ti for 1440p, Nvidia features are that good.",
      "Yes but I also compare valur of the model. Lowest 9070 xt is for 730e and in that case the price diff is 300e",
      "As someone who switched from nvidia, I am pleasantly surprised at how good amd’s software is, especially with the new fsr4 mod by optiscaler. I can even play some games with dlss inputs, converted into fsr4. \n\nThis is possible because of amd making fsr open source I believe, which nvidia would never do. And the software from amd has been great so far, with way more features than nvidia.",
      "The 5070 ti has about 9% better performance when not using ray tracing. It also has better upscaling. To me, that puts them at roughly equal value at their respective MSRPs. Both are good choices. Do you want better performance or lower cost?",
      "Why the hell would u want a 9070xt if u have the money for a 5070ti\nGet a 9070xt if u don't want ray tracing but who doesn't? U only live once if u have the money. And Reddit is 90% amd and want Nvidia to fail for some schizophrenic reason.\n\nNvidia is popular",
      "Ah if you have it already idk. Personally I'd just stick with the 9070xt at that point haha.",
      "[https://i.imgur.com/THNe9lq.png](https://i.imgur.com/THNe9lq.png)\n\nFSR is open source. Not to mention, the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds also hates nvidia, and has openly criticized how difficult it was to work with them. And nvidia's software is actually horrible. It doesn't even let you use the software without creating a nvidia account. Do I need to explain why that is a bad thing?\n\nNot to mention how the overlay and geforce apps hurt performance, with many features being hit or miss in many games. AMD's software includes features like overclocking, monitoring, etc. and there is zero effort in using it (Especially no account creation needed). So no, Nvidia's software is not miles ahead, it's behind in many ways.\n\nDLSS4 might be good, but FSR4 comes very close, and looks like it will only get better with time, just like DLSS did.\n\nEdit: Oh, and regarding your point about game support for optiscaler, if you had just read the huge note that is mentioned, in bold, at the top of the compatibility list, you may have found that the list isn't complete, as Optiscaler FSR4 just got released and is in alpha  -\n\n\"**This is** `not` **a complete list of games supported by OptiScaler.**\n\nOptiScaler is compatible with most games that support `DLSS 2+`, `FSR 2+` or `XeSS`.  \nThe list below includes games and configuration options shared by our community members.\"",

Not exactly smashing it out of the park, according to me.\n\nEdit: it's the 9070xt with 37fps. To be clear.",
      "If it's the same money get the 5070ti, rt is faster. It all depends on the price. Where I am from 5070 at launch was more expensive than 9070xt by 300 euro. Now they are similarly priced and that makes the 9070xt a better choice, though both are horrible priced. The 5070ti is even worse. Honestly at 1100 dollars like you said you have them, they are both horrible priced. That gpu is worse than the 1000 dollars 4080 super, and you pay more for it.",
      "Not just better raytracing. Dlss4 is still better quality than FSR4 and better game support (yes optiscaler, but native support is betterer). Mfg actually looks pretty compelling, reviews are decent",
      "I own a 5070ti and for that price just go with the 9070XT, it's very very close to 5070ti basically it's a tie. They both outperform each other depending upon the title. But I must say after coming from a 7800XT, the ray tracing and path tracing feels next level with dlss but then again it's not worth the extra 150$ in my opinion, maybe extra 50$ at max",
      "Honestly might be one of the best takes I’ve seen on the situation.\n\nI’ve been feeling bad about my purchase of a 5070 with all the hate going around but the performance gaps seem so neglible for casual gaming and I’m very much the type of person to crank on all the graphics settings so the game looks pretty.\n\nWith how I play I’d rather path tracing over higher fps",
      "Not to mention Nvidia's stinginess with VRAM, which limits the lifespan of most of their more expensive cards for said high fidelity games.",
      "This is a great explanation for why one should buy one or the other. I personally bought a 9070 (non xt) but I did because of what this man said. I don't do AAA gaming and I wanted the extra vram for more future proofing. Either way op goes though, I hope he is happy",
      "Derbaur recommends undervolting the card and increasing the power target, effectively boosting clock speeds - giving about a 10% boost over stock... 👍",
      "This is the opinion I value the most..someone with both AMD and NVIDIA experience.",
      "Thats the case I am also looking at it money wise. I wanna know if nearly 300e difference for base models is fair price diff. I used to have 7900xt and before 6900xt so not using RayTracing so extensively is not a big loss for me bht from what I have tested Rtx is pretty solid even on this 9070xt. But PT is tragic thats for sure.\n\nIf only there were msrp 5070ti ...I would take it right away :D"

      "\"The Radeon RX 9070 series Linux experience was stable (I didn't encounter a single hang / kernel oops or any other problems like that!) and was smooth from desktop to gaming. It was a very pleasant initial AMD RDNA4 experience on Linux. This was a great at-launch experience using the upstream and open-source driver support from AMD. The one thing though... There's room left for performance optimizations. The main downside of my initial Linux testing was that the performance wasn't as great as what's been reported under Windows 11 with the official Radeon Windows driver. Relative to the Radeon RX 7900 series on Windows, the RX 9070 performance on Linux was less enticing right now.\"",
      "You don't typically \"update drivers\" in Linux. You update the kernel.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n\"What you're probably wanting to know first up as a Linux gamer/enthusiast... All of the Radeon RX 9070 series support is upstream in the Linux kernel and Mesa.  \\[...\\]\n\nOn the kernel side, Linux 6.12 LTS and newer is what's recommended for the Radeon RX 9070 series. Linux 6.12 is last year's Long Term Support kernel version and fortunately the RX 9070 series support should be \"good enough\" for those using that version. But as is typically the case with new hardware support at launch, the newer the kernel the better. So if able to, using Linux 6.13 stable is recommended and the Linux 6.14 kernel will be out later this month. For my testing I was using Linux 6.14 Git to enjoy the most up-to-date AMD open-source driver support available.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nAMD has tested the Radeon RX 9070 series to be working out-of-the-box on the likes of Fedora 41 or with Ubuntu 25.10 as well when fetching the latest AMDGPU firmware files. The needed RX 9070 / RDNA4 firmware files are all upstream in linux-firmware.git, so make sure you have those bits as well if planning to buy a Radeon RX 9070 series graphics card.\"\n\nSo find a distro with the kernel version you need and/or update Mesa as per the instructions in the article. Or wait for kernel updates on the distro you're using.",

And then the ones that there are, sometimes break like a number of the now-older Feral game ports not working nicely on modern distros. Occasionally Proton (Steam Play) causing issues for some Windows games, etc.\n\nSolutions used by some Windows reviewers like Auto Hot Keys and the like unfortunately don't work on Linux especially with X11/Wayland differences, complications around Proton, etc.\n\nIn turn I am also relying on what the game / game engine exposes for performance data and do show frame times where exposed and the like with some of the overlay/external reporting not always working out accurately/reliably on Linux I prefer to source just from the game engine...\n\nTLDR: if there is any newer games that work on Linux that are automated/benchmark friendly, I am more than happy to incorporate them but they are rare. That's also in part why many of the Linux GPU driver developers just rely on repeating shader runs and the like but aren't realistic there either for not executing the game logic, etc.",

While the following suggestion is still a synthetic benchmark and thus doesn't really address my concern, Decay might be worth including to represent Godot Engine.\n\nI wonder if it'd be worth mentioning this to developers of native Linux games while they're still in early access; many might not realize this is a desirable feature to build into their games. I'm sure that there are at least a few who would be motivated to do so if it gave them a good shot at being featured on Phoronix. Maybe reach out to Alderon Games and/or Kerzoven?",

They do have some suitable benchmarks but alas not the type of benchmarks gamers would want to see...\n\ne.g. [https://benchmarks.godotengine.org/](https://benchmarks.godotengine.org/)  \n[https://github.com/godotengine/godot-benchmarks](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-benchmarks)\n\nLooking more at the primitive engine performance and would be likely more criticized then Xonotic or other open-source games but not modern...\n\nFor game developers I do interact with, I do passionately promote for better benchmarking support to encourage testing by reviewers / more likely to be tested by IHVs and ISVs / etc. Sadly though the investment by the game developers in working on such capabilities typically doesn't pan out for them in a quantifiable manner.",

For example the 7800 is one die lower than the 7900s, while the 6800 was the sane die as the 6900s.\n\nNgl I got a 6800xt for 300GBP and I'm still on the fence about if 9070xt is even worth it right now.",

If you've tried using MangoHUD for this purpose, I'd be interested in hearing why you decided not to go with it. If you haven't tried it yet, perhaps it would be a good thing to test.",
      "MangoHUD can take care of performance metrics (there were some issues with Wayland/X11 and accuracy, but that's been I think a few years since I heard about any issues or at least aside from compositor bugs) but that still doesn't take care of automating the game/execution logic for being able to automatically launch and replay a desired scene for reliably ensuring given settings are applied and reproducible scene/etc are used (where AutoHotKeys is used by some Windows reviewers for similar games paired with FRAPS or other programs). It can work for a couple select games (and I used a similar approach for some now-obsolete UE4 benchmark demos with an overlay) but it unfortunately doesn't really help in any large manner.",

The best example is how the 4080 sold extremely poorly at $1200 but as soon as it was re-released as the 4080 Super at $1000 it suddenly started sellling well: basically the customers that had $1200 to spare could go up to $1600 for a 4090 and beyond with no problem, and this is what would have happened to a hypothetical 9080 card at >$1000 (because the die size would have been ridiculously big and the yields, potentially mediocre).",

      "Interesting part:\n\nFinally, we have some concerns about how \"real\" the $600 MSRP actually is. After some investigation, it appears that AMD is providing retailers with a $50 rebate to achieve the $600 pricing. This strongly suggests the intended MSRP was actually $650, and AMD is temporarily subsidizing models to hit the lower price point.\n\nFor example, XFX confirmed that the 9070 XT Mercury – a model featured in this review – will not cost $650. In fact, it won't even cost $700. Instead, the official MSRP is $770, and due to tariffs, its on-shelf price is expected to be $850 – which would be tragic if true.\n\nFrom what we've gathered, it seems AMD is starting to play Nvidia's pricing game. This means that while some 9070 XT models may be available at $600 initially, most will likely be priced higher, and restocks at that price may be limited or infrequent. A lot will depend on how sales perform. AMD has a large stock of Radeon 9070 GPUs, so if demand slows after launch, we expect them to continue offering rebates to keep pricing competitive. However, we will have to wait and see how that plays out.",
      "The rebate could also just be covering the increased cost for the tariffs and that 600 is indeed the intended price.\n\nSo we could see prices go up in the US if tariffs don't go away.",
      "something is wrong with their setup because there are huge inconsistencies between 2k and 4k for all games",
      "lol above $800 the card would be DOA",
      "I like the Taichi card the best aesthetically, it looks really nice. But the premium on it is kinda yikes. the spreadsheet says 740 for the taichi so an extra $140. Not sure thats worth it. DEFINITLY dont buy the asus ones imo. Asus is just a crappy company that has been doing some shady and even illegal stuff with not honoring warranties and such. The premiums on their cards is also outrageous.",
      "The mining boom already proved that when no cards are available that people will pay over MSRP to get SOMETHING. Whatever they end up selling for, it won't be anything close to what Nvidia gpus are going for right now. Saw a 5070 ti get listed for $1250 on eBay and sold almost immediately this morning",
      "The spreadsheet says that the taichi will be 740. If thats true im still not sure I really like that price, 140$ is a lot to ask for on a card that has an MSRP of 599. It does have the 3100 boost clock though and the other AIB cards that have the 3100 boost clock have higher premiums than this card has, if the spreadsheet is right.",
      "esa madre deberia costar 12 mil pesos mexicanos y vale 25 mil XD se pasan de lanza los revendedores.",
      "It's interesting HUB maintain the standpoint of \"Reviewers should always test using best CPU to remove any potential bottleneck in GPU benchmarks\" (see their B580 performance using midrange CPUs video, where viewers questioned testing using 9800x3D on midrange cards).\n\n\nBut their test benches always use pretty mediocre SSD. This time it's MSI SPATIUM M470, PCIe 4.0 drive that barely beats PCIe 3.0 ones, even slower than Crucial P5 at times. Last year they used TeamGroup Cardea A440, also a pretty average drive.",
      "Its going to be 750-850 depending on model.  On the scalped market its going to be $1200-1400.  Its going to be the same price as the 5070 Ti with slightly less performance.  I have been through this multiple times, the price will not be competitive.",
      "Being able to buy the card is key. I feel it'll be sold out in < 10 seconds everywhere. I mean if you want to stand out in line at a microcenter then so be it.",
      "Bingo."

I'd have to spend $150+ more on another to use the XT.",

      "cant get it in Europe anyway. seems like none of these big tech companies want my money I guess.",
      "Yes! The undervolt allows the GPU clock to stay around 2200 - 2400 Mhz. But it depends on the game/workload. I just tried Path of Exile 2, and its performance hit from stock is about 11%, whereas Medieval Dynasty only lost about 2%.\n\nI was really curious about this when I bought it - reviewers did not do much undervolting. Almost went with the 9070 because I was afraid of the heat in my ITX case, but it's totally a non-issue.",
      "I wonder later on if it’s possible, like in the past with AMD GPUs such as the 5700 (which could have its BIOS flashed to a 5700 XT or even AMD Vega 56 to 64), to perform a similar BIOS flash on the AMD 9000 series GPUs since they're the same die. Majority of the AMD 9070 has 2x8 PCIE and some model has 3x8 PCIE which is unusual for a card that's power efficient, maybe the power is locked via software?",
      "its really efficient. Mine is using 0 watts.",
      "I tried to get an XT but they sold out quickly, 9070 was going in and out of stock a lot and then I saw the price jump from £525 to £539 and they came back in stock and I said, F it, and pulled the trigger. \n\nClose enough to MSRP to be happy, like under 15 quid difference. \n\nHad been wanting a 7800 XT or 7900 GRE for a while now which the 9070 handily beats both of and if I got the XT version I would have probably had to upgrade my PSU too which I really wanted to avoid.",
      "Is there any real reason for a 9070 at 1080p/60 FPS though? I guess heavy RT content might warrant it, but I feel like you could have gotten into one of several RTX 3000 and newer models for that performance bracket.",
      "For a drastic decrease in power (what, 50%?) I believe this is an excellent tradeoff still. 11% to stay cool and silent is okay, not to mention energy bills and, oh yeah, eco friendliness.",

      "Wrong. I've personally had both at the same time, the reaper is louder and runs hotter. Both cards keep extremely low average temperatures, but the 9070 xt in general has quite high hotspot/memory temps. The pulse is slightly better at cooling the hotspot and memory than the reaper.",
      "I don't think it's anything more than a very minor aesthetic issue either way.",
      "One thing to note, as I said earlier average temps are negligible in difference, as both are more than adequately low. The main difference between the two is hotspot and memory temps where the pulse slightly outperforms.  \nMemory on pulse maxes at 84c on stock settings and reaper at 92c. Hotspot hovers around 80c at max load on the pulse (don't have hotspot max for my reaper and I no longer own the card). At idle the reaper averaged around 40c with 52c hotspot with the pulse averaging around 34c and 40c hotspot in my rig (ncase T1 v2.5).  \nI did turn off zero RPM mode on both cards, as in my case it would simply choke out the cards at idle due to the constraints of the case I built in.  \n  \nEDIT: I'd like to note one more thing, these numbers are solely from gaming and gaming benchmarks, max temperatures in synthetic benchmarks are likely higher.",

I don't care nowadays, I use a console like case and de shroud my GPUs, 7800xt was quieter than the 5700xt but I give a damn, 3000rpm are still acoustics of such rpm, my fans didn't improve the thermals BUT even at 100% they move only a Max of 2000rpm waaaay quieter.",

Windows didn't BSOD but it wasn't pleasant to run into such issues with a brand new card.\n\nEspecially since now I have that .. I can run RDR2, Space Marine 2, etc. in full ultra settings without a single problem.",

      "All of MSI's GPU's have nice fan curves. They are probably the least intrusive in terms of behavior (no start up rattle, low starting RPM, no aggressive changes, etc).",
      "You should be running a custom fan curve tailored to your PC's specific acoustic and performance needs.\n\nThe stock one just is there to get you started",

And i actually wonder why the drastic price change? The 7800 XT got a total die size of 346mm2. This is just slightly smaller than the 9070 XT's die size of 357 mm2. \n\nThis smells like AMD trying to play in the same profit ballpark as Nvidia at the expense of PC gamers once again.

Even if stuff gets re-reviewed customers do not generally look for those. \n\nLook at how RDNA2 and RDNA3 price cut over time, did it help their reputation any? Not one bit outside of niche subreddits and the mindfactory/microcenter customer bases. \n\nA bad launch review clings to a product. It also makes the assumption that Nvidia won't have stock of lower SKUs to dump into channels just to embarrass AMD. Nvidia has turned around numerous times and out-maneuvered AMD when they thought they were being clever. \n\nAMD needs to nail the launch, not play the same bullshit games they've been playing for a decade now.",
      "5070ti is not 750.  Even when it's in stock the \"base\" models are 900.  The 750 models don't actually exist.\n\n  \nCurrent MSRPs are a joke.\n\n  \nI'm fairly sure, in the current market where the local Microcenter has literally 0 gaming gpus over 400 dollars on the shelves, the 9070 xt at 700 bucks, on shelves, will sell out.

Further more, they have the capability to open-source it for the community to modify it. \n\nEither way, this highly competitive GPU from AMD if sold and found at MSRP will be one of many stings that would finally make Jensen Huang care about gamers again. Don't forget this 5000 series uses the same TSMC 4nm lithography as the 4000 series from two years ago, all gains are superficial and scales linearly with transistor count, cuda cores, and power consumptions, etc.",

      "I'm surprised he does not know why this happens. With ECC (error correcting memory), you will hit performance degradation instead of crashes with memory overclocking. That's because the GPU will stall waiting for the correct data while the memory controller keeps retrying until it is able to fetch correctly. Without ECC, it just returns the garbage making the program crash if the corruption hits a sensitive data piece (or until then, you will see visual artifacts). I'm oversimplifying here, but that's the gist.\n\nIt's a great feature that avoids most data corruption, but it does make it much harder to see if your new memory settings are fine during stress tests or not.",
      "I really expected a guy like derbauer to know about memory correction at too high clocks. Kinda disappointing",
      "I'm surprised he was surprised about the memory oc performance degradation. How long has it been since we had mem oc artifacts?",
      "FWIW, a commenter pointed this out to him and he saw it and replied with, I think, \"Makes sense. Thanks.\" So, he knows now, at least.",
      "4k native. Watch the video maybe?",
      "He wasn't trying to match anything. That was just the performance of the card when overclocked.\n\nMaybe watch the video before making assumptions.",
      "Mine takes -155mV and +10% power for a nice 3330 MHz clock, nearly 9% boost. Some one else here got 3400 MHz.\n\nEdit: Crashes in some games, had to back off to -70mV for stability.\n\nVRAM clock could take a boost to 2760MHz easily though!",
      "Me gusta explanatione!",
      "No, he's not. People just need to stop thinking that any kind of critique is an emotional response.",
      "Yup, memory correction has been a thing since GDDR5 iirc\n\nI wanted to say GDDR3 but I couldn't find any info on that having it.",
      "No, the ECC on regular DDR5 is not nearly good enough to correct for errors from running it too fast. \n\nFCLK on AMD AM5 platform is though and it'll show signs of errors instead of failing outright, like audio stutters and performance drops.",
      "Supposedly, his OC matched a 5080 in Cyberpunk.    Maybe he just had a golden sample though or just that 1 game.",
      "Plus not calling the undervolt with higher power limit overclocking is something",
      "Unfortunately, data shows that they get more views when they use that type of thumbnail. Too much brain rot in society.",
      "AMD had ECC on the RX 6000 series already.",
      "10% extra performance and lower temperatures through undervolting. Feel free not to comment on something you’ve no clue about. Would make Reddit a better place.",
      "Not everyone bases their GPU purchases off RT. A $600 GPU that matches a $1,000 GPU in anything it still noteworthy.",
      "Im curious if that happens with regular ddr5 too. It has bit correction but does it degrade performance ? I believe none of the memory tests show if ddr5 stick itself correct anything or not. And would it cause weird erratic ssd read speed variances.",
      "I thought -125mV was stable on mine because it ran time spy without issues, but when I was playing some other games, I saw instability issues. I then tried Steel Nomad and saw driver crashes. I had to die it down to -80mV before the crashes stopped.",

      "Worth mentioning, that ray tracing includes black myth wukong, which is completely broken on AMD and is basically bruteforced, so it Heavily bricks the results for ray tracing on AMD cards. It's ~5-6% better average if you exclude it (since it's a huge outlier)",
      "This. Removing the statistical anomaly or highlighting it would be helpful for a more accurate understanding.",
      "I was planning to buy an RTX 5070 but everyone on the internet told me to wait for RX 9000.\n\nI bought a Gigabyte Gaming OC RX 9070 XT for 85 USD more than the cheapest RTX 5070 in my country🙂\n\nThank you people. My RX 9070 XT demolishes the RTX 5070 where it matters. I believe the 5070 only beats it in path tracing and Black Myth Wukong.\n\nEdit : For those wondering here was my options in my terrible country (expensive GPUs, low wages, 3rd world)\n\nRTX 5070 : 85 USD cheaper than the RX 9070 XT\n\nRTX 5070ti : 195 USD more expensive than 9070 XT\n\nI'm very happy with my choice.",
      "Perhaps watch the DF video on Avatar?  It's one of the best implementations of GI and other RT features (bar the path tracing titles).\n\nIt runs well on AMD not because its RT is bad but probably because it favours AMD in raster and so when Heavy RT settings are used AMD GPU's have a bit more cushion for extra performance drop.",
      "Worth mentioning that Black myth wukong uses a specific Nvidia fork of unreal engine. Not a conspiracy to assume that Nvidia cards have primary focus on that engine.",
      "Cant buy either for sane price in Europe",
      "He's talking about Black Myth Wukong results being an outlier due to raytracing in that game being broken for AMD. Not the existence of raytracing games being an outlier.",
      "TLDR, just look at the average row for each set. It's normalized to a 5070, so if the average line for a card is 110%, that means it's 10% faster than a 5070.",
      "Test was done at very high RT. The usual usage of it, not PT level. For BMW and Alan wake it's PT, actually, that is why it is borked. In Alan wake both vendors die anyway, so having 20 fps on AMD or 25 on 5070 - who cares. Cyberpunk RT works great on both cards and that's what will be in future games.\n\nBMW on the other hand, is completely broken on AMD. Like, it's a sabotage at this point.",
      "No, but the RX 9070 XT beats the rtx 5070 (12GB) even in Ray Tracing😂 Its path tracing where it falls flat on its face, but that's a super duper tiny Sacrifice I am willing to make. \n\nThe RX 9070 XT beats the RTX 5070 in Cyberpunk at 1440p Ray Tracing Ultra preset and basically anything that isn't path tracing I believe (besides Black Myth RT)\n\nI got significantly faster raster  , a little bit faster RT and 16GB VRAM for only 85 USD more. The RTX 5070ti (16GB)  is almost 200 USD more expensive than the RX 9070 XT I bought\n\nI love this card. I just finished undervolting the card. I am getting 230w avg power usage and -3.5% perf decrease",
      "This is many number, and I many stupid…\n\nIs there a TLDR?",
      "Games that rely on RT only like Indiana Jones and Metro Exodus work well on AMD cards so IDK what that guy is talking about. Wukong just runs badly on AMD.",
      "No, the game specifically is an outlier. Cyberpunk with path tracing on all other AMD cards before this performed similarly with the 7900xtx falling behind even the 3060 Ti, but performance is much better with the 9070 and 9070XT. The 9070 XT performs on par with a 4070 in path tracing in Cyberpunk now and heavy RT results across the board are miles better than last generation... But Wukong still performs like shit.\n\n5070 is 15-20% faster in Cyberpunk PT and 73% faster in Black Myth Wukong for some reason.",
      "Same situation in Australia. These companies only care about the American market.",
      "nice",
      "how do you come to that conclusion? the 9070 is faster, the 9070xt is faster than the 4070 super.\n\nIts faster than the super and the same price (or 9070 is less).\n\nVery bad TLDR",
      "BM:W catching strays for no reason.",
      "Also don't forget access to FSR4 when choosing between 9000 and 7000 cards. It's apparently a night and day difference",
      "It's a huge outlier and statistics doesn't work that way.\n\n\nIf you keep the broken crap - the difference is 20%. If you ignore that one single crap - it's 10% or so. And that might be a very important thing for buying decision.\n\n\nSo yes, it is important to mention the outlier, so people can see that a make their decision correctly. Because in other RT games AMD is very competitive, like in cyberpunk or avatar or star wars.",
      "GNexus review kept BM:W out of the main averaging and still reported the NVIDIA as better in RT. But said 9070 XT was a good buy for MSRP."

      "Good price for the 9700XT and a terrible one for the 9700. It's such a \"I don't want to sell this\" price.",
      "Own a NVIDIA RTX 2060, first time ive felt swayed towards AMD with the 9070 XT, What are peoples thoughts?   \n  \nShould the trigger on a purchase be pulled?",
      "While this it true nvidia historically will not touch its prices, we will only see a shift if amd is successful in clawing back the market. It’s a 90-10 split.. they have a lot of work to do.",
      "You have no real reason to consider nvidia this go round.  The average 5070ti is $900. \n\n\nEven if you're afraid to lose dlss, I wouldn't call a $300 dlss tax reasonable.",
      "9070 XT looks pretty compelling since it offers close to XTX raster and better RT performance than it, it also deals with 5070 Ti really well overall.\n\n9070 at 549$ seems like a big fail, but while customers will hate the price, one also should understand that:\n\n\\* N4 yields are very good right now, so AMD doesn't want you to get the non XT cards anymore\n\n\\* Unlike 7700 XT/7900 XT, 9070 has the same memory subsystem as the XT, so it also costs almost as much to make.",
      "There always seems to be some excuse to buy Nvidia for some people. It sometimes gets tiring having to defend my decision to buy AMD when people respond to comments questioning why the hell I didn't buy Nvidia, as if to them the idea of not automatically buying Nvidia no matter the price or usefulness of feature set is unfathomable.\n\n(in terms of gaming only, I can't speak to uses outside of that where Nvidia does perform better in other applications)",
      "If the 5070 outsells this, it's the consumers that are the problem. The 9070XT is like one and a half tiers up in terms of performance and has 4GB extra VRAM for $50 more.",
      "$599 should be around 699€ (20% tax included)",
      "Welp..  The price actually looks good.\n\nTime to strap in for another painful week while we wait for 3rd party benchmarks....\n\nLooks like I can easily dump my 3070 on Facebook marketplace for around $300.  The question remains...  Can I even get the 9070XT?  And will it really be $599?",
      "Make it 729-749€ for those above 20% (23% in my country). Meanwhile 5070ti is 900€-1000€.",
      "It’s also manufacturing, they don’t want to sell a ton of binned 9070s because their yields are good enough that they would have to artificially bin fully functioning chips to meet the demand if they sold it at a cheaper price.",
      "They also caved to the backlash of the \"4080 12GB\" and renamed it to 4070 TI with a price drop.",
      "Lol my favorite excuse is the one where they go \"yea but Nvidia has CUDA\" and when I respond and ask them \"what is CUDA and what do you use it for\" I immediately get crickets."

      "It lists Flux Schnell for 7900XTX and Flux dev only for W7900 class cards?\n\nFlux dev under WSL2 under ROCm under Comfy UI uses around 19GB VRAM in 1024x1024 and run in around 60 seconds. Under linux native people report around 45s inference time. [The catch is that it's hardcore to get ROCm to accelerate pytorch.](https://github.com/OrsoEric/HOWTO-7900XTX-Win-ROCM)\n\nI wonder if AMD were conservative with their settings, or if there is still an enormous penalty with ONNX runtime. When I tried AMUSE last time it had an incredible penality, it had around 1/20th of the performance compared even with ROCm+Zluda+Comfy UI.\n\nWhen i get around to it I'll try it.\n\nI really wish AMD picked ONE stack, and focused on that working fine. If AMD want to focus on ONNX, it's fine with me, just make that acceleration seamless, and make reliable binaries for pytorch.",

A neat trick is you can add a camera save file name to the prompt to get models to output more photorealistic images.  I add DSCF1234 which is a Fuji camera image file.",

      "So, i gave it a go.\n\nI downloaded Amuse 3.0. Installed it and run it. I clicked on the \"expert\" button, then \"model manager\" and then i clicked on \"download model\". I chose the Stable Diffusion tab and downloaded the one named \"SD3.5 (AMDGPU)\". It's a hefty download weighing at 18.5GB. (i went to expert and try to chose a model because Amuse would prompt to download the DS3.5 Medium model and after reading a bit i realised that its output quality isn't as good as the Large model)\n\nIt's a bit slow on my 9070 XT (i guess, haven't done this again). It took almost 5 minutes to generate this image.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/m5eowavkggve1.gif\n\nEdit: That time is with 40 steps.",

      "I don't know anything about how AI programs are used.\n\nWill i be able to use this with ease? Is this a one-click-install with an interface i can use with my utter ignorance?",
      "It seems like a lot of people aren't too knowledgeable about locally installed image generators. Tbh, i'm not an expert myself but i've been doing a lot of testing and found out a lot of things and how it works through trial and error. I'm personally most interested in photo realistic photos it can generate. FLux and AMD SD3.5 (Large) are usually the ones providing the best results. Flux i find tends to make skins a bit too smooth, i'll still need to investigate more with that, i'm sure there's a way around it. But essentially the exact prompts you use, guidance scale, even inference steps matter a lot. Even slight changes especially in the prompt section can dramatically change the output photo. I have an AMD 9800X3D CPU, 64 GB RAM and AMD 9070 XT GPU. I will show a photo i generated below (note - quality of the image i have is a lot better than what you see, for some reason, i can only upload gifs so i had to convert it to that file which lowered the quality).\n\nYou will also notice a seed number, this number is generated at random at the end of processing the image and is kind of like a unique tag. Thankfully if you save the image, that seed number is part of the image file name. Only thing so far that i don't like about amuse is i don't believe theres a way to say the exact prompts used in the metadata of the image, or at least generate some text file. As i mentioned, seed number is important if you want to generate similar images, but if you want very similar images, you will need the seed number and also your exact prompts used. I used prompts and negative prompts to generate this image (Negative prompts are basically prompts you add to tell the model what not to generate in the image, such as blurry photos, incorrect anatomy etc.)\n\nI cannot stress enough, prompts have to be exact, even if you remove say a full stop at the end of your prompt, that will generate a slightly different image, even with the same seed number used. In other words, if i gave you my exact prompts used, Guidance level, inference steps and seed number, you will be able to generate this exact image below.  Unfortunately because it doesn't record your prompts used, or even the model used to generate the image, all this information is lost unless you record it yourself, for now i create a folder with the best images and then add a text file along with it, recording things like prompts, Guidance level, inference steps etc, so i know the exact variables i used, so if i want to go back and generate the same image and then change variables slightly to get the same image, then i have the ability to do so (the eact layout resolution you use matters too so something to remember).  seed number itself won't be enough if you want to generate images that look very close to an existing image.\n\nIf anyone has any questions, let me know and i'll try to assist.\n\n\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/lo5itzjobsve1.gif",
      "Yea I tried it, seems you can't easily load other SD models than the ones they allow you to download, and the filtering is so insane, it'll hit random prompts  and just give you a blurred mess, if it said 'detected \"X\"' or something where it could tell you why that might help, but just getting a blurred image and you having to search for why something isn't working is a bad UI experience. Meanwhile SD.Next works great.",

It's in a single RT benchmark with frame generation, the same marketing BS that Nvidia did to say the 5070 was bringing 4090 performance.\n\n2. It's comparing a leaked benchmark from one unknown source to the tweeter's own benchmark.\n\n3. Even past that trash, the article is rounding up an extra 10% in performance to call it \"almost 4x.\"\n\nSo, we've got two different data sources that aren't using identical setups being pumped up by frame gen, then getting a second pumping from the article author's rounding crap.",
      "stupid post",
      "“in wukong benchmark cinematic RT + frame gen fsr50%“",
      "crazy we get these posts when AMD already released performance numbers. The 9070XT is around 65-70% faster than the 6800XT 🤦‍♂️\n\n4x faster.. that is about as dumb as nvidia claiming the 5070 is faster than the 4090 😂",
      "Framegen just invalidates the result lol",
      "AMD doesn't have multiframegen tho, which was the biggest reason 5070 fps was exaggerated to be 4x the actual",
      "At this point, I don't care for rumors. Reviews are live tomorrow, and a lot of the reviews I've seen so far for the 5070 have said we should keep an eye out so I'm interested in RT. I know raster will be good.",
      "If framegen gets that high, base fps is what 120?",
      "9070xt uses basically same boosts than 6800xt, but they are comparing ray tracing performance, on which 6800xt is pretty much unusable so it's relatively easy to quadruple the fps",
      "No, it's an Apple-like comparison",
      "....\n\nPretty misleading title as they picked a game that's RT heavy and run it against 6800xt.",
      "The GN video today made the 5070 MF claim look way worse. Its not even close.",
      "I need to know what the rt numbers look like tho.",
      "What a load of BS!\n\nIf the 9070XT is 4x faster than the 6800XT that means it will be the fastest GPU in the world, surpassing the 5090 by a significant margin \n\nWhen you want to lie, at least make it doable",
      "Why? What's stopping 6800 XT from using exactly the same framegen?\n\n\nLol indeed. Someone clearly doesn't know anything about critical thinking.\n\n```\nRX 6800 XT under the same settings\n```",
      "Hell yeah, shame OP, shame!",
      "\"The[ leaked benchmarks](https://x.com/GawroskiT/status/1896838352844026103) seem to come from the Chinese forum Chiphell but were posted on X by tech enthusiast Tomasz Gawroński, who showed the RX 9070 XT reportedly being 263% faster, delivering 69 FPS compared to just 19 FPS on the RX 6800 XT under the same settings. **The test was conducted at 4K resolution with** ***cinematic ray tracing*****, frame generation, and FSR set to 50%, making it a demanding scenario that favors the** [**improved ray tracing of RX 9000 series GPUs**](https://www.pcguide.com/news/significant-gen-over-gen-gains-in-rt-titles-amd-claim-2x-rt-performance-in-9000-series-gpu-lineup/)**.\"**\n\nIt's with RT on. It's just expected.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/50b4biez1qme1.gif",
      "Exactly, and unlike Nvidia, AMD never claimed this",
      "based on steve's review from GN on the 5070, everyone should wait a day before making a decision and he kept referencing how the 7900XT was beating the 5070 in too many situations even some with RT but who knows what that was about.",

      "Huh? The release is today? So you're saying the drivers they have had are different than drivers actual players get today? And were this the case, it's not to blame AMD?",
      "I mean I made the comment at like 2pm on embargo day lol. But it's definitely a scope thing, amd can't be expected to hit the mark on 100% sable drivers in every game.\n\nAnd I was just speculating, typically a driver release happens day one of purchase. So \"pre release\" isn't untrue.\n\nI'm not saying they aren't to blame but you kinda just have to look at the bigger picture of \"new GPU architecture, millions of games\" picking up what I'm laying down?",
      "Yes it's possible that game might have something related to their drivers.\n\nI meant, that say they give reviewers a week to do their tests, then as the release is one day after the reviews are out, 8 days is not really much time to improve the drivers."

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/rd50e2ifrvle1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=07a9a0bdf823e033da1e308433fe615be7fa0f0d\n\nThe latest generation of AMD graphics cards is now upon us. If you've recently upgraded your motherboard to one of our new X870 or recently launched B850 or B840 motherboards, you might feel like it's time to continue the AMD trend and upgrade your graphics card. \n\nFor those who are less familiar with the new cards, here are the new main features:  \n\n* The new RDNA 4 architecture  \n* 16GB GDDR6 VRAM \n* Next-gen HYPR-RX tech delivers ultra-fast gaming  \n* New AMD AI-powered technologies, including an improved experience with ray-tracing. \n* Machine-learning based super resolution mode compatible with select FSR 3.1 games provide an incredible balance of detailed images and fluid frame rates. \n* DisplayPort 2.1 outputs give users massive bandwidth for going big on resolution while supporting high-end refresh rates \n\nOn the ASUS side, we've implemented a number of new changes to our cooling design, PCB design, and optional software:\n\n**Phase-Change Thermal Pads Provide a Long-Lasting Cooling Experience** \n\nOne new change for our graphics cards this year is that we're switching from standard thermal paste used on the GPU and thermal module to phase-change thermal pads. \n\nWhen transferring heat, the electrically non-conductive pad is a solid at room temperature but liquifies as it heats up. As it melts, it fills the microscopic gaps between the GPU and thermal module, providing superior thermal conductivity and enhanced heat dissipation, ensuring optimal performance, even for sustained, heavy GPU workloads.   \n\nAdditionally, the phase-change thermal pads offer exceptional longevity. They outlast traditional pastes by a significant margin, even for graphics cards that see heavy workloads on a regular basis.  \n\n**ASUS GPU Tweak III Software** \\- Some gamers prefer to tune their graphics cards for all-out performance, while others insist on quiet operation. A physical Dual BIOS switch lets users choose between performance and quiet modes without installing additional software. For more performance-tuning options, easy hardware monitoring and granular control of fan behavior, users can download the free ASUS GPU Tweak III software. \n\n**ASUS GPU Guard & Bracket\\*** \\- ASUS GPU Guard applies adhesive to secure all four corners to reduce the risk of cracks, while a GPU bracket helps ensure uniform mounting pressure and extra stability. \n\n**Protective PCB Coating\\*** \\- A protective conformal coating envelops the circuit board to help protect against short-circuits caused by moisture, dust or debris. \n\n\\*Available only on the TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 cards \n\n**TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition and TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4zxtc3j5nvle1.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12bb410662c4cb748df61dacfc3650076364fd11\n\nTUF Gaming graphics cards utilize an unassuming style that fits in easily with just about any components on the market. For the TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, ASUS has retained the classic ruggedized aesthetic of the series. An illuminated TUF Gaming logo on the corner of the card provides a touch of personalization, and it supports ASUS Aura Sync so users can coordinate its lighting with the rest of their compatible gear. \n\nThe TUF Gaming design for this series delves deep into the standard excellent cooling that a TUF Gaming card provides and makes sure that gamers are well equipped in case they want to adjust their cooling or performance characteristics.  \n\nThese cards sport the typical metal exoskeleton for structural rigidity that the TUF Gaming cards are known for. Wide vents on the aluminum backplate allow heat to exhaust into the main airflow channel of your chassis. It wouldn't be a TUF Gaming card if it didn't include military-grade components for solid power delivery and long lifespan, or a PCB coating to protect it against short-circuits caused by moisture, dust, or debris.  \n\nTUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 cards feature: \n\n* 3.125-slot design with a vented exoskeleton and massive fin array optimized for airflow from three Axial-tech fans \n* Three eleven-blade Axial-tech fans maintain a steady high-pressure stream of cooling through a massive airflow-optimized fin array.  \n* Dual-ball fan bearings last up to twice as long as conventional sleeve-bearing designs. \n* 0dB technology allows the fans to turn off at low workloads and effectively become silent. \n* Dual BIOS switch to toggle between Performance and Quiet BIOS profiles. \n* ASUS GPU Guard and bracket secure the GPU, reducing the risk of cracks and ensuring stable mounting \n* Subtle RGB lighting on the TUF Gaming logo on the corner of the card can be configured through Aura Sync \n* GPU Tweak III software is free to monitor and configure your graphics card. The software now integrates the HW Info plug-in so you can keep an eye on your graphics card and just about anything else in your system. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bl4k27m3nvle1.jpg?width=7344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d3dabfa8757cbdf56a0956b720844daa9aae3c0\n\n**Pricing and Availability -** \n\nPricing – \n\n* TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition 16GB GDDR6 - $799.99\n* TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition 16GB GDDR6 - $709.99\n\nAvailability – On-Shelf March 6 at 6AM PT \n\nProduct Page -  \n\n* TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition 16GB GDDR6 - [https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070xt-o16g-gaming/](https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070xt-o16g-gaming/) \n* TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition 16GB GDDR6 - [https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070-o16g-gaming/](https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070-o16g-gaming/) \n\n**ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition and Prime Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl3o6xsmnvle1.jpg?width=7667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a22553134cc5d2da72fe23dcaf8c3c3da05ef4ee\n\nASUS Prime graphics cards were a new addition to our lineup last year. Packing performance and cooling into a compact 2.5 slot frame, these cards help ensure compatibility with more cases. Building a card this size that can handle the demands of long hours of gaming requires attention to a number of important details. \n\nTo make sure they offer excellent cooling performance compatible with a number of compact cases, Prime series cards use three Axial-tech fans, similar to the fans we use on our top-end graphics cards - but use a smaller fan hub that allows for longer fan blades. We then surround the fans in a barrier ring to increase downward pressure. The card also features: \n\n* Dual-ball fan bearings last up to twice as long as conventional sleeve-bearing designs. \n* 0dB technology to turn the fans off below 50C, and turn the fans back on at 55C with a speed curve optimized for cooling and noise. \n* Phase-change GPU thermal pads for optimal heat transfer and long-term reliability. \n* 2.5-slot design allows for greater build compatibility while maintaining cooling performance \n* Dual-BIOS switch that allows you to switch fan profiles between Performance and Quiet BIOS profiles. \n* Aluminum protective backplate to protect the card and provide structural integrity \n* GPU Tweak III software is free to monitor and configure your graphics card. The software now integrates the HW Info plug-in so you can keep an eye on your graphics card and just about anything else in your system. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qm8x0o43ovle1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3638dcb9517bb2e28579474545c0b38d415acbe\n\n**Pricing and Availability -** \n\nPricing – \n\n* ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition - $719.99\n* ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition - $659.99\n\nAvailability – On-Shelf March 6 at 6AM PT \n\nProduct Page -  \n\n* ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition - [https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9070xt-o16g/](https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9070xt-o16g/) \n* ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition - [https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9070-o16g/](https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9070-o16g/) \n\nFAQ - \n\nQ. Will there be other models than TUF Gaming and Prime?  \nA. No plans to offer additional models at this time.\n\nQ. Where will we be able to purchase these cards?  \nA. Although we don’t yet have final confirmation of Day 1 availability, these are the locations that are expected to have the cards:  \n\n* US – Amazon, Newegg, Microcenter, ASUS eShop, Central Computer \n* CA – Canada Computers, Best Buy (CA) \n\nThis is what we can share for now, as we'll update pricing and availability when they become available.

      "Has any economist done a writeup on the discrete GPU market? \n\nit's wild how expensive the top of the market has gotten while the bottom of the market has virtually disappeared.\n\nBy all accounts most consumers still appear to be price conscious, but prices keep running away even while there is more competition than ever.",
      "This is what happens when manufacturers finds out people will pay whatever for something. The prices most likely will go up even more and people will still buy ALL GPUs.",
      "They are literally all doing it, because in the US… TARIFFS! And then they use that as an excuse to charge everyone high prices",
      "Bought an asrock steel legend cause that’s all microcenter had in stock at msrp by the time I got in. It’s such a good card. I was pleasantly surprised.",
      "HDMI was a mistake. I wish we had replaced it with DP a long time ago. At least it's caught up enough in bandwidth now though that they're both mostly interchangeable.",
      "Yeah. Why would your GPU need iCue?",
      "> iCue doesn't have integration for either of those. Or for AMD in general.\n\nOkay and?",
      "Well, as annoying as this may seem. From a business standpoint. If their inventory sells out completely with each wave they release. Why would they not? \n\nI'm just playing devils advocate here. If their focus is making profit. Then why would they not do this?",
      "And of course, the real reason is because $700+ for a 9070 and $800+ for a 9070 XT is still gonna be sold out for months.\n\nThe biggest issue is that B100 is sold out through 2025 and beyond and it uses the same die space/node process (IIRC) as a 5090.\n\nShort of Nvidia or AMD releasing some kind of 3nm refresh of their cards this year that doesn't ALSO slam into a different datacenter AI card (or a metric truckload of Apple orders), I'm not sure we have a good solution for this problem. Everyone is fighting for the same die space and one use case has 10-30x the retail value as the others.",
      "I think its because for as much as they can make on the low end, the high end is where the biggest profit margins are. For every $2000 card they sell it probably brings in more money than 10 $400 cards do. And since scalpers will always buy stuff up to resell for more, they dont care. I think eventually this won't be able to be sustained, and we will see a considerable readjustment. But while the money is flowing, they will keep selling at these huge prices."

      "The GRE nomenclature feels like a weird meme that AMD hasn't quite realized is played-out.",
      "This product doesn't make sense. The 9xxx series is selling just fine as it is. Or is this just a tactic to break into the Chinese market, which is far more intertwined with Nvidia than the rest of the world? \n\nIt doesn’t make sense either; Nvidia isn’t supplying enough stock, and AMD would sell out just as easily there.",
      "I assume that, at some point, the market will be saturated with the Radeon RX 9070/9070 XT.\n\nAMD can then sell the Radeon RX 9070 GRE as the cheaper equivalent to the GeForce RTX 5070.",
      "Should be Golden Snake Edition for 2025!",
      "> 12 GB up against 5060 Ti 16 GB will be a joke.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 5070 also has 12 GB VRAM.",
      "The way the world is going, this is a very distant future.",
      "Is there enough room between a 9060 xt and a 9070 for another product?  there's not pricing space in-between the 9070 and 9070 xt.\n\nWould this just be navi 48 dies that didn't make the cut as 9070 vanillas?  That would say pretty bad things about AMD's yield.",
      "I mean, the 7900GRE got a lot of mindshare, it makes sense for them to keep the name",
      "It's about cutting down the memory controller too when damaged.  Those defective dies get to be reused and return a profit instead of thrown away into into the silicon recycling bin.  This has been done with so many generations now I don't understand how you think this is anything new.",
      "Instead however AMD changed it to mean \"Great Radeon Edition\" Instead, no joke, that's what they did to justify keeping GRE naming.",
      "Since AMD typically offers a 20% discount to NVIDIA, and the GeForce RTX 5070 is priced at $549, I estimate that the Radeon RX 9070 GRE will be approximately $439 (if AMD decides to release it).\n﻿\n﻿This is, of course, excluding tariffs.",
      "I don't think it's as far as people fear. The Micro Center closest to me (3+ hours away) went through all of its hundreds of 9070 cards at launch. There was one model that restocked about half a dozen units a couple of weeks ago, and they lasted at least a few hours.\n\nThis week, XFX restocked a couple of their models, which are all unbelievably overpriced (starts at $830). The 6 cards they got in ($850 Swifts in white) didn't even sell out. 5 of them moved that first day. The next day, the site listed that last Swift and 1 Quicksilver ($890, also in white) in stock. Those TWO cards lasted most of the day.\n\nIt's clear that the demand for these overpriced models has already diminished notably. Even some of the $700-750 models aren't disappearing from online restocks immediately, and there are some of those crappy Newegg bundles that last 1-2 days.",
      "But apparently it's the Wood/Green Snake year, not Metal or Earth element years.",
      "There's gonna be a massive gap in AMD's lineup between the 9070 and 9060 XT, price-wise. This would help fill it.",
      "The supply of 9070 is apparently low due to good 9070 XT yields, so what's the point of this card? 12 GB up against 5060 Ti 16 GB will be a joke.",
      "In my country, 9070 XT cheapest is 962€ and 5070 Ti cheapest is 1003€. 5070 Ti makes more sense in my country and people are buying 5070 Ti over 9070 XT considering the price difference. Don’t think a single 9070 XT has been sold so far and stock is there. 3 of my friends so far bought 5070 Ti over 9070 XT.",
      "Is that because of the name or because it just happened to be a good value sku?",
      "This generation is likely to last two years.\n\nDemands for the Radeon RX 9070/9070 XT will likely be met by then.",
      "The irony of saying someone's dishonest for giving a piece of information, while providing no additional information whatsoever, is so preposterously stupid that I don't even know how to take it seriously.\n\nAll you said was it's foolish to cite Micro Center, then call it dishonest when I add Best Buy and Newegg...all while saying nothing yourself. I'm thinking maybe you're the dishonest one and just being a pedantic contrarian because it's the only way you can find anything to say.",
      "They're great cards at $600 but I'd pick a 5070ti if it's within $100 of the 9070XT.  A case can be made for the $700-$750 models but I don't think the $800+ models make sense."
