      "Yeah unfortunately my 8700k won't get this. Sad day when there's not enough reason to upgrade to new gen cpu yet",
      "This will be great in like 5 years when I upgrade my cpu/mobo...",
      "Agreed. 8700k is in such a weird spot right now. It's hard to justify a CPU upgrade, and it's even harder to justify if you play on 1440P.\n\nBut it is an up to 10%  performance increase..",
      "I think some 300 series boards are getting BAR support. Check for bios updates with it.",
      "thanks AMD",
      "Also running 8700k here, kinda jelly.\n\nWonder if the decision to not support 8th/9th gen was intentional to force an upgrade, or it required significant investment/resources. A little bit of both probably.",
      "Welllll we're waiting! For the other 3000 series cards",
      "Isn't the 3060 the only card that has a vbios that supports this right now for Intel chipsets?",
      "I don't know why you are being downvoted when what you said is true.  Innovation and competition are good.",
      "I hope so...I think I can use this with my 5600x?",
      "Resize BAR was added  3 bio files ago for Z490 Hero XII, 1002, 1003 & now Beta 2004, which shows \"improved resize BAR\".  Been running the first 2 bio files since December.",
      "I want this, too. 5600x & 2080ti here, BIOS already supports SAM.\n\nHowever, Nvidia will probably ~~take a dump~~ ignore their \"old\" customers.",
      "Test system is using a Ryzen 5900x on a X570 motherboard and EVGA RTX3060 with the latest drivers",
      "Hope it's the same performance increase on a 3080!",
      "Does anyone knows if RTX 2000 series is going to receive support eventually?",
      "Resizeable BAR basically allows the CPU to more efficiently transfer larger chunks of Data to the GPUs memory, instead of having to use tons of smaller chunks.\n\n  \n\n\nWhich allows more data to be quickly moved to the GPU, meaning less waiting around -> performance increase.\n\n  \n\n\nNot all games see a large performance increase, some see none at all. But, as shown it can be up to 15% performance increase for free.",
      "I am pretty excited about direct storage as well, it's one of the reasons I went with a gen4 nvme and 5800x (plus getting the bar stuff as well)",
      "If it makes you feel any better, my 10900K and Z490 Hero XII also doesnt support ReBar.  \n\n\nOnly in a Beta Bios that causes constant crashes, overvolting and shut downs.",
      "Is there some type of limitation with the riser? Cause it's not exclusive to Gen4.",
      "I'm in the same boat, got the 5600x, the bios update with SAM enabled and a 2070 Super. Crossing fingers."

    "selftext": " Anyone has experience with 3050Ti and Nvidia RTX3060? Last one is much better I know, but im gonna buy a laptop, and Im not sure which one: the laptop using a Nvidia 3050TI has a I712700H processor, and the laptop with Nvidia 3060 has a I511400H. The difference talkinga bout price is 100$.  \nDo you think the aptop with 3050 can be better with games just because the processor is much better?we re talking about a I712700H....   \nThoughs? thanks!!",

      "I would go with the 3060.\n\nThe CPU only really matters if it is a terrible CPU (neither of these are terrible), or your GPU is ridiculously fast and your CPU is slow (neither GPU is ridiculously fast).",
      "for games, always go for the best gpu \n\n3060 >",
      "No way on 3050. Only 4GB VRAM there. I literally had a 4gb VRAM 960m on a much older laptop - so why 4GB cards are still a thing for modern GPU's, I'll never know. \\[shrug\\]\n\nFor $100 extra, get the 6GB VRAM 3060 with more VRAM and more performance. CPU ain't everything, when it comes to games. GPU matters A LOT.",
      "I wrote out a long comment with how usually a laptop's CPU is more important because laptop GPUs are almost always throttled either by power limits or thermal limits, but I didn't realize how big [the gap between a mobile 3060 and 3050 Ti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkgeTZpzY) was.\n\n100% go with the 3060 laptop even though it has an older CPU.",
      "As someone owning a RTX 3070 desktop - this is true for me on some games. Namely RE2 Remake, RE3 Remake, and WD: Legion. All of these - 8GB VRAM is not enough. I'd probably need 10-12GB, to max those out.",
      "6GB 3060 > 4GB 3050ti \n\nUnreal Engine 5.0 Matrix City already complains about low VRAM on 6GB 3060 so you have to enable upscaling.  Can't imagine running it with only 4GB.  Nvidia need to give their GPUs more VRAM to compete with AMD.",
      "Don't listen to anyone here, laptops we are talking about, there are too many factors. Heating, battery life, screen, keyboard, touchpad, weight, design.. it goes on. I'd recommend carefully checking as many reviews as possible for the models, and decide for your needs.",
      "We're discussing laptop so mobile 3060 and not desktop 3060.",
      "Technically correct, but not a practical or cost effective solution since most egpus enclosures will cost you nearly as much, with the cost of the new GPU, as a whole new gaming laptop.",
      "Why do you get downvoted? I have 8.3 GB VRAM load on AC Odyssey.\n\nThat’s 4 years old now.",
      "GPU wins over CPU on this occasion.",
      "Some laptops support egpu via thunderbolt 4. So yes, GPU can be upgraded.",
      "Keep in mind - on consoles, you're likely on a huge HDTV and in a sense, you need the 4K pixels b/c you're on much bigger & huger display at 40-70+ inches for the pixel-ratio to make sense (so there isn't aliasing and no blur). Bigger the TV, higher the res' needed technically - as you need to hit the proper pixel aspect ratio. Plus, more console players likely sit further away and on a couch of sorts, so your field of view is MUCH different - as you might not notice all of the pixels, since you're sitting further away.\n\nOn a PC, you're likely right up on that monitor and VERY close to it - so, you'll likely notice stuff if it ain't AA'd and/or runs at a lower resolution (i.e. below 1080p), depending on the size of your monitor. On PC we are probably in the 15.6'' inch (laptop) to 30-something on a monitor (some might go for on PC) at 1080p or 1440p. Sure, some on PC might use big HDTV's - but that ain't the best answer for PC performance. Also likely, PC players are on a high refresh-rate monitor and are going to aim for that. PC gamers who sit right smackdab in front of their monitor likely do NOT need 4K right now; it's too expensive and not ready for high framerates. They can do 1080p and/or 1440p w/ huge framerates and be happy with that - and still be able to toss RT on and maybe even max it out, provided you toss on DLSS or FSR...and crank that up.\n\nYou're likely not maxing-out games at their highest settings on any console; and/or not running it maxed-out at 60fps with RT On. Some games, they don't even often have the same settings, same textures on consoles as they do PC; they can't, since you're buying a $500 box...which likely is super under-priced and they sell the consoles as loss-leaders, as these companies (Microsoft and Sony) make the $ elsewhere to recoup it off their games, subscription services, MTX's, and/or other means.\n\nGo watch any video from Digital Foundry, who are often comparing often pixel-for-pixel, texture-for-texture, setting-for-setting the difference b/t PC and console versions of games and going into grave details - and yes, there's often some big differences on PC v. console for the same game. Same goes w/ performance too - as we can likely hit 60fps in RT titles all the with RT settings maxed-out, provided you spend the $ for the power of course.\n\nHeck, some games like Far Cry 6, they didn't even put RT on the console versions. Why? B/c it won't run well on that mid-range AMD hardware, that's why. And we all know how poorly optimized Ubi titles are anyways. PC version of FC6 has RT support though - and RT is a BIG difference in games, as its lighting is more realistic & more accurate.\n\nThese consoles do NOT have the power of RTX 3070's. They (XSX and PS5) sit more in the GTX 1660/RTX 2060 to 2070 range. RTX 2070 came out in Oct. 2018; it's old by now, a bit over 3 1/2 years ago. Likely when NVidia's 4000 and 5000 series come along, since consoles can't be upgraded and dev's will scream for more power again as tech on PC surpasses consoles again - especially by year 2-4 in a console's life - we'll again see PS5 Pro's and X Box Series X Pro versions, so both dev's and console-makers can have their cake & eat it too, in an Apple-like fashion. Consoles can only keep up w/ the bleeding technology that NVidia has going on for so long, as really the GPU's where a lot of the real power for gaming's at, these days & age. And NVidia knows this - and they charge an arm & leg for this power.\n\nThough, I really can't recall the last time I spent $40 for a game. Oh, I actually can - Witcher 2 PC version, pre-order; so that's probably around 2011. With Bundle Sites, discounted sales, games cutting prices so fast, Epic often offering coupons to make people buy games there, things like PC Game Pass when Microsoft has those cheap deals (i.e. $1 for 3 months), Steam Sales, etc etc - and I have this huge library on PC across all these platforms (Retail in boxes on discs; Steam; GOG; Epic; etc etc)....that never seems to die. And b/c of modders, dev's patching games, Windows being Windows, things like DGVoodoo and DXVK to get old games going, etc etc - my PC library I've been adding to since 1995 just keeps getting added to and many of these games I can get going on Windows 10.",
      "They are faster (possibly twice as fast) than thunderbolt and do not have to deal with the overhead that the thunderbolt controller brings. Depending on one’s system they may have upto 4 pcie gen 4 lanes which can be used for the m.2 to pcie adapter. Thunderbolt caps out at 4 gen 3 lanes, essentially half the bandwidth.",
      "What are your priorities?\nIf it's only games and you don't do that much cpu intensive tasks, then go with the 3060.\n\nOtherwise i'd say the core i7 is more future proof as it has more cores , newer , up to 25% faster than that i5(in windoes 11 with no other bottlenecks).\n\nYou are basically trading 20% gpu performance for 20% cpu performance here , it's you choice and usage that determines which is better for you.",
      "you don't need high end cpu for gaming. CPU bottleneck is not possible with modern CPUs. besides that for things like audio processing the cpu matters 99% so decide what you want.",
      "For higher resolution and lower framerates GPU is more important. For lower res higher fps CPU is more important. Also keep in mind GPU is way easier to upgrade than a CPU.\n\nFor that setup I'd say that i5 being 6c/12t is good enough and go 3060.",
      "That’s a 6 core cpu vs 14 core cpu. Depending on the laptop you may be able to hook up an egpu but you cannot do anything about the CPU. I’d go with the i7.",
      "https://pc-builds.com/bottleneck-calculator/",
      "Depends on what you're using your laptop for.\n\nPurely gaming? The 3060 laptop will be better.\n\nProductivity work? The i7 laptop will be much better.\n\nOfc, make sure to research and find reviews for each laptop. How good a laptop will be is far more than just CPU + GPU combo."

      "These cards are around 1000 USD in my country (so sick). I was \"lucky\" to get one at a retail shop for \\~700. Handed over to a friend who needs a vga, so we can play together. I'm good with the prev gen. haha\n\nps. \\*\\*\\*\\* the scalpers",
      "Whatever strange memory gamble Nvidia was trying seems to have compromised the value of the 3060.\n\nI imagine the went with a 192 bit bus in the hopes that they could release a 6gb card and save on both memory and the bus. Instead AMD has crammed 16gb into thier high end, and we'll likely see 8-12 across the rest of the range. That extra 6gb in the 3060 cant be cheap, I'm almost certain that a 256gb bus and 8gb config would have resulted in a slightly faster card that would likely be at least 30 dollars cheaper to produce, and a 3060 at 300 dollars would be much more appealing.\n\nNow if only it wasnt cut down from the 3840 core full die. We'd have 7% more cores (and likely 5 percent more performance) and in theory at 300 bucks it would be a better value offering than the 3060ti.\n\nWith the existing 3060 the 3060ti = 30% more performance for 21% more money. A 5% faster $300 3060 results in a 3060ti offering 24% more performance for 33% more money.",
      "The card doesn't matter if you cannot get one and that is exactly the situation. I can find nothing online and my local Micro Center got less than 40 units as they told me when 3060 launched.\n\nTherefore I am staying with my 1060.",
      "Nice summary. I feel the 3060 is almost great. Instead, it's just... meh. It doesn't do enough for the price.",
      "seems like it sits between the 2060Super and 2070Super and 5% faster than 1080TI. People kept saying its the same as the 2060Super but I'm glad its not the case. The actual retail prices are terrible right now, I'm in Canada and the cheapest 3060 is only 30 CAD lower than the 3060TI founders edition and most of the 3060 cost MORE than the 3060TI founder edition. But again, those are retail prices, I think once silicon is back in supply, the 3060 will actually sell at MSRP which is a good deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: 5% Slower than 1080TI...but still a good deal!",
      "During launch there were tons of comments on places like this saying it's comparable to a 1070 or 2060 or whatever. Glad things are finally getting cleared up.\n\nRegarding 1080Ti, the 3060 seems to be a bit slower. But the 3060 is also an ampere card with DLSS, resizable BAR, etc. that aren't factored in to cross-gen performance comparisons to make the tests more balanced",
      "Honestly its amazing the difference even 30 dollars make in the comparison.  With no other changers, at 300 bucks alone it would scale linearly with the 3060ti.\n\nTo put things in perspective, if it was $250 it would be absurdly good value (3060ti would offer 30 percent more performance for 60% more money)\n\nHell, at $280 it would be compared with the 1660ti which it is roughly 50% faster than.",
      "Lol. Yeah if you can’t beat ‘em join ‘em....selling a 3080 for $2200! That’s why people scalp....cuz you can make a lot of chedda.",
      "2060->3060 = 22% average performance gain, not including resizable BAR which gives the 3060 a 17% increase in games like battlefield 5 and will be more and more supported in the future.\n\n1060->2060 is missing context. The 6GB 1060 launched at $250 with a cheaper 3GB model, and the 2060 was $350 at launch.",
      "1000? So cheap!  \nWhere I live, they are selling them at 6000dls at minimun",
      "Ya the 3060TI is definitely the better deal but you gotta buy a bot to get it lol! I was able to backorder a 3060 at my local retailer in Canada but they wouldn't even let me backorder the other 30 series cards saying that they have no idea when they'd get stock.",
      "Oh don’t blame him one bit. I’d do the same thing. I don’t have a problem with any of it. The value of something isn’t it’s MSRP it’s what ever someone else is willing to pay for it. I bought a scalped 3080 the scalped price was still cheaper than what I was going to pay for a 2080ti. So more power to him.",
      "Is a shame that I will never be able to buy this card  \nThey are selling it like 6000dls here"

You can even oc the system(5600will draw about 105w with pbo+auto oc) but be careful with gpu oc and monitor power draw.

Theoretically it's enough, but I'm not sure if it's safe.\n Do you guys think I should replace this PSU and get another one with 2 pci-e cables? If so, 550W is enough?",

      "You should be fine... the Daisy chain is really designed for a 2 6-pin GPU (75W +75W) which means 150 Watts for the single cable. The 3060 ti is a 200 Watt GPU... so with the 75 Watts that the PCI-e slot provides plus the 150W from the cable... you can handle 225W safely.",
      "750 is overkill. A high-quality 550 will do the job. Emphasis on high-quality.\n\nI highly doubt he will need more than 550W on an average CPU for the 3060ti. Might need more if he's rocking a bigger cpu.\n\nIf he plans to upgrade his cpu to smth bigger, then yeah get 650W or smth. 750W is still overkill for this build.",

Some games are going to be that demanding enough in that timeframe even without RT to run perf down or needing DLSS to bring it back up, which is common to all Ampere cards depending on resolution and personal expectation etc. \n\nJust thinking how my old 1070 (from 2016 to 2021) went from a 60+ fps ultra card (in AAA examples) at 1440p to 60 fps high at 2560x1080 to struggling to get 60 fps and high settings at 1080p over 5 years. \n\nA 3070ti and up may well be overkill in some cases, especially at 1080p rn (indeed, even in my gf's PC at 3440x1440 a 3070 non-ti holds up well rn) so it'd be worth more run higher than 1080p 60Hz for now BUT by the end of this new gen it'll be running down like that stalwart 1070 did. So imo it's either that for as much of 5 years as will suffice OR buy a slightly lower card now (probably a 3060ti for the RT) and upgrade again well before that 5 year mark."

I replaced all the vram chips with correct ones (the same ones found on a AMD RX6800 or RX6800XT)\n\nThat's why it works.\n\nThe vBIOS for this card has like 4 different configurations in there three different 8GB memory chips from three different brands, and a 4th configuration with 16GB memory chips.\n\nThis mod uses that, I didn't edit the BIOS. The only thing I'm doing afterwards is forcing highest powerstate in the Nvidia driver, because the new memory ics don't like the low idle frequency of the older ones :( .\n\nOh and I OC them because they actually support 16Gbps instead of 14Gbps but that is optional.",
      "Can the card actually make use of the 16GB?\n\nI remember seeing a similar mod before but because the vBIOS was the same, even though GPUZ could see the extra VRAM, any program that requested VRAM above the stock limit would cause the card to not function or crash.",

      "The main market would be to do it on 3090/4090, otherwise people can just buy those to get 24GB instead of 8-12.",
      "Hi, here are a few more infos:\n\nThis is no new mod, people have been doing [it before](https://videocardz.com/newz/modder-puts-16gb-memory-on-geforce-rtx-3070-and-it-works) (also two brazilian ones [here](https://youtu.be/W6uaUHBNFOU?si=vi7kGx53dshhMMWy) and [here](https://youtu.be/9-db-d5AjgI?si=GjDg_ldC18hisnhZ) who actually do a real professional job).\n\nThe card itself cost me like 330€ (314€ without the extra memory chips) in total and I even have like 3 memory modules left over if one of them fails (hopefully not).\n\nDue to my lack of really professional tools I may have overheated the modules a tiny bit and am still in the worry phase (like most defects of thermal shock, cracking solder etc. from too much heat the may happen a few weeks afterwards). That is why I still haven't sold my 3060 ti. The whole process took me like 8 nerve wrecking hours.\n\nThe switch itself works. The whole mod itself works because most Nvidia BIOSes for the 3070, 3060 ti actually support 16GB VRAM, the switch itself changes the configuration between the two of them on startup. So I have to turn off the PC so that the card has no power at all, flip it, and then start it up. Tbh I will only really use 8GB mode when I detect an error.\n\nBad stuff:\n\nSadly the low power state is a bit broken and that's why I have to force maximum performance on the card, which means an idle consumption of 50 Watts instead of 25Watts, I may edit the BIOS when Editors for that appear (there were rumors of people actually breaking the bios lock on 3000 series cards).\n\nGood stuff:\n\nA bonus is that the 16GB memory ICs themselves are actually faster than the original ones. 16Gbps instead of 14Gbps, I can even OC them to achieve even faster speeds.\n\nTh different speeds do make a difference in FPS, like 5\\~10% more on average. I wanted to have a 16GB Nvidia GPU for a long time, to try out a few more AI tools and play VR games with a higher texture resolutions.\n\nWhen I started half life alyx afterwards the game itself consumed like 10GB to nearly 16GB of VRAM. It did fluctuate so I assume this isn't just allocated but actually used VRAM.\n\nOCCT and some scripts that loaded some AI models into VRAM where also able to access the 16GB without a problem.\n\nEnd:\n\nJust wanted to share it, I originally planned on buying a 4080 but couldn't justify the price. The 4070 with only 12GB feels like a crime for 600€ and the 4060 ti while faster than the 3070 in theoretical performance still costs like 480\\~550€.\n\nI still feel bad for the 330€ spent on the 3070, lol. Though it's less bad now that it has more vram.",
      "So you basically got a 4060 Ti 16gb for 330 instead of 450. Nice\n\n(Minus power efficiency and frame gen)",
      "You can't do it to a 4090 or a 3090ti because they already use the 2GB VRAM modules you need to upgrade to. Only the base 3090 can be increased to 48GB",
      "he wouldn't with the amount of flux I used, like 3/4 of a new tube. Even with all the alcohol I used to clean this I still smell pinecones whenever my PC starts up.\n\nAlso I didn't had proper tools so I may have used a bit too much heat :(",
      "I saw this mod in a youtube video and gave it a go myself.\n\nHere is an article about the first guy who tried it in 2020:[https://videocardz.com/newz/modder-puts-16gb-memory-on-geforce-rtx-3070-and-it-works](https://videocardz.com/newz/modder-puts-16gb-memory-on-geforce-rtx-3070-and-it-works)\n\nIn the second video he even shows the table that shows the configurations: [https://youtu.be/wh5EeJKUYjk?si=LPNxpK2rutRKh\\_Yz&t=72](https://youtu.be/wh5EeJKUYjk?si=LPNxpK2rutRKh_Yz&t=72)\n\nThe first guy did this thing \"blind\" I think which is even more impressive, he found out about the existance of the table, after he installed the new memory ICs. At least that what it sounds like because in the video he noticed that he used the wrong/slower memory chips.\n\nAnd here is a video of some brazilian guys doing the mod 4 month ago, though a lot more professionally with the correct tools compared to me: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6uaUHBNFOU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6uaUHBNFOU)  \n\n\nThey were the ones that implemented the switch to change between 8 or 16GB. I just copied their work :-)\n\nI mostly used their videos as basis for all this, I also searched for a schematic for my gpu, but couldn't find one and tried to approximate from others. :(",
      "yeah, tough 4060 ti with 16gb go for like 500€\\~550€ here.\n\nThe 4060 ti is actually theoretically faster, but when looking at FPS performance it's a a small bit behind the 3070.\n\nOh and this uses a lot more power than the 4060 ti and no frame gen, and obviously no warranty.  \n\n\nBut I generally only play at like 60hz to 75hz @ 1080p and frame gen is currently useless for VR (where delay is important and that type of gaming is my only \"4K\" high load gaming).",
      "GPU Scores:\n\n(8GB Stock Mem: 1750Mhz ): 13 350\n\n(16GB Stock Mem: 2000Mhz ): 13 700\n\n(16GB  OC Mem: 2150Mhz):  13 845\n\nJust the memory boost itself gives like 2% or 3% better performance.\n\n(16GB  OC Mem: 2150Mhz, Core: +100Mhz and 110% powerlimit): 14 470\n\nIt's nothing impressive.  \nI think with the stock memory, you can also OC it close to the 2000Mhz mark, atleast the samsung ones. The installed 16GB memory is rated for 2000Mhz so OCing them to 2000Mhz isn't really an OC and just setting them to stock, 2150Mhz was also stable.",
      "Krisfix would be proud!",
      "I would because a RTX 3090 is literally 1/5 the price of a RTX A6000 48GB. If the process kills a 3090 I still have 4 more tries lol.",

      "Can't unfortunately. The bus width would allow 4, 8, or 16gb with current dram.",
      "You should put 24gb of vram on a 1650ti next",
      "First of, congratulations! That's a pretty neat mod, considering that you can use the full 16 GB.\n\n>The vBIOS for this card has like 4 different configurations in there 3 8GB memory chips from three different brands, and a 4th configuration with 16GB memory chips.\n\nHow did you find out about this? Read it on a forum? Or did you check it yourself with some handy bios dumper that is able to find multiple configurations in a bios image?"

You have a special GPU so here's some tips from my experience: (mine ran hot and the fan was loud, to remedy this I tried a few things)\n- replacing the TIM only gained me a degree or so at load, aka not worth voiding warranty\n- deshrouding was a huge success, replacing the stock fans with 2x 120mm 1700rpm Redux fans connected through a gpu fan y-adapter (gpu still controls the fans). With the new fans, they are much more durable and quiet, so I keep them at minimum 40% which greatly reduces idle temps and helps mem OCs.\n- the special 'OC1' version you have is basically a 3070 pcb and cooler with a GA-104 (I think, 3060 Ti) chip. You can easily flash the gaming x trio bios to make the card a lot faster at stock, but also unlock the power limit. It's definitely worth doing.",

      "Do NOT fuck up the flash if you do flash another bios. This card does not have dual bios, so if you do fuck up, unless you have integrated graphics on your CPU and even then, your mobo has to support it (looking at you high end z490 mobos!) , you will NOT be able to unflash your now expensive brick, and you void your warranty if you do RMA it with a bios that is not stock to your card. Most people that just tell people to flash a different bios forget to mention that, and when they mess up and their card black screens, it's shit out of luck. Again, do you want you want, but you have to be upfront and tell them that you can't simply click a switch on your GPU if one bios flash fails and have it boot. If you mess up, it's done.\n\nDeshrouding is definitely a good mod though. The fans that come with the card (especially the 2x) if replaced with nice noctuas can see some cooler temps for sure. I use it in one of my SFF cases.\n\nUndervolting is the way to go on these ventus cards. Albeit, mine is a 3080, so it could be different between cards.\n\nYou can try undervolting for the same performance, less heat if you would like to give it a shot.

It’s just mid range cards nowadays are really powerful and they’re more than enough to play at 1080p at max graphical settings and medium rtx settings.

I sadly don't have screenshots anymore, but you can easily look on YT for benchmarks on this game (I have an RTX 2060 and a Ryzen 3600) where people with my setup for example use like 12-13 GB and surely they made sure to use as little background tools as possible for benchmarking reasons.\n\nSo I don't know where you got your numbers from for the 10 Gigs max at 4k(?) but they are not true at all."

      "tbh EVGA doesnt get as much attention as other companies that do the same stuff",
      "I think it's because EVGA focuses more on it's North American market. Most Gpu's are made in Taiwan (even EVGA's) but I think EVGA mainly runs in NA and companies like MSI, Gigabyte, and Zotac may have more reviews due to international availability. I hear a lot that EVGA's aren't as available to people outside of NA.",
      "This is why I like EVGA too, they also have a step up program. Everything they do just seems like they care more than other brands.",
      "So I initially bought this GPU as a place holder for the 3060ti version of the same card for my Mini-itx build. Tbh I wasn't as dissappointed as I thought I'd be initially. At first glance the card looks really clean and doesn't look like it uses cheap parts. Installation was easy due to only one 8-pin connector. I also really like the metal backplate, as it covers everything!\n\nNow let's get down to performance:\nThe first thing I did with this card was test the temps and noise at stock levels while playing a little Valorant on high settings. First off, idle temps were sitting 29-34C on a hot day. After about an hour of gaming it got to about 73C at the hottest. Fans are super quiet on stock settings.\n\nThe next thing I wanted to test was ofc it's OC capabilities. Granted every card (even the same card) will have different OC values. I use MSI afterburner and Kombustor to OC and stress test. So for me, I was able keep a stable core clock at 200mhz and changed the memory clock to 400mhz higher than the factory OC. Also I adjusted the fan speeds in Afterburner to 60 and 75 and I never got temps above 70C after that, but fans were a bit louder. (I've heard people complain about fan noise, but I think they're still pretty quiet under load.) I also have a video of the GPU fans on 75% fan speed. Feel free to dm me if you want to hear it for yourself.\n\nOverall, I'd say this card leaves a little more to be desired (esp for me since I'm in animation/design) but it's definitely more than enough for 1080p gaming, still a good choice for 1440p, and good enough to hold me off until I get the 3060ti xc I've been waiting so patiently for. Also after a few comments and testing a bit more today, it can barely hold 4K @ 30-50 fps with adjusting some settings (This is after a week and a half of testing)",
      "They're also about the only company that still lets a card keep it's warranty if you take it apart to watercool it. They also honor the warranty 2nd hand, such as if you buy a card from someone or on Ebay.",
      "I’ve bought EVGA as my main brand for many years in the UK, not sure where you heard that. It’s just as common as any brand here, in fact I just swapped out my EVGA 3080 FTW3 Ultra as I got a 3090 Strix",
      "sorry changed \"solid\" to \"decent\" 4k experience, fps is kinda low but very much playable 30-50's depending on the game. My average fps on 1080p was about 150-280 (150's for Destiny 2 and 200-280's for Valorant)",
      "also in Europe, here in Romania EVGA cards are extremely hard to find, and they were usually scalped even before the 3000 series launch. FE cards too.",
      "I had a issue with a evga psu and they helped me out and replaced it with 0 hassle. Now i just use evga PSUs.",
      "evgas are probably superior",
      "I def think EVGA has their stuff together as a whole. When it comes to their customer service and product design, I would usually go for EVGA since I live in US. People do like MSI for their Overclock capabilites, but customer service is hit or miss. Asus has been tuf this year tho! lol Also, I hear Asus' customer service is pretty decent too. Another thing is diff companies have better warrantys in the countries they operate out of usually.",
      "I meant in places where they are actually built like Taiwan and Asia (where most Gpu companies operate) Evga isn't as available to them and warranties for other brands are usually better.",
      "Nice build.\n\nTotal fine on AIO.\n\ndon't bother with the GN cultist people.",
      "3060 can do 4K?",
      "I was about to say something about Mew and airflow obstruction of the GPU, but it doesn't really have any to boot.",
      "No problem, I was genuinely curious. Seems like good value if people can get it!",
      "I, on the other hand, replaced my 3080 XC3 with an Aorus because of the misleading marketing that XC3 Ultra had ARGB lighting, yet their software didn't allow ARGB effects for that card. The issue was confirmed by EVGA's Jacob after my post gained attention and after he ignored my questions about it several times before I made the post. I don't know if newer versions of the software fixed the issue or not.",
      "Even still with a 3080 i'm not getting locked 60fps with the settings up on many games. Red Dead and Cyberpunk for instance werent close. Im sure there's tons of differing experiences here but I've been going 1440p ultrawide for a while and that seems like the sweet spot.",
      "Clean build, love the lighting"

On a match I had brought it down to medium like on my 3060 it went down to 32 fps and stayed there until i changed it to high or ultra (I don’t remember which) and it went up to 60-70fps. \nI got a i5 12600kf but it doesnt go over 60%\n\n[Update]\n\nSeems like Nvidia’s app new recommended settings for all my games is 4k ultra. Yeah looks great but at the cost of fps and high gpu and v ram usage. Tuned it to 1440p high native and it runs decently. 80-100 fps with 80-90% usage for both gpu and v ram. Thoughts?

      "So I could potentially sell my 3070 in the future for $950 to a miner and buy a non-mining 3070 for MSRP and not feel shame? Make it so.",
      "> On Twitter, Bryan Del Rizzo (Director of global PR for GeForce) confirmed that the anti-crypto technology works as a secure handshake between the driver, the GPU silicon, and BIOS. The latter confirms that this is indeed a BIOS implementation and explains how RTX 3060 in a very early test was already seeing the limited performance. The technology simply does not need a driver to work.\n\n> What is particularly interesting here is that according to the tweets, NVIDIA would relaunch its existing SKUs under a new Device ID. This means that future RTX3090/3080/3070/3060Ti models would carry a different ID and feature the anti-crypto algorithm. It is unclear when and if NVIDIA will even announce this change",
      "If Nvidia is saying all this, I'm guessing they must really not be happy with Zotac. lol",
      "Unpopular opinion: Limiting performance of a piece of hardware is never a good idea even if it is proposed in a good faith (fighting against miners in this case).\n\nI think it is widely adopted that Apple throttling performance for longer battery life is a bad idea no matter how good faith it is. Praising a company for limiting performance in some good faith may open up more power for them to take more extreme measure. I, for one, can see limiting ML performance being a measure to give more cards to gamers that at least makes some sense. How about limiting general purpose CUDA performance when detecting scientific computing?",
      "That’s very clever. So if a miner buys a gpu he doesn’t know if it’s old or locked. They will need to buy used ones which dont even exist. Fuck yeah only nvidia greed is stronger than mining greed. Who though the evil would hav a good side XD",
      "Expand to more SKUs? already existing SKUs? Does that mean my 3090 will go up even more in value? xD",
      "You mean like how they already limit functionality to make people buy quadro?",
      "Yeah, can I scalp my 3060Ti to a miner and then get a 3070 or 3080 too?",
      "Because they want to sell dedicated mining cards and don't want to be sitting on loads of unsold stock when all those mining cards end up being resold.",
      "Hopefully all new gaming cards will have this tech, so this utter mining bullshit will die.",
      "If all future RTX cards incorporate this new Mining Limiter, then older RTX cards without this would become more desirable for miners, as they'd be able to mine a lot better.",
      "They already do this shit to force people to buy quadro dude. This isn’t new.",
      "If I pay 1500$ for a GPU, I expect to be able to do whatever the fuck I want to with it. I get that miners drive up the cost, but this can be fixed by other means like buyer verification so that large numbers of GPUs cannot be purchased simultaneously. How is this any different than Apple limiting their battery capacity via software on older iPhones?",
      "> This is a horrible trend to start by nVIDIA.\n\nThis is what they've been doing to professional application users for decades with the GeFroce/Quadro driver divide. Same GPUs, 5-10x the price for a driver that doesn't artificially cripple your performance. I'm not saying it's right, but it's hardly a new trend, and I'm not going to shed any tears for people who are wasting entire countries' worth of electricity mostly to facilitate money laundering and tax evasion.",

      "I actually really hate this. I don't like companies saying what I can or can't run on technology that I purchased. You know there are also people who game and then mine in their non-gaming time right? This seems only to be  a way for nvidia to sell more cards",
      "Just do it, add it to the rtx 3070 3080 and 3090 im tired of waiting.",
      "You’re delusional if you think this is a PR move. Nvidia is going to be doing this to every single new card and even releasing new skus of all the existing cards. Mining is going to be dead on GTX cards. This isn’t a PR move. If you want to mine with Nvidia cards you’re going to have to buy CMP."

You need glasses to drive or see things in HD that are more than 20m away. But it can also be linked to genetically poor eye sight. Some kid might look at a phone or tablet or computer from 4 years to 8 years and be fine. Others may develop poor long distance eye sight and require glasses for the aforementioned things like driving or having visual clarity for things more than 20m away.\n\nExample. I had perfect eye sight till about 25.  Played Vidya games since I was 9. Am now 33. I require glasses to see clearly at things that are far away. Basically driving only or if I want \"HD\" vision outside. My sunglasses are prescription so I basically always wear them anyway except inside. \n\nWould I still require glasses if I didn't stare at screen so much? Maybe. \n\nAnyway. It's not the screen that does anything really. It's just ur eyes getting used to looking at things at a certain distance all the time. Staring at wall that's 3ft away for 8 hours a day would do the same thing. \n\nSo yeh. Remember to look out the window sometimes if you have that luxury. Anyway you can just get glasses to fix these kinds of dumb human problems now anyway.

I'd go for the bigger monitor and higher resolution, but it you're all about that ultra high FPS then rock the 1080",
      "Wow, some people in here really drinking the NVIDIA koolaid. Looks like all the marketing insisting you need an 80 or 90 class card is working.\n\nA 3060ti performs roughly on-par with current-gen console GPUs, which target 1440-2160p. That's what games will be designed for, so you'll be set for years to come. It also crosses a threshold where basically all 8th-gen games can run at 4K60.\n\nThe only thing I really wish it had is more VRAM. 8GB just isn't enough to get the full power out of the GPU, and that's a shame. But you'll definitely be fine until an equivalent GPU with more VRAM hits the market at a reasonable price.",
      "Since this thread is full of trolls I’d like to put my 2 cents in and say the 3060ti is one of the best cards on the market for 1440p but don’t expect to max out settings in every game. I’ve owned a 3060ti and it’s actually a beast idk why people are trying to shit on it. I now own a 3080 and still use dlss which the 3060ti has to rely on more to max out a 1440p 165hz monitor. Overall the 3080 is not much better than the 3060ti. Make no mistake in limiting yourself to 1440p 60hz unless that’s what you already own. Nvidia drivers this generation have had some issues though in games that have amd optimization so beware of the games you choose to play before you buy.",
      "I don’t think anyone is reading the post lol they assume 1440p ultra ray tracing etc etc",
      "Assuming you mean 1440p at max settings then no, absolutely not. If you're fine with decreasing settings over the years as games get more intensive, then yes it's absolutely a viable card for the next 4 to 5 years at 1440p.  Hell probably even longer. And don't listen to these people talking about getting over 60 fps with Ray Tracing at 1440p with the 3060Ti using DLSS.  The statement may be true but they are definitely setting dlss to performance which is not worth it.  Honestly anything more than balanced and you're getting negative returns  You might as well play at 1080p with like dlss ultra at that point cuz it'll look much clearer.",
      "Agreed. I'm surprised at how many titles I can run at 1440p 60 on my 1660 Super lol so many people said I'd only be able to do \"1080p at high/ ultra\" 🤷‍♂️",
      "Depends on how willing you are to lower settings and how susceptible you are to teh quality differences between various DLSS modes and native.",
      "I have a 3070 and use dlss every time.  Even if I could somewhat tell it looks worse every now and then (which I can't unless I choose dlss performance) then I still prefer the extra performance.  I either want more fps or to up the res.",
      "Makes you wonder how many of them actually get that kind of performance. Seems like everybody just assumes it's straight forward like on console...",
      "Yeah people are looking at blurry upscaling and saying 1440p max. It’s just not true. My 3080 couldn’t do Guardians of the Galaxy at 1440p120 native very high (No RT) - without frequent jarring drops that GSync couldn’t overcome. 100 fps mostly worked.",
      ">Are you saying the 3060Ti can do 4k60??\n\n[It absolutely can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsEpCvcEfo). I do it every day. Sometimes it needs DLSS to get there, but most games are just fine without it. You're way overestimating the difference in modern console architectures.\n\nBesides, a recent PC is almost guaranteed to have a better CPU and more RAM than consoles, so you're at an advantage anyhow, not a disadvantage like you seem to think. The biggest advantage consoles have is precached shaders, and not even a 4090 will help you overcome that.\n\nSeeing as you have a 4090, it's likely you enjoy maxing out slider bars just for the satisfaction of running max settings. But I dare you to [blind spot the difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjDgKXe8gxs) between max and [smartly optimized settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8VrFUi79yo) on modern games.",
      "\"3 years in gaming industry is a lifetime\" tell that to the 1080ti",
      "Yeah. I have a 27inch 1080p monitor for my 3060ti. Thought it was great when I first got it, but was blown away when I upgraded to 1440p. Performance is still great at 1440p (playing MW2 with ~110 fps on med/high).",
      "3070 is barely faster than a 3060ti. I’d say either get a 3060ti or go to the next tier and get a 3080",
      "> I agree. I don't know why some people say that GPUs are tied to a specific resolution.\n\nBecause inherently some GPUs are good for pushing 1080 or 1440p with price to performance, but the performance hit is too much for some in games upping the resolution to 4k. Some people want to play at higher refresh compared to resolution. \n\nIt's also a remnant of the days where the top end gpu would just barely run AAA games at 1080 ultra. Not until the 10 series of GPUs did we start to see 1440p/4k go more main stream. \n\nBut I don't think it's incorrect to say that a 3060ti is a 1080p/1440p card over 4k. Or a 4090 is a 4k card.",
      "It will for the vast majority. How many games can it not run at max settings with 60fps right now. And you think in 3 years anything but a very small minority won't run at 60fps medium settings? Lol.\n\n3060ti is better than what 85% of people have and better than what's in the consoles.",
      "Did you just link me cyberpunk ? The game that needs a 4090 and DLSS 3 for it to do 144 fps on 1440p ? Lmao",
      "People can't handle the truth. 3060ti absolutely cannot keep up in the next 2 years. I don't know why people are down voting you. Seems like they're just insecure to me."

Honestly tho I would have saved up for a bit longer and went with the 4080 for the extra vram and literally a 70%+ boost in performance over the 3070ti...\n\nEdit.

      "We are also at a time where we make fun of people who want more for their hard earned money.   \n  \nJust 2 generations ago the 3060ti was faster than the 2080 super, yet the 5060ti that just came out is only \\~30% faster than the **3060ti** and only \\~15% faster than the **4060ti**. It is abysmal and it should be called out. Not everyone is made of money and offering this kind of \"uplift\" for nearly 500$ (real world money, MSRP no longer exists) is pathetic. I would expect the 5060ti to be at least 5-10% better than the base 4070 for that amount of money.",
      "From the 40 series to the 50 series there is such a small uplift in performance that it's basically not really worth at all to upgrade unless you can flip your card and break even.

      "There's nothing wrong with the 5060Ti 16GB - the ASUS Dual seems like a really good MSRP option at £400.  It's not worth moving up to fancy AIB models as you get into 4070 Super territory quite quickly.\n\nThe 8GB model really should not exist though.",
      "We are at a time where bitching about nvidia gets everyone happy and riled up so positive reviews/comments will be bashed and shot down. Do your own comparison and take into account how much frame gen helps in your use cade then determine if you should buy it at a reasonable price more than half the people here dont have a 50 series card and continue pushing the narrative to feel better",
      "Congrats, you have spent more than 400usd for a 30% uplift after 4 years. \n\nCall me czech, but I think that kind of progress is shit.",
      "5070 was kind of a sleeper for sure. Absolute junk generational uplift, but basically a 4070s that retailed for $50 cheaper at $550. \n\nWith all the bad reviews and hate it was easy to scoop one for or near retail price. If you are looking for features like dldsr/dlss/CUDA then nothing even remotely affordable besides the 5070. Only other option would be spending $750+ on a 5070ti (many models being $850+).\n\n9070xt def the better deal but trying to get one anywhere near $599 was basically impossible unless you could drive to a physical retailer. Most AIBs models were near 5070ti retail pricing.",
      "This is good to know. I'm rolling a 2080 super and was holding out to see if the 5080 super will end up with more memory and improved quality / stability. Hoping that the 5080 super might be more bang for buck of an upgrade if I can get one early/on release.",
      "Is upgrading every generation really a necessity for most people here?",
      "i can halfway agree with this statement cuz i still hold onto my 3070 and i see the 50 series as the 2nd wave shipment of the 40 cards",
      "Calling the OP a \"beta\" because he's buying a GPU now instead of at some time in the past when he could have gotten a better deal is nonsense.\n\nAlso I don't see a \"flex\" here. He upgraded and he's happy with it. I'm sure he would have liked to pay less money-- we'd all like to pay less money for new GPUs.",
      "Yes, some people just have that kind of money to spend and I can’t imagine spending that kind of money every 2 or so years",
      "You call it an outlier but it was a genuine generational upgrade, sadly it made Nvidia realize there is no point giving people 50% more performance in a generational upgrade when they can give us 10-15% every other year and everyone will somehow still be happy.\n\nThe fact that there are people defending (not you specifically, but too many people on this sub) this planned obsolescence is blowing my mind. They're going to reduce the generational performance uplift to 5% and introduce 2 new locked software features in like 2 generations and people will still defend the mega corporation.\n\nI'm not sure these people realize Nvidia does not know them nor has their best interest in mind, only their own, which is making billions of dollars by doing the bare minimum with absolutely no care for the customer. As far as they are concerned they'd give you a 1% generational uplift if you as a consumer kept being silent and did not push back.",
      "I mean, it depends on the price you got it for. If you paid msrp then it could be fine. If you paid over chances are you couldve gotten way better value.",
      "I like the 5060ti 16gb. I'd be happier with it if it was 350 instead of 430+, but imo it's in a good spot in terms of performance, access to the Nvidia feature set, and overall price. It compares pretty favorably to the 5070 and the and 9070 in terms of price to performance, and I think both of those cards are even more inflated over MSRP than the 5060ti is. \n\nIt also fills a common niche, which is a pretty good 1440p card that will do good frame rates for you in native, won't completely tank if using ray tracing, and gives you enough baseline performance that you can use a combo of upscaling and frame gen to get it up to a high refresh rate. Having that extra 4gb of VRAM over the 5070 will also have relevance in some edge cases, and could become more relevant with the new console gen. \n\nLots of people hating on it compare it to previous gens, but I'm more interested in what your money will buy today.",

    "selftext": "So I was having issues with my 3060 TI when playing the fairly recent triple A’s, and Oblivion was the last drop for wanting the GPU upgrade. \n\nI bought a 9070xt due to some recommendations but the game is constantly crashing. Since my current benchmark is the game that I want to spam, was wondering if anyone with a 5070 TI 16gb was experiencing a poor performance on the game? Stutters and crashes, fps drops, anything really. \n\nCurrently I can return the 9070 and get the 5070 for just 60€ more. Is this a good upgrade?\n\nEDIT: The error for the crash is \"EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION\" and its related to \"amd_fidelityfx_dx12\"",
    "comments": [
      "The game on its own isnt optimized, a 9800x3d and 5090 cant hold a stable framerate while moving around in the overworld.",
      "I also switched from nvidia to the 9070 XT recently and had similar issues. Constant crashes in monster hunter plus occasionally in other games. I looked at the AMD Adrenalin app and saw my clock speeds were boosting 300 MHZ higher than what it said on the box, and I already had an OC model. I set a -250MHZ frequency offset and have had essentially zero issues since then. I'd recommend a similar downclock so it's only running at about 3000 MHZ  as this is the base spec that they SHOULD be boosting to by default. If crashes still happen after that then at that point I'd return it, that's not much more for something that will hopefully won't overclock itself to death. That being said, people are also making a big stink about nvidia's drivers for the new cards and I can't speak for those.",
      "It could still be the game, as it is super janky, it has all the Gamebryo and Unreal Engine jank combined together.\n\nFirst you should try rebuilding the Shader Cache. You must delete everything in the Game's Oblivion Remastered folder in My Documents, including your saves. You can copy your saves to another folder while doing this but the whole folder structure needs to be deleted. You can add the saves back in after the game has rebuilt the Shader Cache.\n\nAlso check that you are not running any V-sync or Frame Limiter in the game's settings. AMD/Nvidia Control Panel V-sync can be ok, but in Unreal Engine it shouldn't be enabled, at least in this game's case.",
      "Yes the game cannot run well on any hardware regardless of settings, some people are fine with stutters though it seems.\n\nAs for why its crashing for you it might be the game might be the gpu :/ Did you use DDU when making the switch?",
      "Even a 5090 has jank and stutters in oblivion remastered\n\nBut 60 euros more for a 5070ti id consider it\n\nI have a 9070xt no crashes just the jank shit engine stutters",
      "For only 60 EUR more i would take the 5070ti  anyway.\n\nBetter RT (much better path tracing), DLSS4 and less power consumption.",
      "FSR4 made huge leaps over FSR3 and is really good now, but it’s not on DLSS4 transformer model level.",
      "For only 60 more I’d definitely get the 5070ti\n\nAnd the studders and frame drops are just because UE5 is ass. I have a 4090 and get constant hitches and frame drops in Clair Obscur, which is also UE5",
      "A) AMD recommends a 750W PSU for the RX 9070 XT. Make sure your PSU is powerful enough.    \nB) For the same price, the RTX 5070 Ti is a better GPU than the 9070 XT (assuming Nvidia fixes their driver issues)   \nC) This is what I did 2 years ago when I upgraded from the RTX 3080 to the 7900 XTX and I've had no issues since:     \ni) Stop windows from replacing your AMD GPU drivers. Try the group policy solution from this guide: https://computerinfobits.com/how-to-stop-windows-from-updating-graphics-drivers/#stop-automatic-updates-through-the-local-group-policy-editor    \nNote: If you have Windows 10/11 Home Edition: https://windowsreport.com/enable-gpedit-windows-11/    \nii) Download DDU (https://www.guru3d.com/download/display-driver-uninstaller-download/)    \niii) After that, boot Windows in safe mode (https://www.itpro.com/operating-systems/microsoft-windows/361662/how-to-boot-windows-11-in-safe-mode) and run DDU to remove all traces of your current GPU drivers    \niv) Power off your PC and insert the new GPU.     \nv) Boot into Windows, download and install the Adrenalin drivers of your choice. Done!",
      "But isn't optimized for PCs in general you mean? Its true, the stable framerate is insane really. Although when refering to crashes I've not seen that many from Nvidea being reported, hence my doubt in just chaning the GPU",
      "I have 5070ti and 9800x3d and i run oblivion at ultra except RT which is on high and DLSS quality with 60+ fps, no stuttering for me except on autosave.\n\nCrashed couple of times but in average like once per 5 hours so its pretty good, might also be caused by mods and shaders i added.",
      "Do you have the latest optional driver installed?\nhttps://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-4-1.html\nThis driver added support for oblivion.",
      "I have a 5070 ti and while it doesn’t crash for me. It drops to under 10 fps like every 10 second. Runs like crap and needs to get fixed.",
      "You might have to go with a fresh windows install to get the AMD card working correctly. I have seen enough instances where nothing but a clean install would let the drivers install correctly when swapping from AMD or Nvidia to the other.\n\nI am assuming you have tried DDU in safe mode.....",
      "Will try this and reinstall the game, will get back to you. Thanks!",
      "Tried it, crashed due to \"amd\\_fidelityfx\\_dx12\". Going to go for the Nvidia 5070 TI, thanks for the help!",
      "My main issue isn't the stutters, it's really the constant crashes. I'm getting PTSD when entering/leaving instances.",
      "I'm going to try it now. Since its a downclock, I'm guessing it won't affect warranty/returning policy?",
      "Just crashed the first time today. It helped reduce the crashing that's for sure, didn't solve it 100%. I'm probably moving for the 5070 TI. Thank you for the help!",
      "I've heard that the FSR4 is more or less at the same level as the DLSS4. Also got a 850W PSU, expecting new additions in the future"

Thanks in advance.\n\nETA: Feel like it’s a matter of time before I get dogged for saying no to AMD, I wasn’t aware there were no compatibility issues, feel free to recommend AMD cards and I’ll do my research, I just have no idea how the naming system works for them so it’s hard to tell what is what.",
    "comments": [
      "I mean, it's fine if you say please don't recommend Nvidia I just want AMD. But if you say it the other way they'll just downvote you to hell. That's just reddit being dumb so just ignore them. \n\nFor your question, the 4060 is clearly the better choice.",
      "You'll be fine. The 4060 is a super efficient GPU and only uses around 100W, maybe 150W with overclocked model under full load. Theoretically a 300W psu is enough but they don't really exist these day so they recommended 550W, but 450W is more than enough for an old gen i5 and a 4060",
      "The 4060 is just flat out better in 95% of scenarios, in games like RE4 Remake, the VRAM of the 3060 makes a difference, but generally the 40 series is just outright a better pick if similarly priced.",

      "The 4060 is around 60% faster than the 1660ti according to Tech PowerUp. You also get access to DLSS which really helps a lot if you want to try 1440p",

Beats both the RTX 3060 and 4060 in raster, and is about equal to the RTX 3070 while having more VRAM, though it is slower than both the 3070 and 4060 at ray tracing. Though no card at this budget is great at RT anyway. No compatibility issues, will run perfectly fine.\n\nIf you get it, just make sure to use DDU (display driver uninstaller) to reset your GPU drives, then download the latest ones from AMDs website.\n\nThat said, your post didn't have your PSU listed. If you're below 550ish watts, and don't want to get a new PSU, the 4060 is your best bet. It's quite a bit more power efficient than the 6700XT",
      "I’d definitely get the 4060 or if u can find a good priced Rx 6700 xt/6750 xt. I know what you mean by sticking with what your comfortable with, I’ve been used both brands as I went from a rtx 3050 laptop to a Rx 7900 xt then to the rtx 2080 ti currently and I can definitely say that amd is good, go with whatever u find for cheaper and better value. Personally tho once u learn amd softwares it’s a lot better in my opinion but either way you’ll have a good experience",

      "Never had any vram issues at 1080p, which is what you should be playing using this card, and I played some pretty heavy AAA games",
      "There is 0 need for DDU going from Nvidia to Nvidia my friend didn't even use it when upgrading from a 1050 to a 6950xt he just uninstalled the drivers through windows and has had 0 issues almost 2 years later",
      "Do you have to get it right this moment? Can you wait 4+ months? Probably you can get a 5060 at that time if you can. \n\nI would not buy a 4060 personally. The lowest I'd go in the 40 series is the 4070 for under $500 otherwise the 4070S at $600. Failing that, I would get the 3060 if it was under $280 or so. Especially if you want to switch to 1440p. The second you come onto reddit in a few months asking why your 4060 sucks at 1440p, the same clowns telling you to get it now will just tell you \"4060 is a 1080p card you shouldn't expect it to perform at 1440p\" despite the fact that you mentioned it in your post. \n\nI don't know why anyone uses reddit for GPU info in the first place. Just go onto youtube and watch GamersNexus and HUB. That's honestly all you need. They will tell you not to get the 4060 though.",
      "The notion that buying a 3060 is a better choice than a 4060 is due to a lot of misinfo. The 4060 is going to be better 99% of the time for most tasks and will only lose to the 3060 in scenarios where the VRAM is a bottleneck. Again, this will almost never happen at 1080p and if it happens, you turn the textures settings down one notch and/or you use DLSS, and it'll be okay. I have been enjoying the latest AAA releases and I never had an issue, I don't know if the VRAM will represent more of an issue in the future, but by the time it does I'll probably have a more powerful card.",
      ">  I don’t know very much about gaming pcs \n\nSo you should probably listen to people who do instead of tying yourself in knots with weird preconceptions.\n\nRegardless, the 4060 is a weird card. On paper and on average it is better than a 3060, but in a lot of particular programs it is equal or dramatically worse. It is worth checking individual benchmarks for programs you care about.\n\nMost likely you could get a way better card on the used market, or leftover last gen parts, like an RTX 3070, RX 6700 XT, ect.",
      "What are the used prices? Are they half-price or 25% off? If so, that would be a great deal for a used card that comes with a 2-year warranty. You guys in the UK are lucky! \n\nBut then again, IIRC, aren't PC parts way too expensive there anyway?"

My guess is 4K isn’t gonna be something you could reliably test unless you went and got a 4K setup and play on 1080p for some reason.  Even if your monitor can only do 1080p you can often run it at 1440p and it will downscale.  But if you don’t have a monitor that can do 1440p, idk why get that high end of a GPU.",

You can technically get 60 FPS if you turn off ray reconstruction, but the image is insanely noisy otherwise and looks really bad. Regardless, I wanted to show off how impressive both DLSS 4 Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction are for a GPU that isn't in the specs sheet to run this game.\n\nEdit: Not too sure why the first image is really blurry, but the others are just fine. Some graininess is noticeable since it's a still image, but playing in motion it's hardly noticeable other than on fire and smoke effects.\n\nEdit 2: This is actually on the perform preset since Ray Reconstruction can't be used on Ultra Performance. I was mistaken since the option was still selected so I assumed that RR just gave a resolution bump as well.",
      "This is gonna be the new “the human eye cannot perceive more than 30 fps” isn’t it? \n\nIt’s not gonna make the game look like a different game.

      "You might since a 3060ti is the minimum GPU required, while my RTX 3060 isn't on the spec sheet. Although they said a 3060ti will be minimum for 1080p 30 fps and that's on DLSS performance, so can squeeze a bit more setting it to Ultra Performance but i doubt it'll hit 60.",
      "I think you'll find the vast majority of people disagree, but really, it's hard to judge something like Path-tracing unless you see it in motion.\n\nThat's obviously impossible to see in a screenshot, and it's hard to see on a low bit-rate YouTube video.",

This is almost like comparing 1660 Super to RTX 2060: performance gap isn't that big and the 1660 feels like better value.\n\nAnother take, this might make it easier to get a 3070 if people \"give up\" on getting one if the performance gap is small.

      "I see some BS comments so lemme comment as a 3060Ti owner.\n\nIt's okay as a 1440p card, but it will depend on what games you play and whether you will be modding in high texture mods.\n\nFor example, most older games (Witcher 3, Far Cry 5, etc) will have at least 90+ FPS on high/max settings. Shooter games (like BF and CoD series) will be the same.\n\nHowever, unoptimized games (i.e. Hogwarts Legacy, Starfield) and graphics demanding games (i.e. Cyberpunk 2077) are going to either struggle keeping 60+ fps or will fall far short of that, even with mid graphics settings (you may achieve 60+fps with optimization mods and other tinkering).\n\nKeep in mind, all fps mentioned are without ray-tracing, so if you plan on ray tracing for RT-available games, then the 3060Ti is not for you.\n\nIf you don't mind the occasional 30fps on certain games then I think it will be okay, for now. (Games are going to be more demanding in the future and seeing how a lot of devs are relying on DLSS/FG tech, you may want to reconsider).\n\n[(For reference) Techpowerup review on 3060Ti](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition/&ved=2ahUKEwj7mMaK_o-CAxVUQ94KHZgUCy4QFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2gEBPH1T_r0PALK72gQdB1)",

It's a great card and one of the best values when I purchased it. I have no regrets at all.",

      "At current GPU price to performance ratio, future proofing isn't really a thing.\n\nAdditionally we're sorta in a tech transition period between rasterization and RT/PT, personally I don't really see a plateau-ing of \"stretching our dollar\" GPU tech till maybe 3 card generations down.\n\nHell, even if you get a 4090, an argument can be made that you'll miss out on new features etc, though if you can afford a 4090, you're in a different spending bracket.\n\nSimply don't worry about future proofing, just live within your means and enjoy what you can, remove yourself from FOMO or whatever it is called these days.",

They're 100% being inflated by software gains/dlss 3.0. \n\n\nSuch a scummy move from nvidia this whole generation.

The refresh rate of your monitor is also irrelevant, because depending on the game, the GPU may or may not be able to push that. At lower resolutions tho, the CPU is more important, as the GPU can push higher framerates, so if the CPU can't keep up, it's going to bottleneck, whereas at higher resolutions the GPU is more limited, so the CPU doesn't have to be able to run such a high framerate. \n\nA 3700X is fine with a 3060Ti or 3070 or even 3080 at 1080p, and 1440p, and 4k (tho the 3060Ti and 3070 will struggle with 4k, but the CPU won't have any issue). 1440p and 4k are actually easier on the CPU lol",

Often my 5800X only shows 20-40% in that moment, but it's my CPU and/or memory speed being the issue while my GPU usage can be anywhere from 40-70% depending on the game.\n\nMost AAA games are fully GPU bottlenecked though, at least till you start lowering settings.

This will be sorted alphabetically.\n\n# Written Articles\n\n# Anandtech - TBD\n\n# [Arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/nvidia-announces-the-399-rtx-3060-ti-and-weve-tested-it/)\n\n>Otherwise, there's not a ton to say about RTX 3060 Ti that hasn't been spelled out with its costlier siblings. DLSS still impresses as a proprietary upsampling and anti-aliasing system, and that, combined with solid ray-tracing tech, continues to make Nvidia cards a tantalizing option—especially when clock speeds and CUDA cores have been reduced to hit the $399 sweet spot while still otherwise looking quite performative.  \n>  \n>Meanwhile, if your favorite games don't tap into DLSS, you should expect to tinker with their settings to maximize their 1440p or 1080p performance levels—and I can't help but imagine AMD has a response to this exact use case with any future lower-priced RX 6000-series GPUs. But nothing of the sort has been announced yet, so for the time being, Nvidia takes the lead at this price point.\n\n# Babeltechreviews - TBD\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfASASNLgIk)\n\n>Across the bulk of our testing, the RTX 3060 Ti has shown itself to be a solid value, often delivering nearly 90 per cent of the performance of the RTX 3070 while costing closer to 85 per cent of the price. In most games, the 3060 Ti manages to hold a clear advantage over the RTX 2080 Super, a card that costs £320 more and came out just last summer, underlining the impressive boost Nvidia has been able to find this generation.  \n>  \n>In more modern games, especially those that use RT effects, the 3060 Ti is even better still. It's a particular blow against AMD, with the 3060 Ti out-muscling the significantly more expensive RX 6800 XT in most of the RT game scenes we tested. The 3060 Ti is also among the most power-efficient cards we've found so far, although the 3070 and RX 6800 were able to deliver a superior 'joules per frame' measurement in one of the two games we used for judging this. Clearly, the Ampere architecture is as competitive in the mid-range as it is at the very top.  \n>  \n>But perhaps the best argument to be made for the RTX 3060 Ti comes in its performance differentials against the 10-series Pascal cards, where you're often getting 80 to 90 per cent more performance than the venerable GTX 1070, with even GTX 1080 Ti often humbled by the output of the new card. While RTX 3060 Ti will work best at 1440p resolution, the fact is that 1080 Ti still runs a wide range of games well at 4K resolution - where 3060 Ti will do considerably better, even before we factor in the inclusion of DLSS. We're *really* looking forward to testing this with Cyberpunk 2077.\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/articles-pages/geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founder-edition-review,1.html)\n\n>Gosh, I think I spoiled it all in the very first paragraphs of this conclusion page; the market needs cheaper cards that can easily beat the new consoles at performance and price for PC gaming to keep making sense. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is a bit of an inbetweener. I think it performs extremely well, but realistically graphics cards in the sub 500 USD range are all 100 USD too expensive. How cool would this product have been at 299 USD? See what I am getting at? I know, I know .. wishful thinking.  \n>  \n>Performance-wise we cannot complain; it is RTX 2080 SUPER and even 2080 Ti territory that this card is tackling. An ongoing trend with all new technologies, of course, is an increase in graphics memory, or better yet, growing demand and thirst for it. Up-to 2560x1440, really, you're good to go with 8GB for now. In Ultra HD, you'll quickly run out of VRAM in the future and thus stamina as frames bounce back and forth due to the lack of it. Overall this is a solid performing product that will please the masses. You'll get excellent framerates in the aforementioned resolutions with bitter-sweet eye-candy at the best quality setting. It's also a graphics card that allows you to fool around and twiddle a bit with Hybrid raytracing.   \n>  \n>On DX-R, we stopped testing games that are marked with Raytracing that only do shadows. It's a waste of performance as the rasterizer engine is simple by far good enough. Games with raytraced reflections, that's what you should be after, and that's what we''ll call a properly raytraced game. For this card, DXR in Full DH is a good option, and you can get a nice buddy assist when the game also supports DLSS v2.0.  \n>  \n>The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti overall performs well on all fronts, performance, cooling acoustics, and yeah, the new founder edition cards look sweet as well. The big question will remain to be availability. NVIDIA\" biggest challenge for weeks now. DO NOT even dare to buy these products even 20 bucks over reference prices at etailers. Purchase it when prices are FAIR. It's the only way scalpers and greedy etailers will learn and understand, bring back respect to what allows them to keep running their businesses, you guys .. the customers should come first. The last line (I promise) would have loved to see this card being 299 USD for it to be a hit. But even at its current pricing, it's a product we can certainly recommend.\n\n# [Hexus](https://hexus.net/tech/reviews/graphics/147016-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition/)\n\n>Nvidia extends the reach of its gaming Ampere architecture by releasing the best value model yet. GeForce RTX 3060 Ti takes much of the '70's goodness and distils it down to a £369 price point. Still not cheap, of course, but there's enough horsepower under the attractive hood to play the latest games at excellent framerates at a QHD resolution and also make a decent attempt at rendering 4K visuals with acceptable performance.  \n>  \n>Crucial to Nvidia's ambitions with this GPU is that rival AMD presently has nothing new to counter it. RTX 3060 Ti is comfortably faster than last-gen RX 5700 XT and crushes even the latest Big Navi cards once ray tracing and DLSS are turned on.  \n>  \n>The Founders Edition is barely discernible in a quiet chassis when full-on gaming, so Nvidia has set the bar very high for AIC partners building their own cards, presumably with a hefty price premium attached to them.  \n>  \n>We come away impressed with the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti FE 8GB card because the gaming performance is more than adequate for 90 per cent of gamers out there. Building a £1,000-£1,500 base unit or upgrading from much older graphics and want to play with all the eye candy turned on at decent resolutions? It's hard to look past this card, and FE in particular, so we hope there is enough stock to sate what is sure to be significant demand.\n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-gpu-review)\n\n>GeForce RTX 3060 Ti cards are slated to start shipping tomorrow. The NVIDIA Founders Edition card has an MSRP of $399 and overclocked partner boards like the [MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming X Trio](https://amzn.to/2KWqRhH) will obviously be priced higher (usually by about $20 - $60), depending on the level of customization, additional features, and how high the GPU clock is, etc. GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition cards will be available directly from Best Buy and Microcenter, and partner boards will be sold by all of the usual suspects, though product is likely to disappear quickly, as has been the case with all of the recent GPU launches.  \n>  \n>Assuming customers can get their hands on cards at or near MSRP, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is an excellent option. Performance is in the neighborhood of the GeForce RTX 2080 Super, and well ahead of cards like the Radeon RX 5700 XT or RTX 2060 Super, all of which are currently selling for much more than the 3060 Ti’s MSRP. This card's 8GB frame buffer may give some of you pause, but for 1080p – 1440p gaming, it shouldn’t be a problem for the overwhelming majority of titles, and it’s par for the course in this price bracket anyway.  \n>  \n>We’ll have to wait until the current craziness ends to see where pricing on previous-gen cards ultimately settles, but if you’re looking for a GPU in the $400-ish price range, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is the obvious choice. It offers performance in-line with more expensive cards, arrives at the same MSRP as the GeForce RTX 2060 Super, and its feature set it second to none.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-ampere-fatter-far-far-far-away-and-point-on-quiet-path-from-this-claw/)\n\n>In general, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is successful all around, because it is faster than a GeForce RTX 2080 Super, costs significantly less than its counterpart at that time and has become significantly more efficient. For a final assessment, including that of the market positioning, one will, however, have to wait for the launch of the new Radeon RX 6700 XT. I already wrote that NVIDIA’s feature set ranges from the usual RTX components such as raytracing and DLSS 2.0, to various RTX software (video, voice) for the end user, to the entire studio and workstation applications.  \n>  \n>Especially in the semi-professional areas AMD is currently rather at a disadvantage and you will have to wait and see what will be launched in the future besides the new hardware. So everyone will have to set their own premises and ask themselves what value which feature and use case really has (or not) for them. A review can’t take this decision away from anyone, it’s up to each person to decide for themselves. I repeat myself, also with regard to the text on the RTX 3070? The cards are so similar in their orientation that you can hardly think of anything else.  \n>  \n>The MSRP of EUR 399 is certainly an incentive, but there is initial information on board partner cards that they are likely to be considerably more expensive. A circulated MSRP of 470 or 500 USD for cards from MSI or Asus is a somewhat harder announcement, unfortunately. In principle, however, it would also straighten the FE loosely, because it has no faults. If it should really be available. I prefer not to make any predictions.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lmPLt2vO2k&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>The **Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti** is the latest in a long line of GPUs to have launched over the past couple of months, but importantly it is the cheapest of those, with a UK MSRP coming in at £369. Availability aside, the RTX 3060 Ti is an important step in getting the Ampere architecture to the wider market.  \n>  \n>Despite the lower price tag, Nvidia claimed the RTX 3060 Ti is faster than the RTX 2080 Super, which launched for £669 in July 2019. Based on our testing today, that claim does hold true. Averaged over the 14 games we benchmarked, at 1080p the RTX 3060 Ti is 2% faster than the RTX 2080 Super, and that increases to 3% at 1440p. At most, the RTX 3060 Ti was 8% faster, and it came in 5% slower at worst. It’s clearly not a big difference at all, and generally we’d call that level of performance a tie. Of those fourteen games we tested though, the RTX 3060 Ti is only slower in three of them.  \n>  \n>That means this new Ampere GPU is on average 34% faster than the RTX 2060 Super at 1080p, and 39% faster at 1440p. It even looks relatively good against the RTX 3070, as it is just 11% and 12% slower on average, at 1080p and 1440p respectively – not bad considering it is also £100 cheaper.  \n>  \n>It really is a very capable GPU for high refresh-rate 1080p or 1440p gaming, delivering solid frame rates across the board at either resolution. In fact, at 1440p, the lowest average frame rate we saw with the 3060 Ti was exactly 60FPS, and that came when playing Red Dead Redemption 2 at ultra settings, which is about as demanding as it gets.  \n>  \n>We also tested 4K, but I wouldn’t focus too much on this aspect of the card’s performance. Just like the RTX 2080 Super, it certainly can play at 4K, hitting 60-70FPS in less demanding titles like Death Stranding or F1 2020. Anything that will stress the GPU more – something like Control, Gears 5 or the aforementioned Red Dead Redemption 2 – sees the frame rate drop down into the 30FPS. For me, this is a quality 1440p 60FPS+ GPU, so while it can do 4K *sometimes*, for a proper 4K experience you’d need to step up to at least the RTX 3070, but ideally the RTX 3080.\n\n# [Legit Reviews](https://www.legitreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review_224067)\n\n>The performance of the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition was impressive. It bested the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Founders Edition ($799) from 2018 in everything and traded blows with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Super ($699) from 2019. It ripped through the 1080P game titles with ease and shows that it was a very capable at 1440P game titles as well. 4K gaming performance was solid for this price point with its 8GB of GDDR6 memory, but the GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 are still the best choice for those gamers looking to run at 4K or beyond.  \n>  \n>Power consumption, noise levels and thermal performance of the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti was exceptional. We never broke 70C while gaming on our open air test platform and couldn’t hear the GPU cooler fans running over our AIO liquid cooler and other fans that were running. There as no choke noise and the power numbers were good with the card using at most 235 Watts on our 3DMark Time Spy run.  \n>  \n>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti appears to be a solid upgrade option for those that are wanting a performance boost at the $399 price point. AMD doesn’t have a new Radeon RX 6000 series card to compete against at this price, so NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is easily the card to get.\n\n# [OC3D Article](https://www.overclock3d.net/reviews/gpu_displays/nvidia_rtx_3060_ti_founders_edition_review/1)\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2_bhg13Eu0)\n\n>There is no doubt that when it comes to looking at purchasing a new GPU it is, for all but the very luckiest ones amongst you, a balance between the performance you desire and the performance you can achieve. Yes we'd all love the insanity and futureproofing that a RTX 3090 brings to the party, but few amongst us have remotely got the financial clout to have one. Especially after this year which has been trying to say the least.  \n>  \n>The RTX 3060 Ti has a whole different cast of comparisons depending largely upon the graphics card you currently have in your system, the graphics card that Nvidia claim it is comparable to, and of course the price point it launches at. Some of these are much easier to cover with blanket statements than others. If you've got any card that was released before the Turing Nvidia ones, GTX 1080 Ti or below, then the RTX 3060 Ti will blow you away with its performance. To say it would be an upgrade compared to those cards is to very much under value how much of an upgrade it would be. It'll stun you with how quickly the performance possibility has moved on and how affordable that level of ability is now, certainly compared to how much it would have cost to upgrade from a Maxwell to a Turing card.  \n>  \n>If you've got a RTX 2060 or RTX then it will still be a decent improvement if you're just looking to get a little more out of your system without breaking the bank. Once you reach RTX 2080 territory though, in either vanilla, Super, or Ti forms, then things get a little trickier. You've already spent a considerable wedge on those cards, and the RTX 3060 Ti wouldn't give you enough of an upgrade to justify the outlay.  \n>  \n>Looking at the RTX 3060 Ti in a vacuum the performance is consistently good throughout all of our testing. Certainly at the super popular 1080 or 1440 resolutions it really gets the job done and is smooth no matter what we threw at it, either AAA games or older but still visually lovely games, with everything cranked to the stops. At 4K it's not so amazing but then it's not really aimed at 4K gaming, even though you could get away with some careful setting tweaking to bring the frame rate up. It is also close enough, ish, to the RTX 3070 that if your budget is extremely tight then you'll expect to have to make some settings adjustments to give you the smoothest game play. Very few of us have ever had the system to be able to just stick everything on full and play.  \n>  \n>The RTX 3060 Ti FE requires you to change fewer settings than ever before to get buttery smooth game play in any title around, and we think that is the biggest string to its bow. It's a sub £400 card that acts like a card costing twice the price just a generation ago. If your budget is strict then you can't get more gaming prowess for your money, bang for buck if you like, from anything else around. At this price it makes them a whole lot more accessible - lets hope they actually have enough stock they don't all sell out in 10 minutes again.\n\n# [PC Perspective](https://pcper.com/2020/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review/)\n\n>As promised, this review was pretty short. NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti launches tomorrow (December 2) for $399, and considering the performance (better than an RTX 2080) we saw here – which marks quite a substantial upgrade over the RTX 2060 Super it replaces at this price point – the RTX 3060 Ti is a fantastic choice in the fantasy world in which it would be widely available at launch.  \n>  \n>Once again, this is a launch review. We haven’t seen availability yet. The Founders Edition we looked at will be sold exclusively through NVIDIA.com and Microcenter here in the USA, which means sales at the $399 list price – when the card is in stock.  \n>  \n>So, assuming you can find one, I think it’s easy to recommend this new GPU – particularly as AMD does not currently offer a 6000 Series product to compete at this price level.\n\n# [PC World](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3599092/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review.html)\n\n>At $400, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti immediately kills any remaining value proposition for comparable last-gen graphics cards like the Radeon RX 5700, 5700 XT, GeForce RTX 2060, and 2060 Super, unless you score one at a massive discount. Don’t count on seeing those discounts in today’s economy, though. Rather than splurging on older tech at this point, be patient and wait to get your hands on this GPU.  \n>  \n>Nvidia’s unorthodox RTX 30-series Founders Edition cooling continues to impress, though less so the further we move down the stack. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti FE’s 72-degree Celsius temperatures and soft, but audible noise levels don’t disappoint, especially for a card made by Nvidia itself, but there is room for partner cards from EVGA, Asus and others to improve things. (Stay tuned for many custom RTX 3060 Ti reviews in the coming days—we’ve already got several in our hands.) We still dislike the proprietary 12-pin power connector that Nvidia used with its Founders Edition cards this generation to squeeze in a smaller PCB. The company includes an adapter in the box, but that adapter is too short and looks chunky and ugly compared to nicer traditional cabling options.  \n>  \n>Don’t let that dissuade you, though. Performance this fast cost twice as much last generation and landed near the top of the RTX 20-series stack. Getting this much eye candy for $400 is *very* welcome indeed. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is spectacular—a virtually flawless 1440p GPU, minor Founders Edition design squabbles aside. Here’s hoping stocks are plentiful and custom variants aren’t priced as extravagantly as the higher-up RTX 30-series options, because this GPU should sell like hotcakes.\n\n# TechGage - TBD\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition/)\n\n>With the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, NVIDIA is finally pushing Ampere below the $500 price point, which makes it attractive to an even larger audience of gamers. The new RTX 3060 Ti is based on the same GA104 graphics processor as the RTX 3070, just with some rendering units disabled. The RTX 3060 Ti is targeted at definite 1440p gaming with 60 FPS and entry-level 4K at lower details or with DLSS enabled. Raytracing is a core focus of NVIDIA's Ampere lineup, too. The RTX 3060 Ti will offer a great RT experience at 1080p and 1440p in most titles.  \n>  \n>NVIDIA is positioning the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition at $399, which is an extremely competitive price. At that price point, it offers price/performance comparable to the GTX 1660 Super, which has the best price/performance ratio of all NVIDIA offerings. It would also be a better deal than the Radeon RX 5600 XT. If you can find an RTX 3060 Ti at $400, then definitely go for it. I'm having my doubts, though. Looking at recent launches from both AMD and NVIDIA, it seems the MSRP price points are a fantasy true for only the first batch, there to impress potential customers, with actual retail pricing ending up much higher. Looking at the other RTX 3060 Ti reviews today, we had a hard time getting price points out of many manufacturers, and what we got was substantially higher than $400, with the ASUS STRIX at $500, MSI Gaming X at $470, and Palit at $440+. From vendors, I heard that \"the supply should be pretty good,\" but that \"it also might not be enough for more than a few hours\" or that \"we might see $500 soon,\" so let's wait a few days and hope people will actually be able to buy this fantastic graphics card at reasonable pricing.\n\n# Techspot - TBD\n\n# [The FPS Review](https://www.thefpsreview.com/2020/12/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review/)\n\n>We think the new GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is exciting for several reasons.  At its $399 price point, it is reachable to more gamers.  According to our testing, it can provide up to 50% better performance compared to the previous generation GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER at $399.  For the same price, that’s a nice upgrade only one year after the RTX 2060 SUPER launched.  It also provides an upgrade path from people on Radeon RX 5700’s or Radeon RX 5700 XT’s.  If you have a Radeon RX 5700 series GPU this one will give you a 30-40% upgrade in performance.   \n>  \n>It is also exciting because here is a $399 video card matching and beating a $699 GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER, and it’s doing it with less power usage.  The performance per Watt and efficiency have been improved.  You are getting more, for less, and that’s exciting.   \n>  \n>We think the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is going to be “the” card for a lot of people.  Not just for gamers, but also for streamers and creators.  We truly think that this is the perfect card for streamers using NVIDIA Broadcast.  It’s at an attractive price point and with its machine learning and AI capability with Tensor Cores is a powerful streaming card.   \n>  \n>A streamer may not need the fastest gaming card there is, but still the ability for esports gaming performance and such.  This would be the perfect card for that, not too expensive, plenty fast for the types of games streamers stream, NVIDIA Reflex support, and the flexibility of NVIDIA Broadcast.  We just see this card being popular among that group. For gamers, it’s also a good card.  If you aren’t a 4K gamer, you still game at 1440p or 1080p this is the card you are probably eyeing the most, and rightly so.   \n>  \n>At the end of the day, NVIDIA hit the mark on this video card, it’s very exciting.  It still gives you 8GB of RAM, not that 6GB nonsense, and will give you a great gameplay experience with useable Ray Tracing and DLSS.  The only problem is the supply of GPUs lately, but that’s an issue shared by everyone due to world issues.  We just have to get through this period of time, eventually, the cards will be available and out there in quantity.  Therefore we can review them now for you, so you know if it’s good when they become available. When they are, you owe it to yourself to give this one a look.\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review)\n\n>Now that we've seen the RTX 3070 along with AMD's RX 6800, we have a better feel for the GPU market we're likely to see during the coming year. AMD doesn't have a viable alternative to the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti at the $400 price point yet, so for now, this is the undisputed upper mainstream champion. Some might say $400 isn't really a mainstream GPU, but given the sales of previous-gen GTX 1070 and RTX 2060 / 2060 Super cards, there are clearly plenty of people willing to spend that much money on a graphics card. And to be clear, this is a great card for that price.  \n>  \n>The RTX 3060 Ti is about 35-40 percent faster than the previous-gen 2060 Super and about 30 percent faster than AMD's RX 5700 XT — and that's without even getting into ray tracing or DLSS support. In ray tracing games, the 3060 Ti lead grows to 40-45 percent over the 2060 Super, and AMD's RX 5000 series doesn't even have the option to try and run DXR games. Even against AMD's new RX 6800, though, the RTX 3060 Ti delivers better overall DXR performance — and can improve by around 30 percent on average for games that support DLSS, using DLSS Quality mode  \n>  \n>If you already have an RTX 2080 Super or even a 2060 Super, there's not much need to upgrade to an RTX 3060 Ti. But if you purchased a GTX 1070 back in 2016 and you're still sitting on it today, you can now double your GPU performance for roughly the same price that the GTX 1070 launched at. Again, assuming you can find one in stock. As for AMD, an RX 6700 XT could be a formidable opponent, particularly in games that don't use ray tracing or DLSS. How long will we have to wait for those cards to arrive, and will AMD ship as many GPUs as Nvidia? After the RX 6800 launch, we're guessing the answer to the second part of that question is no, but we'll probably find out more in early 2021.  \n>  \n>Right now, Nvidia just gave a nice boost in performance and features to the $400 market. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is a relatively small step down from the RTX 3070, with a larger step down in price. That hits the sweet spot in both price and performance — in fact, out of the current and previous-gen GPUs, it's the best overall card in price to performance ratio (fps per dollar). If you're hoping to upgrade to a new graphics card, the RTX 3060 Ti definitely belongs on your shortlist.\n\n# [Computerbase - German](https://www.computerbase.de/2020-12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-asus-msi-test/)\n\n# [HardwareLuxx - German](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/54788-viermal-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-inklusive-founders-edition-im-test.html)\n\n# [PCGH - German](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-3060-Ti-Grafikkarte-276807/Tests/vs-3070-vs-2070-Super-Benchmark-Release-Review-Preis-1362666/)\n\n# [PCMR Latino America - Spanish](https://www.pcmrace.com/2020/12/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review/)\n\n# Video Review\n\n# [2kliksphillip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYZ8HPD2xdI)\n\n# [Bitwit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7EHYqeyiXU)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfASASNLgIk)\n\n# [Gamers Nexus Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9H2PfYDFok)\n\n# [Hardware Canucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpXxzzLOw00)\n\n# [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owrk_OnaPJo)\n\n# [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjF2w8MVjLA)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lmPLt2vO2k)\n\n# [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGyWz866AoM)\n\n# [OC3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2_bhg13Eu0)\n\n# [Optimum Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjg9Cgl8zWQ)\n\n# [Paul's Hardware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tduvVvsx0Xk)\n\n# [Tech Yes City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFuHVyypnFs)\n\n# The Tech Chap - TBD\n\n# [Techtesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkJ_9u5CYvg)",

      "Having just weathered the 6800/XT launch, it feels weird to have reviews available ahead of launch like this. This is how a company proceeds when they're confident in a product.",
      "I believe all Ampere cards except 3090 have pre-launchday review.",
      "Wow guru3d actually commented on the pricing situation, I hope this makes more people aware that these cards should be $300 again to make it competitive with consoles. It’s good value compared to 3070 absolutely but it’s still too expensive for budget minded pc gamers. We need a lot more cards in the <=$300 space. This is especially important for those living outside of USA where prices are even more ridiculous ($600 in Canada, same price as series x).",
      "EVGA queue\n\nhttps://www.evga.com/products/product.aspx?pn=08G-P5-3667-KR",
      "Budget minded pc gamers also don’t need a 2080S level of power. Are they playing at 1440p? If they are they sure as hell aren’t budget minded gamers and for 1080p the card is overkill.",
      "Seems like a great card and it seems like the RTX3050Ti/60 will be similarly great products but... I don't know how I'm gonna keep up with the price level increase. This MSRP with AIBs and EUR conversions will be easily above 500 when it hits my retailers. And then I'm optimistic to say stock levels won't be a problem in a few months. And exchange rates in my country are dogshit, with 500 eur prices this card is gonna cost 200k HUF. That's insane. An entire PS5/XSX is cheaper than that.\n\nAnd this is the 60 line, the supposedly mainstream, mid-range cards for everyday Joe's like me. I'm paying the same for middle tier cards ass I used to pay for the premium best.\n\nOh well, maybe I'll get lucky with a 60Ti or I'm waiting for the poverty edition cards (and I mean, I could pay for these, but it's hard for me to justify spending this much on gaming).",
      "Will still be a better fit than a 6800 with a whopping 16 GB it's never going to use.",
      "Why do you care what the last two digits of the model number are? This card is faster than the 2080 Super at a fraction of the price.",
      "Wow what an AMD fanboy! \"AMD has more VRAM, more MHZ! MUST BE BETTER RIGHT!!\" So disgusting. Both AMD and Nvidia cards are good. However no one can deny that AMD has done some scummy things this release. stop being a fanboy they're not your friends",
      "Why are you comparing to last gen, budget gamers absolutely want 3060 level performance. The last gen is irrelevant. The xx60 series has always been the entry level goto perf  card until Turing screwed everything up. As next gen games release, requirements will go up making 3060 necessary for good quality / performance even at 1080p. The xx50 cards have always been terrible and only suggested to people on a really low budget.",
      "I'm running a 3070 with a 550w power supply, you will be OK.",
      "I mean, they did the same thing with Ryzen 5000. Are you gonna tell me that they weren't confident in that product? Seems like just a typical marketing department decision (\"when people see the reviews, they might decide to buy it, so we should have them available to buy.\")",
      "The 5060 Ti",
      "Consoles are moving to 4K so your argument about 1080p is silly in my opinion. Budget 7 years ago is different from budget now, technology has increased. But yes a mid range card like the xx60 should absolutely give +80 FPS at 1080p and 1440p60 on high settings and actually will, the problem is the price. \n\nIf you’re suggesting budget gamers move down to the xx50, historically they provide a 1080p 30 FPS experience which is not ideal for anyone. Now if nvidia actually announces a rtx 3050 with ray tracing with promise of 1080p 60 at $200, or 1440p 60 without ray tracing at medium settings that would actually be a good budget option and would be similar to Xbox series s. Nothing amd or nvidia has done or said suggests this will happen.",
      "Before anyone asks, it's not yet up on the EU site.",
      "This isin't true.",
      "Budget is what the 50 cards should be.",
      "I'd rather be confident in a company that is several years ahead in DLSS and is currently spanking the 6800 in 4k despite having far less VRAM.",
      "in stock at microcenter on launch?",
      "You'll be ok. At stock, it's about 200w (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9H2PfYDFok), so your entire system should easily fit <400w peak usage."

      "Nearly a 3070 for $100 less.",
      "Sounds like normal high-end card price:perf scaling.  XD",
      "Just looking at those benchmarks, did Nvidia just kill the 3070 like 2 months after release and 2 months BEFORE widespread availability? The 10% or so difference isn't that much and much more importantly, theres nothing about the 3070 that promises to age better. \n\nSpecifically the same 8 GBs of vram running at the same speed  is puzzling - so whats the point of the 3070 now? If it had 10 GBs, or the 3060ti only had 6, you could make an argument for the 3070 being *slightly* more futureproof at higher resolutions but thats clearly not the case.",
      "Yea having a 3070, that stings a bit. 10-15% faster for 25% more at the mythical MSRP.",
      "It seems like 3080 and 3060Ti is the card to buy (at least now), and 3070 is kinda awkward sitting at that position. 3080 offers great performance increase from 3070 with a reasonable increase in price, while 3060Ti offers 90% performance of 3070 for 75% of the price.\n\nNo wonder why 3080 is still OOS everywhere, 3060Ti need to be better. Also lift the review embargo before launch (while just 1 day) is a pretty ballsy move.",
      "Probably easier to bin 3060tis, for now at least maybe.",
      "Why upgrade from a 2070s for 15%",
      "3060 Ti provides about 85% the performance of 3070\n\n3060 Ti is about 80% of the money of 3070\n\nYes 3060 Ti is a better value but it's not that big of a delta in the price/performance curve. \n\nI had 2080 Ti which is where 3070 lands and I can tell you that in a lot of applications at 1440p, 2080 Ti is the difference between breaking 60fps vs not breaking 60fps with 2080 Super.",
      "it is just a lower binned 3070",
      "That's literally how every products are. It's called binning and it's in both CPU and GPU market.",
      "This lineup is literally one of the cleanest they've ever done in recent memories. \n\nOnce you see where 3070 was going to land, you know exactly where all the lower end cards will land\n\n3070 = \\~2080 Ti replacement @ $500\n\n3060 Ti = 2080 Super+ performance @ $400\n\nRumored 3060 = Probably 2070 Super performance @ $300-350\n\nRumored 3050 Ti = Probably 2060 Super performance @ \\~$250\n\nRumored 3050 = Probably 2060 performance @ \\~$200",
      "Because when the time comes in which you will have a choice, you'll want to have reviews ready as a reference available right at that moment - instead of waiting for reviewers to catch up with market situation, leaving potential product customers blind.",
      "Yea and since the RTX 3060 will be based on an entire new and lower tier GPU (GA106) I expect it to not be great value vs the 3060 Ti (GA104). The value kings will probably end up being the 3080, 3060 Ti and 3050 Ti.",
      "I just consider myself very lucky to even have a 3000 series card -3070 to be specific. Complaining over $20, $50, $100 for an item that will give me countless hours of enjoyment is just - sad to be honest. Its an expensive hobby so we have to either deal with it or get a \\*shudders\\* console /s.\n\nComing from a 1070, the performance increase just blew me away and I am sure it will continue to do so with new titles that are coming out in the future - looking at you Cyberpunk :D",
      "exactly...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that the 3080 and 3070 are about equal in perf/euro is crazy bad , especially since they both skew towards high prices (if they were both cheap then sure)",
      "I mean yeah, alright. But if the 3070s only reason to exist is to provide cut-downs for the 3060ti, I'm still not seeing a reason to buy it.",
      "the best card in 2020 is the one you can buy",
      "I'm honestly puzzled as to what our two favourite, much loved GPU manufacturers are thinking sometimes. This nvidia lineup is all over the place even without supply issues and AMD... Well, someone at AMD owes me 10 bucks, put it that way.",
      "The consensus seems to be that it's actually a little faster than a 2080 super",
      "Thats why nvidia was extremely wise to show off the 3070 with the 3080 and 3090, generate excitement, then get as many as they can to pay the extra money and keep the 3070 killer very quiet. There were leaks but this was basically a surprise launch. No teaser or announcement or anything from nvidia. \n\nPeople thought the 3060ti would be shit like the 2060, with no vram or gimped in some way but its really good. Kicks the 5700xt ass for the same price and obliterates amd cards in ray tracing and games that have dlss. This and the 3080 are the value cards of this generation. Just like the 1080ti and the 1060 were with pascal."

If you only care about 1080p, your card is fine.\n\nAs far as a 4080, even at the same price I'd pick the 5070TI, the new tech makes native gaming obsolete, except for some competitive gamers maybe, even that I'm not sure.\n\nEven with DLSS3.5, I hardly ever go native, even if I get the fps I want (I play 144Hz), I still choose DLSSQ, it's just better, smoother, and more importantly, quieter and way cooler with less fps dips.\n\nObviously a 4090 is a whole different level, but it's also more than double the price.",
      "you should get 1440p.",
      "If you got the 8gb 5060 ti you’d spend 1/3 of the amount now to get good 1080p performance and you could buy a 70 class GPU when you decide to upgrade monitors for the same price as the 70 ti you don’t need now. You’re only at 1080p 165hz, spending 1000 on a 750 dollar GPU that you don’t need seems unreasonable to me.",

      "yes",
      "Yes bro. It’s a nice jump",
      "Whats the rest of your specs?\n\n3060 to 5070Ti will be a huge bump but it will also be at the bottleneck of the CPU if you're playing on 1080p as in its not going to utilize it 100% as opposed to say gaming on 1440p/4K. You'll still see improvements overall since the performance is close to/neck and neck with the 4080.\n\n Improvements in streaming? Yes definitely the encoder on the new cards have been improved, they usually improve over time so whether you're using NVENC or the new AV1, 50-series has the latest. Though the biggest jump in my opinion was from 20-series to 30-series when NVENC was still in its infancy though its been improved a lot.\n\nWhen you're playing are you using DLSS? That helps a lot in performance. Even with my system I'm unable to maximize MHWilds and get super high fps, thats just the game, its poorly optimized. Though I would check the other specs if it needs to be improved first.",

      "why would you upgrade to a 5070 ti for 1080p",

      "Yeah honestly this late into the 30 series’ life I would only consider used. Or save for next gen. $650-700 for those are horrible value (the 3080 was originally $700). If you absolutely need a GPU to get your build up and running, go used and flip it down the road, your loss will be minimal since their prices have dropped (vs. buying a new 3070 for $700, then only getting about $350 back for it if you sell it)",
      "It really depends on your budget and future proofing is near impossible as games will scale higher with hardware along the line. I'm not telling you to spend more if you don't want to; if those two cards are the best candidates, then you decide which one's the best. \n\nI'm assuming you're gaming? If you want to sustain 1440p medium-high with a pretty high frame rate for a long time and not just with current games, you could consider paying a bit more for 3080 10GB/12GB or 3080 Ti. Plus DLSS 2 will help tremendously for demanding games. With either card you could probably skip next gen if you don't mind the RT perfomance.",
      "Definitely gaming, and the reports of the 40 series connector pins melting has had me weary of spending the pricepoint on that particular series, but price is not honestly a limiting factor. I was originally aiming for a 3080 12gb or TI and I think this post is solidifying that original stance the more and more I read",
      "Well the 40 Series adapter issue has mostly been solved. Apparently some people weren't plugging in the cable all the way causing it to melt, but at the same time the cable was poorly made to where it's hard to tell if it's seated or not. So you just have to really push it in to make sure it's secured.\n\nSo If say money isn't an issue, then I'm guessing you're willing to buy 40 Series; the 4080 is a good card but it's severely overpriced for the perfomance compared to last gen. If you afford $1200, you can scrape up $400 more for a 4090, which is at least 35-40% faster on average.\n\nIf you don't mind AMD, the 7900 XTX starts at $999 on Dec 13th and the specs of that card and AMD's charts suggest that it's going to be considerably faster than 4080 in raw perfomance, around 10-20%. The Ray tracing perfomance won't be as good, but it'll at least be comparable to 3090 Ti in RT, which is still good, plus you have the aide of FSR 2.1 and FSR 3 next year. But we still have to wait on independent benchmarks for confirmation; non-gaming benchmarks and productivity are still in the air.\n\nSorry if this is too long to read. I'm just trying to weigh your options out.",
      "Not too long of a read at all - it's greatly appreciated! The adapter issue had me the most weary of the 40 series, and I always have a hesitation tied to anything \"New!\" and from my reading, it seems like Nvidia's pricing vs past model performance soured a lot of reviewers along the way with the 40 series. Outside of \"it's loud\" I've been hard pressed to find cons outside of the melting adapters, and I usually game in a room with so much additional background noise that the PC shouldn't be overbearing in the noise pollution realm."

I currently own a 3060 Ti and 8GB VRAM is a deal breaker. I can't run Witcher 3 RT @ 4K DLSS because it's running out of VRAM.\n\nAlso, there is no extra performance with the 3070. The 2080 Ti is just as fast, and it's got a lot more overclocking headroom to boot. As a matter of fact, the overclocked 2080 Ti can outperform not only the 3070, but the 3070 Ti as well.",

You only lose a few FPS going with the 2080ti that won't be that noticable but when a game requires more VRAM for textures or RT, it will be very noticeable.\n\nAlso, you may be better off just getting a 6800 or 6800xt which are sometimes similarly priced to a 3070ti because RT is generally useless due to power/VRAM limitations unless you only plan on play games from 2019.\n\nFor example RE3 with RT stutters constantly due to VRAM limits. Guardians of the Galaxy the card lacks power. Doom Eternal, exceeds VRAM limits, Cyberpunk not enough power, there's a bunch more but I can't recall but don't buy a 3070 for RT.",

At least a 4070 won't handicap you with an old architecture.\n\nRTX 4070 at hypothetical $600 MSRP will be a good purchase. It'll be bought new and therefore have warranty, naturally. It will have 12GB VRAM, DLSS3 Frame Generation and AV1 support as well as double NVENC encoder because it's a 12GB VRAM SKU as per Nvidia's Ada Lovelace White Paper.\n\nIt will additionally have stronger RT support with Shader Execution Reordering, Opacity Micromaps etc. for the occasional game that supports them (admittedly that's the least of your concerns for a xx70 class GPU).\n\nAll these are important factors to consider.",

It is quite free of artifacts but it introduces heavy soap opera effect and I cannot imagine how someone would like that. I would prefer them shooting in 60 fps as well but artificial smoothing like this looks smooth in an unrealistic way. If I were you I would just drop it and care about what‘s actually important on a GPU.\n2. Ray tracing is nice in some games but the performance hit is still pretty big. We will see it optimized in Unreal Engine 5 games so it will be important in future titles and if you want to go for a current gen GPU and want good graphics in AAA titles Nvidia is pretty much the only option. DLSS 2.0 is a game changer and should even be active in Quality mode when not using RT because it‘s just free performance with very good anti-aliasing and looks very good in most games. AMD‘s FSR 2.0 will be closer for sure but that can be applied on all newer graphics cards no matter the brand so with an Nvidia GPU you get all the upscaling techniques from Nvidia, AMD and Intel‘s XeSS as well. Again, easy choice here.\n3. For the results you‘re looking for you should indeed consider at least a 3080 or 3080 Ti. The step up from a 3070 (Ti) to a 3080 is the biggest between two models this generation and for the resolution you are running you‘ll need the 3080 in games like Cyberpunk or Dying Light 2.\n\nHope that helps! :)",

A lot cheaper than both the 6800xt and 3080 whilst still having about 80% of the performance and you get 16gb of vram. \n\nBut if you're interested in ray tracing, its nvidia or nothing, atleast until next gen. I'd say you'd atleast want a 3080 10gb for UW 1440.",

That is why I still haven't sold my 3060 ti. The whole process took me like 8 nerve wrecking hours.\n\nThe switch itself works. The whole mod itself works because most Nvidia BIOSes for the 3070, 3060 ti actually support 16GB VRAM, the switch itself changes the configuration between the two of them on startup. So I have to turn off the PC so that the card has no power at all, flip it, and then start it up. Tbh I will only really use 8GB mode when I detect an error.\n\nBad stuff:\n\nSadly the low power state is a bit broken and that's why I have to force maximum performance on the card, which means an idle consumption of 50 Watts instead of 25Watts, I may edit the BIOS when Editors for that appear (there were rumors of people actually breaking the bios lock on 3000 series cards).\n\nGood stuff:\n\nA bonus is that the 16GB memory ICs themselves are actually faster than the original ones. 16Gbps instead of 14Gbps, I can even OC them to achieve even faster speeds.\n\nTh different speeds do make a difference in FPS, like 5\\~10% more on average. I wanted to have a 16GB Nvidia GPU for a long time, to try out a few more AI tools and play VR games with a higher texture resolutions.\n\nWhen I started half life alyx afterwards the game itself consumed like 10GB to nearly 16GB of VRAM. It did fluctuate so I assume this isn't just allocated but actually used VRAM.\n\nOCCT and some scripts that loaded some AI models into VRAM where also able to access the 16GB without a problem.\n\nEnd:\n\nJust wanted to share it, I originally planned on buying a 4080 but couldn't justify the price. The 4070 with only 12GB feels like a crime for 600€ and the 4060 ti while faster than the 3070 in theoretical performance still costs like 480\\~550€.\n\nI still feel bad for the 330€ spent on the 3070, lol.

      "I really like what HUB has been doing. Nvidia needs to get the message that people aren't happy with its low VRAM strategy. Both players and game devs.\n\nTo anyone who's complaining... keep in mind that nothing bad can come out of this. At worst Nvidia will ignore all the fuss and continue releasing 8gb cards in 2023 and beyond or they will wake up and start putting reasonable amount of VRAM in their cards just like AMD and even Intel have been doing.\n\nVRAM is [cheap](https://twitter.com/Buildzoid1/status/1642672652111282176), there is no reason for Nvidia to continue doing this.",
      "I've had a 3070 for over 2 years now and while I personally never had any issues with it so far there is no denying Nvidia cheaped out on VRAM. It's shocking to see a $500 card capable of performing well but is bottlenecked by VRAM, planned obsolescence as clear as day, they want people to upgrade but I certainly won't.",

Granted I wasn’t very polite in my answers but my points were valid then, and are valid now.\n\nThe 2080 Ti is a demonstration of the real power of the 3070’s silicon, its such a shame to see it held back because of 8 gigs. \n\nI’m still gonna hold on to the card because I’m a cheap bastard, but I’m going AMD or Intel in 2024 when hopefully all of them have a new line of cards that don’t suck for price to performance.",

      "In my opinion 12GB of VRAM for the +1000€ RTX 4070 Ti is ridiculous. It's now barely enough for some titles at 1440p and in couple years it might have similar issues that 8GB cards are facing now. Plenty of power to run games even with RT enabled but not enough VRAM. It's probably planned obsolence from NVidia to force people to buy 5000 series GPU at some point. I'm struggling with my 3070 Ti at 1440p and don't wan't to face the same issue again.\n\nMy choice would be the RX 7900 XT which is slightly cheaper in my country and has 20GB of VRAM. Too bad it's slower with Ray Tracing and FSR doesn't look as good as DLSS. I believe it will still last much longer and you will never have to worry about VRAM usage. And it has plenty of rasterization power.",

Mediocre performance already in a few games I purchased (and I'm not talking just games released in the last 3 months).  I certainly can't go to some of the highest texture settings, and modding has been meh.  Q.Q   This thing was so expensive and I'd just been happy to see stock and wanted EVGA before they were gone.

But, i think having higher frames is just that much more important.\n\n\\*NOTE, I zoomed in for the FPS counter in the pic I posted. So, you're not exactly seeing the highest quality.  Plus compression.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* ALSO, make sure in Nvidia control panel you pick \"DSR FACTORS\" :\n\n2.25X DL, AND Legacy Scaling 4.00x (comes close to looking 4k). For 1440p gaming that is. And if you have 4k monitor you can go higher with this option.\n\nMakes this game look that much better and ofcourse other PC games as well.\n\nSORRY, one more link, just a quick update. I am able to play this game @ 5.2ghz on all cores for my 10700k, usually not going over 58c, avg about 55c.\n\n[https://ibb.co/pRMZZV6](https://ibb.co/pRMZZV6)",

      "The whole point of Nvidia Reflex is to pace your GPU with your CPU. Without it, your GPUs render queue will queue more frames which causes more input latency (provided your CPU is powerful enough). Nvidia Reflex prevents this from happening and is why enabling reflex will ”lower” your framerate by preventing your GPU from hitting 100% load.\n\nIf you're looking for the smoothest and most responsive experience keep it enabled. It's a case where more frames does not mean a better experience.",

      "Gaming is not a need, is a luxury, you can live without gaming but not without eating, so when you cover your priorities is when you can start thinking about gaming, having that in mind counting \"price per frame\" doesn't have much sense, maybe you can be happy that you went cheap and saved money while playing at 30 fps, I can't, it's unnaceptable for me to play beneath 60 frames (and even 60 frames are starting to seem slower when I already play at 120).",

They don’t want their gaming cards replacing quadros in the professional market which is why their VRAM is almost always half what the Quadro equivalent is.

      "Yeah. I had the 3070, noticed to constantly missing VRam and sold it to get a 6800XT\n\nWay better for me and my usecases and the VRam doesn't constantly cry by being overloaded\n\nI would've gladly kept it if it had 12 or even 16 Gigs of VRam.",

      "You're talking as if you're dropping settings from ultra to low. Its a mix of ultra-high. Plus you're even lowering settings and you haven't died. Theres a reason why people are buying 3070 even with 8gb. Because unlike youtubers who put everything on ultra+rt normal people optimize their settings",
      "At least people can't argue that devs should gimp their games because the most popular gpus are 1060s and such anymore.\n\n now that gpus like the 3060 / 3070 are the most popular gpus and they are similar in performance to the current gen consoles. Well the 3060 is roughly equivalent, but the 3070 is a decent bit faster by like 30%.\n\n Anyway, that can be the new baseline for current gen games and ps5 equivalent settings"

In last weeks I got anxious as I see the inflation discussions are not ebbing away and with winter just weeks away I started to worry about the heating. There are some reports in Europe that claim heating will get 50% more expensive in some places than a year ago. So I figured I have some money in the account that is losing value and potential significant increase of the heating bills what could I do? I decided to get another gpu that I keep as heating unit (just for my office) and store of value (just look at second hand gpu markets) while I mine some alt coins in hope I save on heating and maybe win on speculation. I know it’s not fair as so many people can’t get their hands on gpus but I had an opportunity and thought it’s silly not to use it.",

      "Congrats on snagging a GPU! A few recommendations. \n\nFirst, put your RAM in DIMM slots A2 and B2 (2nd and 4th slot). Slots A1 and B1 (1st and 3rd slot) are typically reserved for single channel of the same type, while slots A2 and B2 are typically reserved for dual channel. You are possibly running a single channel configuration with your current RAM configuration being in the 1st and 3rd slot (from what it seems like in the photo).\n\nSecond, it looks like you're daisy chaining your PCI power cable to the GPU. The 3070's TDP is 220W, so you're right on the TDP bubble with your current configuration. The motherboard will provide 75W, and a single PCI power cable is rated for 150W, meaning you can safely provide 225W to your GPU. Whenever playing a demanding game, your GPU may ask for more than 220W, and once you go over 225W, your current configuration can to into the \"danger\" zone, where you may experience instabilities, shut downs, or worst case scenario, fried parts (usually happens with cheap Chinese parts).",

    "selftext": "After months of trying to buy a 30xx series card, my friend in another state that I've known since high school managed to buy me an MSI RTX 3070 for $598 + tax at Best Buy.\n\nHe sent me the new and sealed card.  When I installed it in my computer, all I got were lines all over the screen.  Reseated it multiple times, tried other slots.  It's dead.\n\nBecause Best Buy was sold out of them I decided to RMA it to MSI.  I sent the card in about 6 weeks ago.  Got notice recently that they don't have replacements available and they want to offer me a refund of $475.  $475 what on earth?  Below MSRP for an insanely high demand card!?  I told them I can't accept that and that I paid almost $660 with tax and another $10 to send it to them.\n\nI told them I just want a card and I'm okay with waiting longer.  Also hinted that if they have a RTX 3080 I wouldn't mind upgrading.  They then said they can try to \"compromise\" if I show them the receipt and \\*might\\* be able to refund me for what I paid, but they can't pay for my shipping to send in the defective card.  Unreal.\n\nAnyone have issues like this?  I asked them to escalate this to a manager.  Unacceptable for a manufacturer to be selling cards but not be able to support the defective ones.  Any suggestions for getting this resolve with MSI, anyone I can reach out to?  \n\n\nEDIT:  02/17:  Someone from this forum PM'ed me contact info for a manager at MSI.  I contacted him and a few days later he called me and told me that they can't touch new stock for RMA purposes but he did manage to get me a brand new card that they'll be sending out in a few days.  So hopefully they follow through and soon I'll have this mess behind me.",

If you want your money back, go to the retailer who charged you above msrp. If you want a replacement/fixed card, go to the manufacturer (or retailer).\n\nI agree MSI shouldn’t be offered you less than msrp, but you can’t expect them to offer you more than it either.",

I wanted an Asus 3080 but they have been impossible to get in my area. Even the microcenter near me are only getting 2-3 of them at a time. So I wound up with an MSI 3080 as they were getting dozens of those and EVGA models. I’m happy with it but much would’ve preferred an Asus. My STRIX 970 is still kicking just fine.",

      "EVGA is simply the best. I will say; I had a good experience with Corsair lately. I ordered an HX1200 from Amazon. It was part of a defective series of lots that would cause my pc to power cycle. Call them in the morning and had a new PSU on it's way to me the same day. Returned the old one all shipping billed to Corsair. It's nice when a company does what it's supposed to do.",
      "Exactly why I'm holding out, I will never buy a card from anyone but EVGA. They're literally the best option if you don't want to worry about getting a replacement or dealing with bullshit customer service. Also they have better re-sell value because you can transfer the warranty to second-hand users. You also have the option to pay $50 for a 10-year warranty after their 3-year warranty, which means when it eventually dies, you will basically get a free upgrade. MSI and ASUS have lots of dark stories of their customer service. I will never buy 1 component from them."

      "Go from high to ultra, half fps.",
      "It could make sense that historically, the bar size being limited itself was the bottleneck in some games. The size of available video memory to the CPU was limited, so it wasn't able to send enough data at once for the GPU to really see a use of it.\n\nSo like how if you run out of RAM, it starts to use page file or swap. Just that in this case, the total RAM wasn't the issue just the amount that could he written to at once. Also, instead of writing to disk (page file/swap) it'd probably write that data to system RAM before being sent to VRAM when the available bar was full. So, the performance was still very good, but not as good as it could be. \n\nIn this case, where resizable bar is being used, you could probably notice a single (or multiple) CPU cores with higher usage too.\n\nNow that the GPU has more data to crunch at once, it means that the GPU can be utilized more, and effectively the amount of frames the CPU can push to the GPU is higher.\n\nSo in the cases where the GPU isn't being fully utilized (lower resolutions), the CPU can send more rendered frames (things like rendering polygonal object locations  in space, and the giving the GPU that data to then do graphics rendering on) to the GPU.\n\nThough the negative effect in some cases in interesting. It makes me wonder what's actually going on there.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if overclocking GPU memory while using resizable bar could actually net tangible gains compared to how GPU memory overclocking did little to nothing. Even further, the maximum pre-rendered CPU frames option in Nvidia Control Panel may have a more significant effect.",

Once you compare both architectures at a more reasonable voltage, Ampere pulls further ahead in perf/W; as opposed to comparing them stock-to-stock, where they have almost the same perf/W, suggesting Ampere is tuned more aggressively out of the box than Turing so as to cancel out most of the efficiency gains of TSMC 12 > Samsung 8. I think seeing Ada running at lower voltages is going to be illuminating because I refuse to believe that the perf/W potential of Samsung 8 > TSMC 5 is anything short of significant. By all accounts Samsung 8 is a fairly crummy process (even for its era/technical specs) while TSMC N5 is, expectedly for TSMC, a great quality process. If Ada doesn't have a *substantial* perf/W improvement over Ampere when comparing both architectures at reigned in voltages, you'd have to wonder what went wrong in the engineering department.",
      "Nah, Texas shitty privatized power grid is to blame 🥴",
      "Do that 20 more years and the lowest end card will be 1000w",
      "We know but the jokes help us forget about that 😅",
      "Simply don't buy, that's the only way to force lower power draw for next gen. \n\nNvidia is making GPUs based on statistics, they have now a statistic that there was and is big demand for GPUs that are very powerful and around 300W, so they will target exactly that + try to push that power limit even higher as it is more profitable for them to boost up the clocks than increase silicon amount."

      "As I’ve stated in a different post, until Intel or AMD truly challenge where Quadros dominate, NVIDIA is not going to have their gaming products with the same amount of VRAM as their Professional cards, they are always going to gimp them. It maximizes their profits. AMD honestly loves NVIDIA pricing because they can raise their prices too. If AMD truly cared, they would be pricing cards $100 to $150 less themselves but they won’t because they love money just as much as NVIDIA.\n\nNo corporation is your friend or cares about you. They only care about your money.",
      "We should all hope they succeed.  Nvidia should be giving us sufficient VRAM, particularly when the products are so expensive.",
      "Holy shit... the difference is pretty big. People were claiming that Hogwarts Legacy got fixed, but looks like \"optimization\" just meant not loading textures. Seeing how the consoles have 16GB VRAM with 12GB usable, current gen exclusive games won't run properly on even the 3070ti. Hope the upcoming 4060 8GB & 4050 6GB cards fails so that Nvidia learns a lesson.",
      "They’re really going hard on this VRAM stuff. They’re not wrong either, just a lot of content. Trying to pressure nvidia I guess",
      "People kept saying the games were unoptimized, this just proved that their hardware is low end.\n\nBlame Nvidia for having less than half the VRAM of a console.",
      "Both can be true at the same time tho",
      "All the sudden I want to mod my gfx cards",
      "I think the biggest takeaway from everything is that a lot of games are developed for consoles first. If your GPU has less VRAM than current/next-gen consoles you'll likely run into issues with the latest games.",
      "The 3070 should have had 16gb of ram at launch.",
      "There was a Russian guy a few years ago who modified a 2070 so that it had 16GB of VRAM. I don't remember the details, but he did get slightly better performance after doing that. He desoldered the old VRAM and replaced them with 2GB modules. He also had to create a custom BIOS that would recognize the extra capacity.  \nSo if you're serious about it, you could look that up and give it a try. Please share your results if you do.  \n\nEdit: There was a recent guy who modded a 3070 with 16GB.   \n\nhttps://www.tweaktown.com/news/91194/modded-geforce-rtx-3070-with-16gb-of-vram-shows-impressive-performance-gains/index.html",
      "TL;DW: 90% of people with 3060ti - 3070 are not going to be strongly impacted by VRAM and you’ll just have to lower settings on brand new, massive, AAA games as the card ages. \n\nI really struggle to think of a game that if optimized well for lower end cards, would need more than 8GB of vram occupied constantly. \n\nThat being said, going forward, probably steer clear of low vram models",
      "With this video, it will seal the argument for those who questioned HUB using Radeon as comparison.\n\nStill wanna defend Nvidia for releasing a shitty product? Turing should be the last generation Nvidia can get away with 8GB Vram on a 256bit bus GPU. Nvidia took it way too far with Ampere & still doing it in ADA GPU by shifting SKU up 1-2 tiers.",
      "Journalists keep doing what crap? He's highlighting the fact that NVIDIA has been consistently handicapping their GPU performance by putting as little VRAM on their cards as possible.",
      "I almost got a 3070 a couple of months ago, I'm so glad I didn't now.",
      "Everytime I see these videos I panic thinking 8GB isn't enough then I remember that I primarily only play esports games/multiplayer games then I stop caring again",
      "PC never had and never will get the optimization for ***lower end*** hardware than consoles. Multiple devs stated, if the consoles have X amount of VRAM, PC needs around 2X, because it is not unified and you do not have a special ASIC like consoles, combine with what you want to be higher settings.\n\nThere is the meme asking if you PC is stronger than a console, and a lot of people now are in denial that the answer is No. If you need something 4x better than a console to get 4x the quality, not even a 4090 is close.\n\nNvidia talks with devs, they knew the VRAM requirements.",
      "It was unplayable, the game paused for like a whole second as it ran out of VRAM, and had massive stuttering issues everywhere because it's constantly trying to grab content from outside of VRAM. FPS isn't everything.",
      "The biggest takeaway to me is that cards designed to be good at RT are shit at RT.  Makes the balance between Nvidia and AMD tighter",
      "The problem with \"lowering settings\" is the following: The most effective way of lowering vram usage is using lower res textures. You won't get any performance improvement from that, it just stuff fits into your vram. However, that will be a *huge* visual downgrade. VRAM questions are quite binary, as in you either have enough or dont. Historically there were only some gens where vram was an issue, like maxwell. AMPERE / ADA low-end will be the next gens with such problems. About game \"optimization\" people should realize like 95%+ of games are made for consoles, and later on get ported to pc. When devs designed games for ps4, 8gb vram was enough. Now new games will come designed for ps5. The whole engine is built up on assumptions that there will be 16gb ram (Maybe 12gb or so used for gpu). When someone ports this game to pc, they cannot \"optimize\" it down, as that would require rewriting half of the engine. These engines are not really designed to scale down. So you are right, soonish 8gb will be enough for 1080p low, with atrocious visuals compared to older games.",

Yes, the A12 is near the top, but the only way it pulls ahead is on a heatsink at low RPM, and on a radiator at low*ish* RPM.\n\n\nThey absolutely are great fans, but they're awful value relative to other options and unless you're planning on tossing them on a rad in a config where they'll never be above x RPM, they don't excel in any noteworthy way and actually fall flat at high RPM.",

It's not inherently a *bad* thing as, well, they're fans lol, and their products were ahead for some time - but mindlessly praising and defending them as if they're objectively the best fan in existence and will forever remain that way is absurd.\n\n\n\nThey're the best if you need 120mm fans for a radiator that isn't spewing *too* much heat, but short of that; there are numerous other superior options - some of which are also cheaper.",

We were told the 1080Ti was the last 4K card we'd ever need in 2017. By 2018/2019, it was already struggling with new AAA games. Similarly, 2080Ti performance is already being pushed to its limits (and will only get worse as newer games come out). You can bet the 3080 will be inadequate for 4K gaming by 2022.\n\nI just can't convince myself to invest in the new flagship every 2 years to maintain high fidelity and FPS at 4K.",

ASUS is not the only one, Corsair did it to me with a water block as well but their customer services was infinitely better.",

How much is a 4060 Ti, and 4070 in Vietnamese currency going for now?\n\nYou should try to compare it and explain to them that you will not accept the 4060 Ti and you will only accept a 4070. They have to respect you as a customer and honor their warranty. Check Vietnamese consumer rights if you have any. \n\nIf its possible in your country and you purchased with credit card see if you can get your credit card to assist you with a chargeback case, the creditor will help you through this if ASUS continues to be uncooperative with honoring their product warranty with a respectable service and replacement to you for their product failing and give you your money back possibly so you can choose a new GPU with a different manufacturer that won't short change you with a downgrade replacement. \n\nSome people might say you're getting DLSS 3 and Frame Gen but you paid the price for a 3070 Ti not a 4060 Ti. **They won't even give you the 16 GB variant.** So definitely do not accept this and try to find a way to change their mind or get your money back.",

      "6 months in and the build is finally done! Time for the obligatory post. Under combined CPU and GPU loads - CPU 76C, GPU 59C (both CPU and GPU undervolted via PBO Curve Opt. and Afterburner respectively). Central case temp is 40C and 35C elsewhere.\n\nSome things that I found useful while working in the NR200P:\n\n* The intake from rear + bottom and exhaust via top configuration has worked best for me in this case. It is indeed possible to rotate the Fuma 2 such that a third fan can be placed directly at the rear - however you will need low profile RAM. I'm not sure about compatibility with the finnicky 5xx0 series CPU's but the corsair vengeance might be the answer.\n* Trident RAM will clear the stock Fuma fan in this config by 1mm. It will clear the Noctua by 2mm.\n* Fuma 2 is compatible with the TG.\n* Temps barely change with an upgrade to Noctua fans (1C better) but it does look nicer. On the topic of fans, Arctic PWM PST CO fans work well but they have an annoying 1K rpm whine. I have since gone to all Noctua.\n* The side of the PSU bracket makes it easy to place a temperature sensor to access central case temps (suggestion from a good friend). I like to keep one on the bottom near the GPU too.\n* Demcifilters are nice and barely affect temperatures (1-2C increase). Their NR200P filters are good, though the one for the rear is both too narrow and short. Overall the reduction in dust has been worth it.\n* Commander Pro can be mounted in the 2nd hard drive bay at the front. Wires can be routed through the front and then back into the main case to tidy things up.\n* It's a really straightforward and easy build.  \n\n\nEDIT: Since it came up the CPU temp is with PBO boost enabled, not running stock. Stock temps under load are close to 50-60 C.",
      "I can't believe it's not butter\n\nThat's a nice looking rig, kudos.",

I went from a NZXT 500 to a Meshify  to a NR200 and guess what? Thermally, it cools as well as the Meshify, while taking up less than half the size. ATX is dead to me.",

      "Honestly at this point, I'm willing to wait to see what AMD comes out with. If the 3080's had actually been available, I'd have one right now. Now that we're this close to the AMD announcement and people are still competing to get a card within 2 minutes after a restock, i might as well wait. If their cards don't appeal to me then maybe I'll have a 3 minute window for the 3080. If they do appeal to me then I'm glad I didn't participate in this dumpster fire of a project launch.\n\n\n\nI know I'm not the only one that feels this way. Nvidia fudged this launch so badly that we're now in \"wait and see\" mode when we would have all gladly spent the money on a fantastic card if they had had the foresight to provide for even a fraction of the insane demand."

That was always pretty-much the case, but now it seems like new tech isn't even an option for the wealthy or the obsessed. And then after a few years and even the newest tech isn't available in any meaningful way for a casual consumer like myself.\n\nSomething tells me if this doesn't shift, the whole industry is going to have to shift away from \"SUPER UBER GRAPHICS/Lighting/Shading\" to more optimized and consumer (\"do not use uber-hardware for our game it is a waste\") friendly. Feels like companies are able to optimize their games but they want to be able to \"push the new technology\" and so they consider older tech as obsolete and therefore not functional.\n\nedit - jeez, for the person who downvoted me,  I would be interested to hear the reason.

      "Well they're also going to sell the 3050 Ti as a GA106 die with 3072 CUDA Cores which is around two GPC's in total, this is the same die that they use for the 3060 and 3060 LHR, except those dies have more GPC's available to use because they're not as cut down. Whereas the RTX 3050 is going to be GA107, with around 1.5 GPC's, so 2304 CUDA Cores. \n\nIf your theory is right, they wouldn't bother to sell a lower level part with a better die, they could easily sell a full GA107 die as the 3050 Ti with the full two GPC's, like they're going to do with the 3090 Ti and it's full 7 GPC's. Even something as simple as the 3060 Ti could have been a full GA106 die with 3 GPC's, with 4608 CUDA Cores, that's not a crazy difference compared to the 4864 CUDA Cores it currently ships with, but obviously the supply is much better with GA104 for 3060 Ti.\n\nSo in summary, the yields are just better to cut down a larger die like GA104 or GA106 compared to full GA107 die performance and thus your whole argument of selling a larger die for an extra price falls apart. I can tell you now, there's going to be a lot of potential 3060's that are now going to be 3050 Ti's just to meet demand from customers who are looking for a smaller GPU, not to mention that it should be cheaper due to lower VRAM even if the die's the same, we're talking 8GB vs 12GB.",

However, I recently learned of the melting cables problem with 40 and 5090s. Knowing this will be a prebuilt, should I be worried? Should I go with the 4090 instead to lower risk or go all in assuming price wasn't an issue? All the extra fps and performance from the 5090 would be useless if it catches fire and I personally don't want to risk damaging a fresh new pc considering how expensive it is.\n\nBasically in short, should I get a 4090 to be safer or a 5090 to get maximum value? I have a 240hz 4k OLED monitor and average competitive shooters, but I also like quality and I do plan on playing single player games. If I were to get the 5090, would there be any way to alleviate the problem at hand? As I know the risk will always be there.\n\nI've seen people own the 4090 for years no issues, and people who owned the 5090 on release no issues.

If that annoys you, then no it is not worth it.\n\n  \nIn regards to 4090 vs 5090; there isn't a world where I would get a 4090 over a 5090 with current pricing.

      "Wow a 3070 won’t run max settings ray tracing on 2077 🤯 …. I am just telling OP the wise move not the one he wants to hear. In the mean time assuming his pc was built the same time the 3070 was release he could upgrade his ram cpu etc….",
      "I'm on an RTX 3080 and after playing cyberpunk 2077 with path tracing and the fsr 3 frame gen mod, I felt the same way, especially with my 12400F. However, I don't see many other games coming out in 2024 with path tracing, and I think it's very likely that the 5000 series will double down on improving path tracing performance - be it via hardware or arbitrary soft locks - so I'd wait if I were you.\n\nIn the meantime, why not give the mod a go. Just run the game on dlss balanced and medium graphics. Image quality suffers but I found myself connecting more with the world and characters with path tracing on. \n\nI do think that Path Tracing is the future though, and next gen consoles will launch the moment that tech can fit within a $499 / $599 price point. My guess is 2027.",
      "I don’t know about frame gen to be honest.\n\nI have a 4k monitor, and when I put on frame gen and dlss quality, it just looks like dlss performance to me.  And you can’t manually turn on Vsync when in frame gen.\n\nRay Reconstruction truly is next level though.\n\nOP, it really depends on how long you can wait.  Even the 4090 struggles with Cyberpunk 2077 max everything 4k RT.  I’d wait for the 50 series.",
      "Clearly it’s an upgrade, there would be no 4000 series if it wasn’t… but I wouldn’t say to him it’s a warranted upgrade and should just hold out the year for even better cards as his is still functioning fairly decent.",
      "While I do agree that Nvidia is greedy like the other replies, it’s important to remember that Nvidia’s proprietary frame gen requires a specific hardware upgrade introduced in the 4xxx series, namely the larger optical flow accelerator I believe.",

      "OP mentioned wanting to use Ray Tracing at 1440p. At max settings, the card WILL struggle on a 3070. Upgrading to a 4080 Super will fix his problem so no, you're wrong.",

She has decided on a mini ITX build, which I totally understand, but that leaves her with $500 to spend on a GPU. Right now I am wondering if we should buy her a new card, or if I should give her my current card (ROG 3070) and just upgrade my own. I could use an upgrade as the games I play are a lot more intensive and my projects (video editing and rendering) are starting to get a lot more demanding. However, I don't want to spend more than $1000 on a card, which could get me a 3090 or a 4080. She plays games that are mildly demanding like CS, Halo, COD, and mainly the SIMS which I know the 3070 can easily handle, but so could a cheaper card. \n\nSo idk do I get her a new, cheaper card like a 3060 or spend a little extra money and upgrade my own.\n\n",

I actually play in 4k and also edit in 4k, which is why I opted for a 4080, since I only upgrade when I feel it's necessary.",

I can run Cyberpunk at 35-40 FPS at ultra settings 1440p with RT??? What is this!\n\nLike, I am so astounded. I am actually able to get 50 FPS in RDR2, fully maxed out (so including all the particle effects, volumetrics etc. at 1440p), and without DLSS, at 1440p! Holy fuck?????

Is it correct that the 3070 should be able to run the game at 35-40 fps 1440p with RT? Or is something glitched out and I should be getting less but something isn't rendering properly or something? I have tested it out and I can totally tell the difference between RT on and off?\n\nLike I just wanted to share that I am so happy I can now play at 1440p respectably?

Some of the ultra settings in RDR2 are way too intensive for the minimal difference they make to the average player.",

      "I had a similar experience recently with a AMD card. I know this is the end video subreddit but hear me out. \n\nI have a older brother who owns a phone repair and electronic repair shop and also works for a company that repairs electronic boards that you just can't get anymore mainly on industrial equipment. and weird little things you would never expect \n\nI bought a broken RX 6800 off the web for $50. we stole a bunch of parts from a donor card and we got it working just fine like it was out of the box \n\npersonally I've bought high-end hardware year after year for over 30 years now. it was my first experience with a mid-range card ever in my life and not to mention a previous generation card. I bought a 7900XTX this time around and last gen I had a 3090. That machine now lives in one of children's bedrooms \n\nthat video card was wildly impressive. I was even able to get away with some 4K gaming. and it shifted my perspective massively. \n\nwe did pay it forward and hooked one of my youngest son's friends up with a brand new gaming PC composed of that RX6800 and a ryzen 5 7600 CPU. now every time I see my son playing one of his games and I see his friends character on the screen I get to relish in the good feelings of helping a kid out who otherwise would not have gotten that PC. He's a good kid he deserves it. always helpful, very polite, well spoken young man \n\nanyway when I look at my Main PC with a 4090 or my Sim Rig with a 7900XTX I wonder if their slower offerings would have impacted my experience negatively overall. \n\nbe happy with what you have and chasing that number gets exhausting after a while. I don't know if I'm going to buy anything from the 5000 series or 8,000 series cards set to come out here soon. but knowing me I'll find an excuse to build a new system, at least somebody else gets my old system for free lol.\n\n3070 is a killer card and there's a few settings you can disable in those games that are kind of useless anyway with very little visual sacrifice \n\nenjoy my friend",

Still a hell of a lot better than a 2060.",

      "It's a shame because the 5700x3d was on a massive sale like a month ago. I got one for like a hundred bucks or something on Amazon. And I picked up a used 3070 for like 200 locally. Huge cost effective upgrade for me.",
      "I had a 3070ti and just upgraded to a 4070ti super and i went from 1440p at low at 90fps to 1440p at ultra with 130 fps in cod, that being said, i think a 3070 is good enough for what you’re trying to do especially if you play single player games because you won’t see any negatives to using DLSS. In short, you will be able to see 60fps in most games at medium setting at 1440p. In 2/3 years it might become outdated, but for single player games I think you made a good upgrade. If you could, I’d upgrade to a 7900xt if you can get it for 600$ this Black Friday so you won’t need to upgrade long term",
      "Not trying to hate or anything congrats on the upgrade, I just don't know why people are obsessed with ultra settings just use the optimized settings (Best visuals without sacrificing FPS) and you are good to go, and about your CPU try getting R5 5600 it will handle 1440p just fine with your GPU cheers!",

      "> With the \"just wait until\" mentality they may as well wait forever because there's always something better around the corner.\n\nWhile that as true, it should also be obvious that the distance from here to that corner varies depending on when you make that statement.  The 4080 Super is \"right around the corner\" (5 days), the RTX 5000-series GPUs are \"right around the corner\" (10-12 months), and the RTX 6000-series are less \"right around the corner\" at probably 4+ years.  Depending on how well he can tweak his current card, he might be fine waiting 10-12 months.  He could turn down the resolution, or the detail level.  He might try one of the AMD Framegen on nVidia driver hacks to hold him over.  Or he may just decide to buy now.\n\nThis also might depend on the financial situation.  I paid $1100 for my 3080 shortly after launch, during the shortage.  That was a very hard pill to swallow, and several hundred more than I intended to spend.  But the 4080 launched at $1200 and went up from there.  If I wait for the RTX 5000 stuff to launch I might be able to get a 5080 for $1300-$1400, if I were willing to pay that much for it.  But if I were feeling performance issues today, I might be tempted to buy a 4070ti Super for $800 now to hold me over for another 3 years or so.  God knows I won't be buying any GPUs in October-December time frame because that's the holiday season and my spending is focused on the kids at that point, so if I do decide to wait for RTX 5000 then I'm at least a year away, likely more.  Maybe I'd wait a few weeks for them to start showing up at Microcenter as \"Open Box\" for $720.  I've already seen a few \"Open Box\" 4070 Supers go through this week.\n\nI really miss EVGA and their upgrade program.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!  \n\n\nI currently am using MSI RTX 3070Ti Gaming X with 1440p @ 144hz. Should I upgrade it to 4070 Super?  \n\n\nThe things that caught my attention:  \n\n\n\\- Lower Power Consumption  \n\\- 4GB extra VRAM (although I wish it was 16GB)  \n\\- Smaller Design  \n\\- DLSS FG  \n\\- Overall better performance? How much % on average  \n\n\nPlease let me know what you guys think.",

      "3070ti 1440 180hz here. Make sure to try the AMD frame generation mod first. It's easy and works really well. Allows you to turn on FG in games as though you have a 40xx card.\n\nIt's called dlssg-to-fsr3.",
      "It’s not worth it, wait until the 5000 series come",
      "Hmmm, i don't think its worth it.  \n\n\nBut if you want upgrade so bad then wait for the other Super cards, especially 4070 Ti-S, would be a nice value and regular one probably will drop the price.",
      "No, what the fuck. Don't go pissing money away to these companies by upgrading so frequently. Let your high end PC hardware last 5+ years.",
      "First I’m hearing this.. thanks!",
      "No. 3070 Ti will keep up with modern games for years.",
      "I don’t think so. It’s pretty much on par with a 3090. 4070 Tisuper a much smarter option with 16gig and will be basically a slightly cutdown 4080",
      "1. Can OP afford it and future upgrades whenever they want? If so, sure.\n2. If OP is the kind of person to hold and use a GPU for 4 years each time, no. Always skip the next generation, and wait until the post generation's prices have gone down.",
      "for 12% performance increase? not worth it imo. If you are coming from a 2xxx, it might be",
      "It's not worth it for the tiny increase, wait for the Next Generation! 👍🏻",
      "I second this, the 5070 or 5060 are about a year away, and the 3070ti should be more than enough for games now on 1440p until you can get one of those. Unless you have something that specifically isn't playing like you want, I don't see the need for an upgrade now.",
      "no, usually triggers anti-cheat.  thats kind of the only reason to consider moving to a 40xx.  i use it on cyberpunk and now get like 130+ fps on high/ultra settings with RT.... its awesome.  lag isnt an issue.  really makes the decision to upgrade from my 3070 to a 40xx hard now",
      "I've been considering buying a 4070 super (coming from a 3070) since I play on 3440x1440. Gonna definitely check this out.",
      "TL;DR summary:\n\n* Only for Nvidia RTX cards (20\\* and 30\\*) and games that support frame gen - use **dlssg-to-fsr3**.\n* For any cards and for some games that don't even support frame gen - use **LukeFZ FSR2FSR3** mod (paid, but leaked online). This mod did wonders to Ready Or Not game - doubled FPS on my RTX 2080Ti without noticeable input latency.",
      "You really shouldn't treat FG as real FPS. It's a \"boost\" that works if you have a lot (60+) of frames already. If you have 30-40 it works but you begin to question if using it is better or worse than native. Below that value it's pointless and won't make unplayable games playable.",
      "Agreed, i went from 2080 TI that just now bricked and got the 4070 super. Had my 2080 TI not gone and unalived itself, I would have continued using it till the 5000 series released.",
      "Look up optimized settings for hogwards. It should end up looking exactly like ultra but running much better.\n\nAgree that 8gb is a limit but try optimizing FC6 settings too. reducing shadow maps can claw back vram. turning that games mediocre RT off can as well, without visual impact.",
      "Search nukem dlss fg on google. Download the mod from nexus. Copy paste some files in game folder. Run the reg to disable nvidia checks. If you have 60fps in cyberpunk it will easily reach 100-110 fps.",
      "You’re over thinking man. \nPlenty of people go into engineering, consulting, finance or law relatively young with no children and start at those rates.\n\nGaming is diverse :) disposable income or families is obviously going to range drastically. \n\nLet’s enjoy our hobby collectively and let people buy what they want.",

I could actually saturate all that framerate headroom way more often without having to reduce settings very much or at all, depending on the game. If you are okay spending the money for the horsepower, it should feel like a substantial jump to most people. Also -anecdotally- framegen feels like black magic.",
      "Not for that resolution. You should really consider investing in 1440p 240hz.",
      "I have a Ryzen 7 5800x, and yea, that’s a good idea tho",
      "Not a bad suggestion either.  The 70tiS and the 80S are nearly identical.  The only differences are the 80's have 1800ish more Cuda cores and some of the 70's are actually clocked faster",

    "title": "Small beginner's undervolting guide for rtx 3070 FE",
    "selftext": "I managed to get the 3070 FE, and I have to say that coming from a 1070 (gainward phoenix), the noise/temps are really quite disappointing considering all the reviews, which mostly praised the low noise. It has 0 fan mode for idle, when not idle it spins at 30% minimum which is 1000 rpm, which is very quiet.\nAfter that, it starts to be noticeable at 1200 rpm, and by 1600 it's very audible. \nConsidering it will go to around 1800rpm in games at unlocked framerates, one needs to do something if a quiet PC is the goal, and this is where undervolting comes to the rescue.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCurrently, modifying the fan curve in afterburner seems to result in loss of 0 fan mode, which I hope is a bug that will be fixed (edit: afterburner 4.6.3 beta2 solved this issue, so use that or a newer version, EDIT2: actually, the issue is solved because the custom fan curve isn't taken in consideration, in this version you are just stuck at default no matter what).\n\nIs is pretty much like the 3080 guides, but I find most of them, at least the written ones, not that clear.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is meant as a complete beginner's guide, so please point out if something wasn't properly explained. Also use the images included at the end to get an idea where everything is in the interface.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo one needs MSI Afterburner, in the pictures I have I used the skin called 'a touch of modern', which you can select in settings.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n - First press Press Ctrl+F and see the default frequency/voltage curve. This curve should probably look like mine (for the FE at least), but some say that it will shift up and down depending on temperature (I have not seen this, no matter what I did, maybe something changed in newer afterbuner). You should do this at idle just to be sure. Link to my defaults: https://imgur.com/arN3zk6\n\n&nbsp;\n\n - Then in the main afterburner window drag the core clocks to minus 200mhz, and press apply (the 'tick' on the down-left corner), and the whole curve will shift down. The actual value you need to put here is to make the top right of the graph go under 1800 mhz (by a little), in case your graph doesn't match mine. So in my case it was -200 (because my uppermost part went to 2000 mhz). 1800 is about the sweet spot to lose very little performance . Image that shows where is what: https://imgur.com/Of1jLlJ\n\n(much later EDIT: at least 1800 is the sweet spot on my card, now after looking at more people's results, I would say a better way is to go by voltage, and try to squeeze as much as possible from 850mV, most people get from 1800 to 1900 mhz at that value))\n\n&nbsp;\n\n - Now put memory +1000 in main interface and press apply. In techpowerup's reviews, all the various 3070 versions they had could go at least +1000, so it should be a safe value but at the limit, so keep in mind that it may need lowering if you just can't achieve stability in the later steps. This is an optional step if you want to gain a little bit of performance back, but if you don't like the idea of overclocking, just leave it at 0.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- In the voltage/frequency window (the one that opens with ctrl+f), click the little dot that corresponds to 850mV, and drag it up to 1800 mhz (you can also use the up/down keys on the keyboard to fine tune) (https://imgur.com/2AtjXh2). Press apply. That's it, you can close the freq/voltage window and minimize afterburner (this is how mine looks after apply: https://imgur.com/7EHOMUY).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTest stability using time spy demo (not benchmark), which I find to be quite sensitive to instability (it will just stop prematurely if there are problems). A loop of 10+ minutes of unigine heaven or supeposition is also pretty good at this. For me, the most sensitive ultimate test I found was metro exodus, maxed with raytracing at ultra, and playing for about 10 minutes (raytracing enabled will put more stress on the gpu).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese values have been stable for me, but maybe you can squeeze more, (850mV to 1900mhz for example), or maybe less, depends on how lucky you were with the card. Based on numbers from reviews, mine seems worse than all of theirs, so do try more aggressive values.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo with these settings I got 13400 in time spy graphics score, instead of 13500 on default, so almost a match (the average clocks in default were fluctuating around 1880, now it's locked 1800 but higher memory clocks). Power in time spy went from 220w to 170-180w, so a decent amount lower, and temps about 7-8 C lower, which made the fans spin much lower, 1400rpm at most instead of 1800 (very big difference in noise).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne can be even more efficient going lower, losing more performance. One good value is 1700 mhz. Reduce clocks to -100 more than what you used before (for me -300 instead of -200). Drag the 800mV to 1700 mhz, hit apply. And test around those values for stability. This will give around 150w max at about 12800 score in time spy, so same power as a gtx1070 from 4 years ago, but 2x the framerates.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome more tips on afterburner:\n\n- you can save the settings to up to 5 presets, on the right of the interface, so you can make a higher and lower power presets to switch to.\n\n- if you messed up the curve or whatever, reset everything to default pressing the little icon above the apply button (core clocks and memory will also be reset, so don't forget about them).\n\n- the curve to the right of the point you drag up and hit apply needs to be completely straight. If it's not, you needed to lower the core clocks more in the beginning, reset and redo.\n\n&nbsp;",

I was very dissapointed in the thermals of this card and now im absolutely loving it.",
      "That is a very good result.",
      "In theory it sounds great and I have tested this extensively since it makes sense. \n\nThe problem is the power cap doesn't put a cap to the clocks, and in certain scenarios, where the card requires less power per clock, the card will boost higher and reach unstable freq\\voltage points (or those clocks will just not be as high to maintain stability). In other words, you can have a bit better fps for your power with capping.\n\nLet's say for my card I have +200 mhz at 1800 and it's capped there, which gives me 80% max power in the worst spot of time spy. If I put the whole curve at +200, and cap the power to 80, I will reach instability in certain scenarios, because the points to the right of 1800 can't do +200 (and they will get there in somewhat lighter situations, like the beginning of time spy). So the performance in most intensive moments, when I really need it, will be lower at the same power. So the capping is really about fine tuning one point, if that point keeps moving, you cannot fine tune it as well anymore.",
      "Ok, this is amazing. I have an EVGA 3070 XC3 Ultra gaming.\nWith your guide I managed 1850 mHz @ 0.85V with Memory at +1000. \nTime spy score increased from 13668 to 13763.\nTemperature decreased from 70C to 61C. \nFan speed decreased from 1800 rpm to 1500 rpm.\nPower draw went down to 150 watts. \n\nIts stable in Cyberpunk on max settings with RT on ultra.\n\nThank you so much!",

Now it's barely hitting 68 degrees and the I've set the fans to stay at 40% from 55 degrees to 75 degrees. It's basically silent, also I was able to push mine to 1900mhz at 850mv without any issues.",
      "thank a bunch man. Starting from your guide, my 3080 Vision OC, ended up with 0.875/1900mhz, almost the same time spy score vs stock at around -150w!",
      "hi thanks for the guide, i undervolt my 3070 MSI Ventus 3x, i got the card stable at 1845mhz@0.819V. Watt down from max 220W to max 165W, card temperature down from max 68c to max 61c. GPU fan max 1000RPM, so basically silent.\n\nand all that just with 3 FPS drop on Microsoft Flight Simulator.\n\nlove this!",
      "I'm new to undervolting so maybe I missing something here so I hope someone can help me understand.\n\nAs I understand it the point of undervolting is to reduce temps to get as much core clocks for the least voltage possible right?\n\nSo I get the whole idea of capping the higher clocks and testing how low of a voltage we can get them to run at. That makes sense.\n\nWhat confuses me it the first thing you did when you reduce the core clocks of every node down 200 mhz [https://imgur.com/Of1jLlJ](https://imgur.com/Of1jLlJ). Aren't you now basically telling the GPU to load the low clocks at a higher voltage than they were before, which is the opposite of what we want, no?\n\nFor example if I zoom in [https://imgur.com/a/N8gUgtr](https://imgur.com/a/N8gUgtr) the GPU originally had it set to pushing 1400 clocks at 775 mV (the green x) but shifting everything down now has it pushing only 1200 clocks at 775 mV (the red x).\n\nFollowing this pattern all the lower node points have more volts going into less clocks.\n\nMaybe I'm completely wrong here but could someone clarify why we need to do this?",
      "Just did this to my 3070 Ultra i got today.\n\n1815 MHz @ 850 mV and +1000 memory OC\n\nSuperposition default was 8756\n\nUnderclock/volt was 8531\n\nWent from ~240W down to about ~170-180W\n\nPretty good drop in power with little performance impact.",
      "Thanks for this guide man! Ive successful got an undervolt at 0.925, clock of 1995mhz and memclock of +1000 - ive not done a full suite of testing but a couple of time spy runs done and no issues, gpu score was 14450!\n\nHit max temp of 70°c while being fairly quiet!",
      "upped to 1920mhz with same voltage, still stable in timespy"

      "Man if that 3080 Ti is real, I'm so in. Price is going to be absurd but that will likely be at least a full 100% performance increase between shader count and architecture improvements over a 2080 Ti. Quadruple the RT cores as well and double the tensors, so RT performance would be dramatically better.\n\nSo I absolutely do not believe that's happening, but a man can dream.",
      "It's going to be a nice upgrade for us on our 1080ti's still though.\n\nGot mine april of 2017 and I'm ready for more frames as games are hitting pretty hard at 1440p ultra.\n\nHad to turn down some stuff just to get RDR2 to do around 70 fps. I'm still too used to doing 100+ and this is too soon for nearing 60!",
      ">The most interesting part is obviously the specs, where a 3070 could be  close in performance to an RTX 2080 Ti. So the shader counts seems hmm,  let's call it far-fetched and too enthusiastic?\n\nWhy would that be far-fetched? the xx70 always matched the performance of the previous generation's xx80Ti card. That is, until Turing. If Nvidia wants to make marginal performance leaps the norm, they will completely erode their competitive lead over AMD. They could afford to be lazy with Turing because AMD was so far behind they weren't a threat, but with RDNA, they can quickly close the gap.",

It's going to show leaps and bounds better performance than the 20 series, the same as the 10 series was over the 9 series. Prepare for another massive improvement in performance, and hopefully with competition from the new consoles and maybe a new series from AMD, we'll see a trend back towards reasonable prices. Can't wait to finally have a real successor to this aging 1080 Ti that I can replace it with.",

The 970 was a $350 GPU in 2014 that was like 2013's $700 GPU but with 1GB (.5GB haha) more VRAM.\n\nSo it took one year for a ~$310 or ~46% drop + improvement in the two generations preceding Turing.  But Turing took 2 years for a $200 or 29% price drop.  And Maxwell used the same node as Kepler so you can't just go \"well there was a node drop that really helped!\" since... even Turing had some node improvement over Pascal.",

Was kinda hoping the 1080ti could last 5 years but I'm not too shocked it's getting its butt kicked in some games just 3 years later.\n\nI'll buy myself the 3080ti then give my 1080ti to my cousin for free, but I'll only give it to him if he dumps that crappy fx 8350 processor and dd3 ram for at least a ryzen 3000 series chip, ha!"

I have been googling a lot however I found a lot of \"buts\", the 3070 seems quite a bit more powerful with like 10-20% more FPS, but the 4060 has the new DLSS3 frame generation pushing its fps all the way to rtx 3080 level, but there is apparently an input lag issue with dlss3, but nvidia reflex seems to solve it? I am quite lost here, if I want to play modern games in QHD resolution with the best quality possible at around 60FPS, does 4060 with DLSS 3 provide better experience than RTX 3070 with DLSS 2? Are there other things to consider? \n\nI will probably buy a 34\" ultrawide QHD monitor, but I havent made my final decision, would you also choose such monitor for best gaming experience if you had $300-400 to spend just for the monitor (plus $600 for the pc so $1000 limit for the whole setup, I really dont think I want to spend $200-300 more for RTX 4060ti or rtx4070 as the FPS with rtx4060 seems high enough for most modern games in QHD)? \n\nThanks a lot for your advice.",

      "What games can a 3070 not run? Personally the only games I've ever experienced issues with were a handful of VR titles. Everything else ran fine.",
      "The 4060ti also comes in a 8GB model which performs almost identically to the 3070.",
      "I traded my boys 3070 for a 2080ti due to Racket and Clank rift apart. If you didn’t play on low setting or Performance mode upscaling the game was almost unplayable due to the stuttering from a lack of VRAM. Plays fine now with all settings maxed out with DLSS quality.",
      "Yep. 4060ti uses 160W. 3070 uses 220W. Some 3070s have a power limit of 250W",
      "I don’t know if this helps but I have both 4060 and 3070 Ti. Games that support frame gen (let’s use Diablo 4) vs 3070 ti:\n\nUltra settings (1440p) / Raytracing OFF\nFrame Gen and DLSS (balanced) ON\n\n4060 (85W) 117-148 FPS\n\n3070 Ti (140W) 131-170 FPS (no frame gen support)\n\nOf course, this is paired with a 12700H (for 3070 Ti) versus 13620H (4060)\n\n\nAnother game: Assassin creed Valhalla:\n\nUltra settings / FSR ON\n\n4060 67-75 FPS\n\n3070 Ti 85-112 FPS\n\n\nIn general 30 series will have better raw power but it all depends on the watt variant of the 4060 to make it worth buying over a 3070 let’s say. They both support DLSS except frame generation is only on 40 series.\n\nInput lag is there and when frame gen is on, it feels floaty, almost like you aren’t playing the game during  frame loading? Hard to explain but latency is definitely there and idk feels off at least on diablo 4",

The 3070 can still get *decent* performance and visuals in games with DLSS, but I would not personally recommend it to someone looking for a GPU to last a few years at 1440p because of the VRAM issue, which I've ran into in games like Horizon Forbidden West and others. I wouldn't recommend an 8GB GPU full stop to anyone with a 3440x1440 display honestly, not unless that person was exclusively going to play smaller, less demanding games or old games anyway.\n\nAlso FSR3.1 support, which is needed for FSR FG + DLSS is not widespread still and the FSR3 FG mod, in my experience, is a bit dodgy with frame times in about half the games I've tried it in.",

It physically can’t run stalker 2 above 5fps if you play at higher resolutions.\n\nIt’s doable if you don’t care for higher refresh rates or ray tracing and you don’t mind using dlss",

      "4080 super is more expensive than my total budget, I dont really need that much more performance mainly because I will still keep using Geforce now service in case there is a game where 4080 super is well worth it, i just want to have a home machine for those games that cant be played remotely like the new Portal 2 RTX. When I checked reviews, 4060 seemed to deliver good enough performance in 2K resolution, many games need DLSS but I dont consider that a negative. I feel like we live in an era where even midrange gpus are powerful enough to run any game on high settings, and you need high end gpu only if you really want to max out the graphics with 4k resolution, raytracing or path tracing, no DLSS or only DLSS quality etc. I remember times when even the high end gpus werent enough to run a game on full details with anti-aliasing, mainly around the Crysis 1 release (8800 ultra and then 9800gtx), I remember the most powerful gpu from nvidia had like 40 FPS there and it took 2 generations of new gpus to comfortably have 80-100 FPS with 60 min FPS. And if I have to set the details to medium in a year or 2, so be it, as long as i can still run the game decently at 60 FPS. If not I will consider selling the 4060/3070 for $150-200 (or whatever it will sell for used in 1-2 years) and upgrade to something like 4070 or maybe even 5070.",
      "i see a lot of people recommending amd, but that is currently not an option for me as one of the games I want to play is Portal 1 and 2 with the new sick looking RTX graphics upgrade package mod, and it is not compatible with amd cards unfortunately. But even if I didnt care about Portal, isnt nvidia gpus just straight up better than amd (for the same price) with all \"helpers and improvers\" enabled like DLSS, raytraing, reflex etc? \n\nAMD seems to have good base rasterization performance, but its ray tracing and dlss equivalent technology is crap no? I remember seeing a grap where enabling raytracing loses like 70% of FPS, and their DLSS tech doesnt improve fps as much as nvidia and looks worse no? I play to use every available tech to my advantage, I will definitely have DLSS enabled, probably frame generation as well unless it looks or behaves worse somehow, I definitely want to have raytracing enabled in games as the difference in scene lighting is absolutely magnificent (especially with wet/shiny surfaces, glass, mirrors and water.        \n\nAMD also has 12GB or 16GB of vram, but I have no idea how that translates to games and future performance, 8GB vram seems fine right now, and I assume that if it isnt enough in 2-3 years, I will just play with slightly less detailed textures or I will be forced to lower resolution to fullhd. is 8gb of ram really such a big deal as a lot of people seem to think?",
      "4060 with FG will at the most match 3070 in real frames. Besides the latency I don’t like the extra smoothness it adds to the image in games. That will be even more noticeable in 1080p.\n\nBesides, I don’t think 4060’s 8GB buffer can keep up with FG demands in newer titles anymore. Especially not at 3440*1440, even with DLSS."

That's a lot of extra power and heat you're generating for a somewhat disappointing performance increase. If you have sufficient cooling and decent ambient room temps, Ti is worth considering.

It requires more VRAM and introduces input lag.\n\nAlso, at a limited budget, you will probably find better deals with an AMD card unless you absolutely refuse to use AMD / absolutely must have nVidia features. If OK with used, that budget could get you an RX 6800 XT used, which outright destroys both of those cards.",

The prices are so crazy that there really is no logical solution.\n\nI think the best combo (without spending 2k€) is the 5070ti for 1440p but I still see it too expensive for the upgrade range."

Also I don't know if I would be missing something from the 50 series other than Multi FrameGen.\n\nMy use case would be AAA gaming at 1440p medium to high settings and a little bit of RT here and there. My goal would be reaching 120fps mixed settings and FrameGen if needed (I currently often do 60fps cap + lossless scaling to 120 so latency isn't a deal breaker for me).\n\nI'd like to know what you think and any suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nEveryone have a great day!

      "Tbh it sounds like you're still having a lot of fun with your 3070. It's still a great card to begin with!",
      "I'm holding on to my 3070 until I see reviews of the 5080, 5070ti, and 9070xt. Everything runs well enough right now so it's not like anything I want to play is chugging.",
      "A used 3090 ti is a bad choice for anyone not doing AI work IMO. It is exceptionally power hungry, prone to stability issues due to overheating, the price is kept reasonably high due to it having the 24 GB VRAM that helps it in AI workloads + if it has any warranty left it will be very little. I'd leave it to anyone who knows they need the VRAM at a reasonable price.\n\nThe 4070 ti super is faster than it for gaming and the 16 GB VRAM will last about as long as the card has enough compute power to run your games. I'd wait for benchmarks to decide between it and the 5070, but the 4070 ti super is likely to be the better card in anything except multiframe-generation.",
      "As another 3070-haver, I'm waiting at least another generation.\n\nI have high suspicions that 12GB of VRAM for the next-gen PS6/Xbox-Whatever in a couple years will probably run you into the exact same walls you're hitting now for 8GB.\n\nNvidia is currently gating >12GB of VRAM behind a $750 paywall.  Coming from a <$200 1060, even $500 felt stupid-expensive for what I have now.  So, I'm waiting for something that at least doubles my current rasterization performance, and isn't too much over $500.",
      "Everyone will say wait for reviews, which you should definitely wait on!\n\nWith me rubbing my crystal ball, I would say 5070 would probably be your best bet. It will perform about the same as the 4070ti super. Both cards perform worse than the 3090ti, but the 3090ti is a bit dated. I think jumping up to newer gen would be nice if you’re going to upgrade. Frame gen is okay. I use it depending on what I’m playing. FPS, no. Single player, maybe yes. At least you have the option. \n\nI believe this person did most of the math. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/s/5I7oxYDoWn\n\nWait for reviews though before making your decision. You waited this long. Mid to end of February will be when the reviews for the 4070 come out. If you’re impatient, grab the 4070ti super. Either one will be a Nice upgrade.",
      "Also you get frame gen, something the community is split from what I’ve seen, like some ppl like it and some don’t. I personally do like it at times. Spend a bit for the 4070ti super",
      "With 12GB VRAM, you will get in same situation as with 8GB 3070.   \nI would go for 4070TI Super, 16GB Radeon cards, or wait another 12-18 months for Super series.   \nThere are rumours that 3GB VRAM modules are going to be available soon, so there is potential for 50% VRAM increase for Super models.",
      "True! My main reason to upgrade is to try games like cyberpunk with RT overdrive or Indiana Jones without the need of aggressive DLSS and prayers to reach 60 fps 😅\n\nOne could say it's more of a luxury than a need",
      "4070ti super, handles my games at 1440p, def worth that price. Handles my games and I only been playing space marine 2, Helldivers 2(both games natively at 1440p and get solid 100fps) dead island 2 gets more frames, I tried cyberpunk and metro exodus and it handled those games very well.",
      "VRAM isn't everything, that GPU is barely faster than a 4070Ti super while using way more power, it's on average 4% faster when not using any DLSS or frame gen, not worth it if you can get a 4070Ti Super",
      "I would wait a few months and see what both Nvidia and AMD have been really cooking. A 3070 is still a good card, you can hold for a few more weeks.",
      "I just upgrade from 3070 TI to 4080S world of difference, 0 regrets.",
      "I have have a 3070, the 8GB VRAM just isn't enough anymore. I'll be picking up a 5080 when they release, but the 5070ti would probably be more than enough",
      "given how FG is going to get an update for 40s series too, it might be worth reconsidering.",
      "I think maybe 5070 ti? You mentioned cyberpunk and indiana jones, those games eat a lot if vram and the ti version would be a lot more future proof. I think gpus with 12gb of vram might face problems in near future, and if i remember correctly cyberpunk almost maxed uses almost all of 12gb. So if its possible maybe wait a bit longer and save up more money for 5070 ti?",
      "I think my main concern between de 5070 and 4070ti Super is those 4gb VRAM difference. \n\nAs someone who currently owns a 8gb card playing at 1440p it's not that bad if you're not obsessed with the highest settings. In my case I only had problems with specific games that won't let me crank up some settings because of VRAM warnings or even crashed if I dare to try (Spiderman Remastered with RT and RE4)\nFor me it's not THAT big of a deal but sometimes I do feel like I'm missing out. If the 3070 had 10gb instead then probably I wouldn't be here mentioning this, and my worry is that if I decide to go for the 5070 then maybe 2 years from now I may or may not encounter the same issue. I don't know for sure if the extra L2 cache, new DLSS model or the neural rendering would be helping in that regard.",
      "OP will probably have to upgrade PSU as well then",
      "Smooth, less Power draw, more silent, most of the cases double the FPS or more.",
      "yep, depends on the game. Frame Gen can be great. in some it adds (too much) latency and isn't an option. the 50s series going to be interesting in this regard...",
      "Very often I find myself watching an optimization video and comparison of the graphics qualities for that reason.\n\nIf the difference between settings is very subtle then I usually turn them down for the sake of frames as I'm not pixel peeping all the time, but there are scenarios that make the image so much richer in detail (like the RT in Dying Light 2). \nAnd some games manage to look worse and run worse like Elden Ring's RT. That one really made my eyes bleed 😭"

A 750W gold modular PSU is $75. 512GB of M.2 SSD is $50. This is a very nice build, and almost all the parts are bargains. It's just GPUs that are off in crazytown. Don't buy \"chip shortage\" explanations of GPU pricing; we had unbuyable GPUs in 1080 Ti era with no chip shortage to speak of.\n\nI estimate that GA104 is among the most profitable products Samsung makes today on a per-wafer basis. Navi22 isn't anywhere close to the most profitable product TSMC makes, not even on 7nm, but that isn't really the problem with AMD supply. AMD's supply problem fundamentally sources from contracts they signed with the console makers, They almost certainly regret giving them priority access to parts at set ASPs.\n\nNext gen's MSRPs will go up. MSRPs have been doing that for a while now in GPU land, because it turns out the market likes more performance more than they dislike more price. Since 970, the midrange price has gone $329 -> $379 -> $499 -> $499 in theory but really $599. $699 4070 would not be weird.

The upgrade was massive, it's a fast card, but it was also a disappointment in a few cases (can't do steady >60fps in Cyberpunk 1440p PT DLSS Q), I already regret paying the 1k Euros (difference to USD is about +5%) for it (I pulled the trigger because I was scared of tariffs) The cheapest cards now start at 870, a little over a month later, while the Strix is 1200. The TUF is 950. Actually crazy.\n\nAll the 5070Ti's perform the same and a Strix card is absolutely not worth 300 extra just to get 10 degrees lower temp, (not even that much vs. the TUF, only against a 2 slot cooler) and RGB. Get a cheaper version and replace the cooling paste with PTM7950 (if you know how) and the temps will be closer to a triple slot version. Or get a 5080 for that price.",

      "You say that as though a higher resolution puts more demand on the CPU, which it doesn't. The refresh rate of your monitor is also irrelevant, because depending on the game, the GPU may or may not be able to push that. At lower resolutions tho, the CPU is more important, as the GPU can push higher framerates, so if the CPU can't keep up, it's going to bottleneck, whereas at higher resolutions the GPU is more limited, so the CPU doesn't have to be able to run such a high framerate. \n\nA 3700X is fine with a 3060Ti or 3070 or even 3080 at 1080p, and 1440p, and 4k (tho the 3060Ti and 3070 will struggle with 4k, but the CPU won't have any issue). 1440p and 4k are actually easier on the CPU lol",

Of course this really depends on usage patterns.\n\nEdit: to whomever asked if I had a source for this, not quite because most outlets haven't been doing multitasking benchmarks lately. Gamers nexus had it back when comparing Zen 2 vs Intel 10th and 11th for game streaming, but there's really not much comparing Zen 2 vs Zen 3 (3000 vs 5000). But it shouldn't be too difficult to grasp how the 2 extra cores (and 4 extra threads) will have a positive impact on multitasking. This is why I think that overall, the 250 bucks a 3700x costs is still a better deal than the 300 bucks of a 5600x.

That's why a 6 core 5600X still delivers a better experience than an 8 core 3700X.\n\nYou know you're CPU or memory bottlenecked when your GPU isn't at 95%+ usage and you haven't reached your fps limit yet. Often my 5800X only shows 20-40% in that moment, but it's my CPU and/or memory speed being the issue while my GPU usage can be anywhere from 40-70% depending on the game.\n\nMost AAA games are fully GPU bottlenecked though, at least till you start lowering settings.

      "The 3070 launched in October 2020, so yeah coming up on 4 years ago. The only new generation since then has been 40 series which came out in 2022. The 4070 from that stack actually launched later than the 80/90 launching in April 2023 so it's only just over a year old at this point. So even though your PC is coming up on 4 years old, it's still really modern.  \n\nCheckout the techpowerup page for the 3070 [here](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-3070.c3674). Scroll down to the relative performance section and you can get a quick estimate to how it stacks up to other cards. The 4060 is only 79% of a 3070, so that would be a downgrade. The 4070, is only about 20% better than a 3070, so not a huge uplift either. If you didn't have a GPU, neither are bad options, but given that you already have the 3070 both seem like bad value. You mentioned in another thread that yours is an OC model or upgraded model, and while sure it might be a few mhz higher than a stock card, those for the most part are marketing gimmicks and can mostly be ignored. A 3070 will perform within 1-3% of any other 3070 on the market. An Overclocked (OC) 3070 is still a 3070, so you won't see any huge gains over the stock performance.  \n\n\n50 series is rumored to debut in the final quarter of this year. It will most likely just be the top tier skus like the 80/90 but the 70 will follow eventually. When that generation drops, it might be worth evaluating again if you want to upgrade.",

But I specifically chose the 3070 due to it fitting in my budget, it’s p/p for what I paid, and I don’t need a 40 series card for the games I play. Chances are if I’m playing any competitive games, I’m using competitive settings anyway so it really doesn’t matter to me.",

But today I decided to browse some used gpus and found that the 3070 is pretty affordable now and I can get one for like 200€ and then maybe upgrade to am4 or keep what i have now and upgrade later on to am5.\n\nWill I see any noticeable difference on my current system if I get the 3070 or should i stick to my original plan?",

      "The thing is a 3070 isn’t great value for money, and you will see almost zero performance gain, so you’ll have nothing in return. \n\nYou should definitely just upgrade your CPU first - I went from a i5 9400+2060 up to a 3080 and it literally did not improve my fps at all until I did the CPU. If you wait like 6 months on the GPU, the 5000 series Nvidia cards will drop and that *should* also have tack-on effects that lower the prices of these cards across the board, so maybe you could afford a 3080, 4070 or 7900GRE at that point. \n\nI wouldn’t actually recommend you go all the way for a 7800X3D given what you’ve been using and happy with though; you could just get a 7600X or 9600X cheaper and enter the AM5 platform, then go for a X3D in a few generations when you’re ready to upgrade again. The only real purpose to a 7800X3D is to pair with a monstrous GPU for an enthusiast build or push high refresh rates in esports titles with a 240+ fps monitor. It doesn’t really make sense to have a 7800X3D paired with a 3070. But don’t cheap out on your RAM, get at least DDR5 6000.",
      ">3070 would bottleneck that i7\n\nNo... the reverse. Reading on, you got it right, but bottlenecks describe the weakest components throttling the rest of the system, not the stronger ones being throttled.",
      "The 3070 would be a massive waste of money at this point, upgrade your CPU to something that’ll last you. The 7700K bottlenecks your current GPU in some games, let alone a 3070.",
      "It's a fair bit faster. Regular 7000 range equal or beat the 5800x3D in most games. \n\n7800x3D is significantly faster than them.\n\nAlso 9000 range and 10000 will all fit on the same motherboard as 7000.\n\nWhereas a 5800x3D uses a motherboard that won't take any newer CPU's",

      "The right upgrade from the 2060 is the 4070 - twice the VRAM, twice as fast. That's why your original plan makes more sense. \n\nAt the same time, AM4 may be a good option too, if you get an X3D CPU and reuse the RAM. You don't really need 32GB at this point.",

Trying to build something on 300 bucks will get you nowhere, especially in non USA areas as prices are insane overseas for even outdated stuff.

      "Listen both your cpu and gpu could use an upgrade. \n\nYou can go for short term gratification and get a new gpu first, but what I would do personally is get a solid nice cpu, with mobo and ram, then slap a new gpu in later. (ASAP ideally)\n\nNot having to be cpu bottlenecked out the ass when you slap in your nice new expensive graphics card is a blessed feeling and I promise something like a 7800x3d or honestly even just a middle of the road new cpu will smoke your current i7",

When it comes down to it, I do remember a time when I could get midrange cards for about $150-200.

      "4k 120hz with ease depends on the game and settings enabled. Ray tracing has made getting a consistent 120fps much more challenging. According to Optimum Tech, Cyberpunk 2077 with an RTX 3090 running 4K, High, DLSS Performance, RT reflections + shadows, is settling around 70fps. If we bump the resolution down to 1440p we can get a 3080 closer to 100fps and a 3090 to 120fps. It all depends on how fast and how big you want to go. There's nothing wrong with playing a single-player RPG at 60fps (especially on a larger display at a higher resolution), some might even argue that it's more cinematic. And on the other hand, competitive gamers prefer to play at a lower resolution, scale, and even aspect ratio, with higher speeds because the details don't matter as much as having the lowest latency possible. 1440p 144hz on a 27-inch monitor is the sweet spot for me right now, and that's after testing a 2080ti on a 1440p 120hz 50-inch TV. Obviously, 1440p stretched across a larger display is going to look worse but not as bad as you might think. Personally, 1080p on a 27\" looks worse than 1440p on a 50\". That's probably due to viewing distance.",
      "I'd go for it. I've just picked up a 3080 here in the UK (got lucky). Life is too short to wait. If you can afford a 3080 now, you'll be able to afford a 4080 on launch date. So buy now and upgrade then if you wish.",
      "My system still kicks ass and why go through all the shit to get 1 now, I'll wait till first part of new year  When hopefully the 3080Ti comes out and drivers will be alot more mature both nvidia and amd. Plus i always wait 3-4 months after a release.",

Apart from that the software Manli provides is very basic, but of course you can use any other software you prefer instead of theirs. And that's it, very good performance for the price, good thermals, good build quality, nothing amazing but I consider it a solid option.",

Look at Forspoken as an example. Nothing about that game looks anything super special and yet it apparently maxes out at 80fps with RT off with a 4090 at 4k, far lower than a beautiful game like RDR2 gets on a 4090, along with some other better looking games.

I buy my 90 series cards as soon after release as I can, and they have been what's in stock the last few times.  But I can say I haven't been disappointed, other than my vram temperatures on my 3090, which was based on a poor design rather than anything Gigabyte themselves did.",

      "Sigh.\n\nYes the 4090 might actually be better FPS per $, but calling a $1600+ GPU a 'better value' and 'bang for buck performance' is disgusting. \n\nI hate this launch, but AMD coming up short with performance means they likely wont be much better. Duopolies suck.",
      "The 4090 is 38.7% faster in raytraced 4K, which means it's a better value at $1600 vs $1200.  Considering most people are buying these cards to play games at 4K with raytracing, you're get more bang for buck performance with the 4090, plus 24 GB VRAM.",
      "Thanks. 18-20% faster than 3090 Ti, 28% faster than 3090, and 48% faster than 3080 at. Gap grows with RT, 32% faster than 3090 at 1440p, which is DLSS Quality base resolution at 4k. \n\nPeople here are going to hate it, but the 4080 is selling out in the US for online retailers. Best Buy, Amazon, Newegg, all models at MSRP are gone. That doesn't go along with what some dumbass Techtubers say though, and the narrative that we want to believe. Even physical stores the MSRP models are gone, leaving only the heavily overpriced cards. In the coming months, I think AIB 4080 will remain at MSRP or under, and the 4090 will cast away its msrp models.\n\n7900XTX is likely to be 5-10% faster going with these results for $200 less at msrp. If the 4090 wasn't available and I absolutely had to pick one, the 4080 is a very easy choice between the two. DLSS3/DLAA, faster RT, and all the extras when it comes to software.",
      "The 4000 series really dumped all its stat points into raytracing.",
      "Its a great 4k card nevermind 1440p.",
      "How is it not bad? This is a new generation. You should be getting lower end cards that beat the high end of last gen for LESS. Otherwise what is the point? Will the 5090 be $3000?\n\nThe 1070 was equal to the 980Ti for $300 less, the 2060 was equal to a 1080 for $300 less...",
      "Mate, where have been the last 5 years? Last time GPU prices made sense was Pascal",
      "So twice the cost of the last gen cards and 30 percent more performance.\n\nAND less value for money than the overpriced 4090. \n\nGreat",
      "So 4070ti will be on par with 3090ti for $899?",
      "it's pretty close to raster tbh\n\n3080 10GB probably just didn't have enough memory to cut it at 4k RT, but at 1440p RT it seems pretty close in the percentages with raster\n\nand for the 4090, I suspect the raster perf is sometimes still bottlenecked even at 4k, and the card stretches its legs more often with RT on",
      "There is too much performance gap to label it the Ti",
      "Here's a crazy stat for you. Do you wanna know how much more expensive the 3090ti was over the 2080ti? 800$. \n\nYou're literally comparing it to the largest price increase in the history of graphics cards. Ever. And I'm now comparing that with the other largest price increase, ever, in the 2080Ti compared to the 1080ti. Close to 3x in 2 gens, and now you're applauding nvidia for making 1000+ the new mid range. Fantastic.\n\nEven at 1000$ the 4080 is a hard pass.",
      "If the price goes down on the 4080 it’ll be a great 1440p card. But looking at this.. just get an ampere card or an amd card",
      ">30 percent more performance.\n\nMinor nitpick, but that's not now percentages work. You divide by the lower number, not subtract it from 100%.\n\nIf you scroll down it even says the 4080 is **48.8% faster** than the 3080 at 4k and **45.1% faster** than 3080 10GB at 1440p",
      "Just get a 3080 if you want to game at 1440p. Or wait for the upcoming 4080 12GB... I mean 4070Ti.",
      "Came from a 2080ti + waterblock. I'm ashamed to say I'm used to these prices now 😔",
      "No points in charisma, smh",
      "If you're spending over $1k, it really doesn't make much sense to go with the 4080 to be fair.\n\nI'm not so sure that Nvidia's plan to reset the high end at above $1k will work, as those willing to spend that much will want the best, not the distant 2nd.",
      "To even give further context the 2060 wasn't particularly well received for its hefty price increase (there's a pattern here somewhere) over the 1060. And still superior value compared to Ada.",
      "Here is my review. It's overpriced and not worth it for any situation."

I haven't hooked up an fps counter but it feels like FPS sits around 50-60, it's very smooth (and super pretty).\n\nTurning DLSS off (native 1440p) takes you into the low 30s and the input lag is high. DLSS really does save the day here.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nFor clarification, this is running on a 1440p 144Hz Gsync monitor, latest Cyperpunk GameReady driver.\n\nDifferences from the RTX Ultra preset:\n\n* Screen space reflections were upped from Ultra to Psycho\n* RTX lighting was upped from Ultra to Psycho\n* DLSS was changed from \"Auto\" to \"Quality\", I found this made the edges of objects a little less fuzzy.\n* Video set to real full-screen, not the default windowed boarderless.\n\nI should also point out that my CPU (7700K) has a healthy overclock. The turboboost is unlocked for all cores (normally it only boosts a single core to max clock, now it boosts all of them), and it's overclocked from 4.2Ghz to 4.6Ghz. The chip is delidded with liquid metal because Intel put really shitty TIM in the 7XXX CPUs. Ram is 16GB 3600 DDR4.\n\nI'll get some more accurate FPS benches tonight with CPU and GPU utilization. My main takeaway and point of the post is that the game runs at a very stable ~60-ish FPS at 1440p with absolutely everything cranked - it's smooth enough during action and city areas that I'm not tempted to drop any of the image quality options for extra FPS.\n\nIf you are seeing much worse performance with a 3080, I would suggest you may have driver issues, memory bandwidth problems, or some other yet unknown issue with the game.\n\n**EDIT 2**\n\nFor those of you with AMD CPUs, you might be CPU limited due to Cyberpunk not utilizing SMT (aka Hyperthreading) on AMD:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/kbp0np/cyberpunk_2077_seems_to_ignore_smt_and_mostly/gfjf1vo/\n\nYou can try patching the game for a significant performance boost.\n\n**EDIT 3** The AMD issue was officially fixed back in patch 1.05\n\n> [AMD SMT] Optimized default core/thread utilization for 4-core and 6-core AMD Ryzen(tm) processors. 8-core, 12-core and 16-core processors remain unchanged and behaving as intended. This change was implemented in cooperation with AMD and based on tests on both sides indicating that performance improvement occurs only on CPUs with 6 cores and less.\n\nSo it shouldn't do anything anymore.",

      "I think everyones getting a bit caught up in the difference between the Vram on the 90 and the 80. Looking at those specs, there really arent a lot of things that gamers will do to max out the 10GB (potentially in certain circumstances but i would imagine few and far between) Nvidia really cant launch the 3080 with 20GB (10 or 20 is only option at 320 bus i believe) as its just gonna be way too close to the 3090. Looking at the size of the 3090 it seems to me like Nvidia know the performance difference between these two cards isnt actually going to be that great so they shoved the VRAM up massively, stuck a massive cooler on it and threw a load more electricity through it in the hope to justify the price tag. I think the 3080 may surprise people here and will be the better buy, even if i dont agree with the prices of any of them. If it turns out the 10GB isnt enough can probably sell in 2-3 months for a 20GB AIB and lose £50-£100",

The price is estimated to be US$999 against AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT. The GPU specifications are very close to the GeForce RTX 3090, but the memory is frequent. The bandwidth will be reduced from 384bit to 320bit, and the memory capacity will be reduced from 24GB to 20GB GDDR6X. NVIDIA is waiting to see that AMD’s new card cannot be ignored.\n\n \n\nAccording to the information obtained, NVIDIA is planning to launch the \"GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\", which will be positioned between RTX 3090 and RTX 3080. It will use GA102-250-KD-A1 graphics core, PG133-SKU15 PCB design, and built-in The same 10496 CUDA Cores as RTX 3090, but the memory configuration is reduced to 20GB GDDR6X VRAM, 320-bit memory interface. RTX 3080 Ti will have the same TGP as RTX 3080, which is controlled at the level of 320W, and also does not support NVLink.\n\n \n\nIn terms of price, the Taiwan board manufacturer stated that the RTX 3080 Ti is estimated to be priced at USD 999. It has to be said that the price-performance ratio of the \"GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\" is much more attractive than that of the GeForce RTX 3090 at the asking price of US$1,499, which makes AMD Radeon more attractive. The price and memory capacity advantages of the RX 6900 XT have completely disappeared.",

    "selftext": "I managed to grab a 5080 FE on Best Buy on Thursday to replace my 3080 FE and had it delivered today. I just play single player stuff, nothing competitive, prefer playing with a controller, and I have a 3440x1440 165Hz screen. I just want my games to play smooth and look pretty.\n\nI won't wade into the \"fake frames\" argument too much, but from my eye, MFG looks as good as native and I can't detect the added input latency, so I'm pretty pleased with it! Cyberpunk at max/psycho settings chugged on my 3080 (maybe 15-20fps?) and with 3x MFG on the 5080, it's about 150fps. It feels great, looks gorgeous, and is on another planet compared to the 3080.\n\nI think 4080 owners who already have 2x FG aren't missing much skipping this gen (I always try to skip a gen, so seems wise to do regardless), but anyone with a 3080 or earlier, this is an awesome upgrade, especially in titles that support all the AI tech.\n\nOnly downside I'm seeing is the VRAM. Star Wars Outlaws (again at max settings) happily filled up 14Gb, so that 16Gb probably isn't gonna keep things particularly future proofed (much like the 10Gb on the 3080 didn't). They really, *really* should have launched the 5080 with 20-24Gb.\n\nI'm excited to try out some PCVR on my Quest 3 tomorrow. The 3080 had some trouble with the higher res panels on the Quest 3 (compared to the Valve Index which it did pretty OK with), so I'm excited to try it out.\n\nedit:\n\nHad a few requests for some VR impressions. I didn't spend too much time with it today, but that was because it kept hitching every \\~10-15 seconds. I was getting fantastic, 120fps performance, but every 10-15 seconds (I wasn't timing it) it'd hang. Obviously a no-go with VR. I don't know where the issue is, if it's the 5080 or something else, but I didn't feel like troubleshooting. My experience with wireless VR has been less than stellar - it seems like it never works quite right despite having a dedicated AP and all the \"best\" hardware. I might go back to a wired headset...",

      "I have a 3080, and the ram limitation really put a sour taste in my mouth in regards to upgrading to the 5080, I think I'll wait for the 60' series or they might release a super or Ti with higher vram.",
      "Same. There’s just too many small gotchas this gen. The ram. The cost. The availability. The limited perf difference without frame gen (which even the 30 series is benefiting from). Feels like a 5080 Ti in 2026 on maybe a process shrink is the way to go.",
      "I'm glad you posted this because I have a very similar experience. Playing on a 1440p OLED 240hz screen, and I upgraded to a 5080 FE from an EVGA 3080 FTW3. Side tangent, holy crap, FE cards are amazing. I love the design and how high quality the aluminum casing feels. Makes the EVGA card feel like a toy.\n\nAnyways, I'm running Cyberpunk at maxed settings (max/psycho, path tracing, etc) with MFG 4x and it looks pretty damn good-getting 210 average FPS. Without MFG, I'm getting around 75, so the base fps is high enough to where the input latency doesn't seem to feel off. I can't say if the image quality is exactly like native, I haven't look at side-by-side comparisons, but I have zero complaints about it. No really obvious smearing or visual glitches like I noticed with DLSS 3, which is mostly fixed with DLSS 4. This tech legit feels like magic. I can't wait for Reflex 2.\n\nYes, NVIDIA tried to get away with some marketing BS around MFG but I really wouldn't write the whole tech off because of that, guys. I think you'll be blown away if you're able to run it properly. MFG should be the cherry on top of your sundae, not a band-aid to fix poor performance.",
      "They will never process shrink for a super or ti version. They would have to redesign the entire pcb.",
      "Yeah I might sell this one and grab the inevitable 5080 Ti to get a proper amount of VRAM, then skip the 60 series. But, I'm going to have no trouble enjoying this one for the foreseeable future.",
      "Seems like you have a 4080. I would just wait one more year for 6000 series at that point. 5080 Ti(S) will just have 20-24 Gb of RAM and maybe a 20% performance uplift to be on par with a 4090. \n\n6000 series will be on 3nm node + new architecture so you´ll get a REAL bump in performance & efficiency and again some new AI futures probably.",
      "Yep totally agree. It seems like everyone's writing off MFG like it \"doesn't count\" but, like, it really works. Better than I expected. So I'm more than happy to press that \"more FPS please\" button in any game that has it 😂",
      "Yeah ill wait for a 24GB 5080",
      "VRAM allocated does not mean all of it is actually required",
      "Let us know how VR fairs with the 5080. I was looking for a 5090 but can only get a hold of a 5080 (from a 3070ti at 1440p, and Quest 2)",
      "MFG latency is mostly a non-issue for 80-class cards since the pre-FG framerates is high enough. For 70-class and below it's a different story.\n\nI don't think VRAM would be problem in the next 3 to 4 years since most game developers optimize for Nvidia cards when making PC games and they know the vast majority of high-end PC doesn't have more than 16GB of VRAM. Any decent developers would make sure their game run well at 4K on 16GB VRAM.",
      "Cyberpunk was massively updated graphically in 2023 and is, afaik, to this day the only open world game out there that does full path tracing. It is about as demanding as they come.",
      "Same boat.  I capped my 3080's 10GB on the very first game I played (Cyberpunk) because I game in 4K.  No mods or anything.  And if OP found a game that eats 14GB at 1440p then it's an easy guess it would saturate 16GB at 4K without much more effort.\n\nWhat really makes this easy is that there's not some blatant _\"here comes the big-ass release where an upgrade is very much advised\"_ game on the immediate or even medium-term horizon. \n My next game is _Yakuza Pirate_ and it'll probably run just as silky smooth as _Infinite Wealth_ did before it.  This isn't like when the 30xx series dropped and _Cyberpunk 2077,_ the literal GPU-sweating replacement for _Crysis,_ was fresh on the shelves.",
      ">5080 Ti(S) will just have 20-24 Gb of RAM and maybe a 20% performance uplift to be on par with a 4090.\n\nI don't understand why people think there will be 5080 Ti lmao\n\nWhat for? Who are they competing against?\n\nThey can release a 5080 super with 24GB and exactly the same performance by using 3GB GDDR7 memory chips. That's about all you can expect a year from now, guys. 5% more performance because the clocks will boost a little higher, same GPU.",
      "I'm on the 3080 and the ti is what i'm waiting for. 16gb just doesn't seem enough of an upgrade to get me through the next four/five years.",
      "They can potentially go to 24GB using Samsung’s new 24Gbit GDDR7 modules but they only sampled in late 2024. The only other way is make a wider memory bus but that’d require a bigger die and that won’t happen (unless they have 5090 rejects they want to make a Ti from).\n\nThe other thing in the pipeline from the Blackwell whitepaper are neural textures, DLSS for textures.",
      "I think the \"fake frame\" discussion will age poorly. It's just new. What is a \"real\" frame? Who decided this? What does it matter which algorithm generated it? \n\nFor competitive gamers where each frame is extremely important and you need every frame to be an input frame, I get it, you won't like this stuff. But us mere mortals... it's not \"fake frames.\" It's just the computer being a little smarter than you're used to.",
      "Check Jays2cents video, 5080 has immense OC potential and almost touches 4090 after OC \\[on air\\]",
      "Exactly. This is why I’m more Excited for the 50 series. People say fake frames but it’s giving you more then double the fps for slight latency hit if your setup is correct. I have no complaints from what I’ve seen from the videos of cyberpunk being fully cranked up hitting over 200+fps. \n\nFunny how that works you don’t hear people saying “fake resolution with dlss” people pick and choose \n\nBoth imo are insane and it opens doors on what these cards can actually do",

If Nvidia wanted to help gamers then all these chips would instead be turned into 3080's to increase the suppy of those.",

There is not a large enough gap in performance between the 3080 and the 3090 to add another card that splits the difference in a meaningful way.",

      "As Steve mentioned, if Nvidia could have forseen the market conditions that would follow, they would have priced the 3080 higher than the $700 MSRP.  \n\nIt's already pretty evident that Nvidia initially intended the 3080 Ti to be $999, but decided to cash in on the market situation and price it at $1200 instead.",

Making it easier to supply by a lot because Micron the supplier of the ram is also scrounging for silicon.\n\nShould they have just focused on the 3080 or maybe even the 3070 instead,  yeah probably but,  it's basically an excuse for it to exist.",

Even buying a bundle full of stuff you don't need supports bad behavior from the online retailers.\n\nBe patient folks and the prices will come down eventually.  The 5090 stock was purposely low to see how far they could push up the MSRP.  It is basically an IQ test and many failed it.\n\nI could totally afford to buy a GPU for 4 grand.  But after building PC's for over 20 years, I know how ridiculous it is for one component to cost this much and refuse to support this behavior.  If people weren't buying them, the price would have already dropped.",

Your Indiana jones example falls apart when you flip 2 settings for zero perceivable fidelity impact with a great performance uplift.

    "selftext": "I worked at Apple for about 4 years between 2012-2016, and they gradually had a worsening scalper problem with new iPhone launches from iPhone 4 to iPhone 6S. The solution that they came up with was simple:\n\nRegardless of whether the phones were in stock at the time, everyone who places an order gets a confirmation email and an ETA of their shipping time. Obviously the later you order the further down the queue you are and longer the ETA.\n\nFor example, if Nvidia had 10000 units of the RTX 3080 then the first 10000 orders would get a shipping ETA of 1-3 business days. Those who are the next batch would get an ETA of 1-2 weeks, then 3-4 weeks and so on (based on production volumes). \n\nThis way staying up to wait for the launch will actually feel like a positive experience because at least you know you got the order in, and can get an estimate of when it will ship. Nvidia will also get money upfront (or at least credit card details if they want to be nice to the customers and not charge until shipping), and it will be harder for scalpers to sell to people who know they have cards on the way for MSRP. It’s a win-win situation. Nvidia can also take their time and manually review bulk scalper purchases while people wait patiently.\n\nAfter Apple implemented this system for the iPhone 7 and later launches, the # of scalpers reduced drastically. Why don’t more companies do this?",

      "That would be too smart for them. Look at every card release they have done... shit show.\n\nBut yes, I’d be happy to order even if it said “you’re in the system, but your order is 3 months away”. \n\nRather than the lottery of life and just logging on at the right time.",

It allowed up to an hour to complete the pre-order.\nWorked like a charm for me and I imagine not many bots would get through. Seems a much better and fairer system to me.",

      "Because that would highlight that there is simply not enough cards produced and having a 2021 ETA for a FE 3080 would probably push A LOT of people to wait AMD answer.  \n\nAlso they know that if they say to customer “you can get a 3080 the 15th november” a lot of them would settle then for a 3070, which is cheaper and probably more appropriate for their needs.  \n\nThe issue is not inherent to Nvidia, everyone in the semiconductor space is affected, only Nvidia doesn’t want to acknowledge it:  \n- PS5 back ordered to hell (ETA Q2 2021 if you preorder today).  \n- Valve index 8 to 12 weeks until delivery since March.  \n- Xbox series X, supply rumored to be twice as low as the PS5 at launch.  \n- Apple iPhones announcement delayed.  \n- AMD said to investors “next gen consoles will not be the first Rdna 2 chips on the market”, announcement of Radeon 6XXX is 15 days before the console launch.",

They will post overall revenue, and maybe revenue by market (like Gaming, AI, etc. - which their alleged lying about just recently brought them some alleged trouble) - but they never, ever give raw numbers. \n\nThey absolutely do not want anyone knowing that they're only producing a thousand cards a week or whatever ridiculously low number it is. For multiple reasons. But a huge one is competition. They absolutely do not want AMD knowing they're having trouble producing cards. That would be terrible. \n\nThen you have AIBs. Well, no AIB except EVGA that I know of sells cards themselves. They all go through etailers and B&M retailers. That means 1) the AIB partners can't do a queue since they're not directly selling, and 2) the etailers like Newegg can't do a queue since they have no way of knowing how many stock they'll get in and when. \n\nThey could do a \"you're #8548 in line,\" but that would be REALLY disheartening without any sort of timeline, and you know damn well it would make everyone MUCH more angry.",

This alone requires a team of engineers and millions of dollars of investment a year, and external audits. A queueing system is complicated, and is still vulnerable to bots as well.\n\nPeople significantly underestimate the amount of work it is to stop bots. CAPTCHAS do not stop them, they only stop the most rudimentary bots, and are a non-problem for more advanced ones. This is why more retailers don't even bother using them as they make the experience shit for real customers, while doing nothing to stop bots.\n\nThere's a handful of companies specializing in these high volume \"flash sales\", such as sneakers, concert tickets, etc. Nvidia could partner with one of them if they cared enough to help deal with this problem, but chances are they don't and this is just PR to soothe the pain. At the end of the day, selling to scalpers gives them their money, drives demand up, and lets them increase prices.\n\nSource: I work for one of those giant ecommerce companies, we deal a lot with bots and it's a hard problem."

    "title": "A Guide On How To Buy A RTX 3080 - USA Edition",
    "selftext": "It's been 3 months since the launch of the RTX 3080 and it ***STILL*** seems impossible secure (and don’t get me started about the scalpers). I spent a lot of time trying to get a RTX 3080 to complete my build, and I honestly thought about giving up.\n\nAfter all my trial and error, I want to say it is **NOT** impossible. It has been starting to get a bit easier, but regardless of what people say, there are things you can do to increase your chances of success.\n\n# Requirements:\n\n* Computer\n* iOS Device (Not needed, but helps)\n* Understand the checkout quirks of each retailer (explained later)\n\n# 1. Getting Alerts\n\nThe first part to getting an RTX graphics card is knowing when retailers restock. There are many servers / twitters that will send a notification when specific items come into stock. I'd recommend following them on Twitter and turning on notifications. Most of them who have been tracking NVIDIA RTX cards, have now started to track other hard to find tech items such as ZEN 3 and RX 6000 Big Navi cards.\n\nStockDrops — [https://twitter.com/BotRtx](https://twitter.com/BotRtx)   \nSnail Monitor — [https://twitter.com/SnailMonitor](https://twitter.com/SnailMonitor)  \nGPU In-Stock Bot Alerts — [https://twitter.com/liquidfreeno](https://twitter.com/liquidfreeno)  \nTechStockBot— [https://twitter.com/\\_rtxbot\\_](https://twitter.com/_rtxbot_)  \nFatKidAlerts — [https://twitter.com/FatKidAlerts](https://twitter.com/FatKidAlerts) (Not all tweets are RTX restocks but a lot are)  \nNewegg — [https://twitter.com/Newegg](https://twitter.com/Newegg) (Often tweets what time restocks happen)  \nBroBot — [https://t.me/RTX3080Alerts](https://t.me/RTX3080Alerts)  \n[https://www.hotstock.io/](https://www.hotstock.io/) (highly recommended)  \n[https://www.nowinstock.net/](https://www.nowinstock.net/)  \n[https://www.twitch.tv/falcodrin](https://www.twitch.tv/falcodrin) (livestream, alerts with audio)\n\n# 2. Setting Up Settings\n\nBy default on a mobile device, apps will open links in the in app browser. Within the app settings change it to have links open in **Safari / disable in-app browser**. This will automatically open the Newegg / Amazon / Best Buy app when you click on a product link.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1cpwywu3nx661.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=01d3b074702a3040bceef13e3dfaf27273c472de\n\n# 3. Setting Up Apple Pay Settings (If you have an iOS device)\n\nDownload the Newegg app, click on a random item, click the **Apple Pay button** on the bottom left and it should ask you to input your Shipping Information and Billing Information. Ensure you have those set up.\n\n[Setting Up Apple Pay](https://preview.redd.it/p36gg3pvlx661.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=700180cfbfdc34efc42a626be195e023b2620b17)\n\n# 4. Checkout Methods For Each Retailer\n\nAfter trying my best to get a RTX 3080 on all retailers, I am going to discuss some tips on how to checkout with every retailer. Everything mentioned will apply to RTX cards, Big Navi and ZEN 3 as well. It’s not easy but it’s possible. You have to ensure you are either on your phone or computer when restocks happen immediately. A few seconds matters a lot (see the restock schedule later in the doc)\n\n## Newegg\n\nNewegg has been the easiest in my opinion, as they started to announce when they restock on Twitter. There are many different tips and tricks you can try on Newegg.\n\n**Q: What is the the checkout method? (May not always work, explained later)**\n\n1. Add all products you want to a wishlist\n2. 30 seconds before a drop, start swiping down on the wishlist page (to refresh).\n3. When the **ADD ALL TO CART** button turns yellow, hit it quickly and attempt to checkout.\n\n**Q: Should I use Newegg.com or the Newegg mobile app?**\n\nThere have been many conflicting opinions with Apple Pay vs Computer on Newegg. I have seen the app fail many times, including the wishlist not refreshing anymore, so I would not recommend it every time.\n\nFrom what I see, when Newegg ***announces a restock,*** I’d recommend to use the computer / Newegg.com to checkout. The app seems to fail when too many users are using the app.\n\n**Q: How do I setup my Newegg.com account?**\n\nGo to Newegg.com, add an item to cart, and go through the checkout process. When adding your address, I recommend clicking the dropdown.\n\nIf your account is configured correctly, it should only ask for your CVV **every time** you checkout.\n\n**Q: What if they do not announce restock?**\n\nIf they do not announce restock and you get an alert for restock, I would recommend using **Apple Pay** and **Newegg app.** When alerts pop up, click the link to the product, and you will usually see the Apple Pay button on the bottom. Click on that IMMEDIATELY, and it will tell you to use face id or fingerprint. After authenticating, it will checkout immediately.\n\n## Best Buy\n\nEnsure you have an account setup on Best Buy with default shipping/billing/credit card setup. When Best Buy restocks, click the link and find the product YOU WANT. Best Buy only allows you to get one card at once.\n\nWith the new queue system, attempt to add to cart, but *ensure you stay on the screen*. You cannot navigate away.\n\n[Please Wait](https://preview.redd.it/ttxqlxhxlx661.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=e32cf0fad7f229c57ada2962f26c441f50dff03a)\n\nEventually, the **Add To Cart** button will appear and you can add the item the cart. Checkout as fast as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Add To Cart Button](https://preview.redd.it/98jh2rcylx661.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cfc12230ca09763883a3e424647c132f7b91838)\n\nMy recommendation would be to use an account on your computer, and a different account on your mobile device, because the queue system is random. It does not have a priority as to when you can add to cart. When it restocks, add the product on your computer, and another different one on your phone.\n\nWhichever one comes first, attempt to checkout.\n\n## Amazon\n\nAmazon will restock a lot of products everyday, but likes to restock a very tiny amount each time, often less than 10 stock of each product at once.\n\nThe best way to get something off Amazon is to ensure you have your [1-Click Settings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201889370) configured. This will minimize clicking involved when you are on the checkout screen.\n\nWhen a product is alerted for restock, I recommend **spamming** the Add To Cart button for a few minutes, as stock will sometimes will come in staggered. If the product adds to cart, immediately checkout as fast as possible.\n\n[Amazon Add To Cart](https://preview.redd.it/ht71fxzzlx661.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=01fb18c483476da139c649876ffe4f4f399dbecc)\n\nI found using the computer to be the best, but the mobile app can work as well.\n\n## BHPhotovideo\n\nNot many bots are after BHPhotovideo, so you have a good chance of getting on here if they restock. Just note, BHPhotovideo rarely restocks.\n\nFor the checkout process, just like other retailers, ensure you have an account setup ahead of time. I’ve had good luck with Paypal, but both normal checkout or Paypal should work.\n\n## Other Retailers\n\nOf course there are other retailers such as ASUS, ZOTAC, Antonline, etc that release stock. The process is usually the same, ensure an account is setup beforehand, use autofill if possible, and pray you can checkout when it comes into stock!\n\n# 5. When Do Retailers Restock?\n\nAfter a month of logging when retailers restock, I have found a few patterns between some retailers. To increase your chances of success, make sure to be ready during these time windows (esp for Newegg):\n\n* Newegg: Mon— Fri, most often on or near the dot. Either 4 PM, 5PM or 6 PM PST. I recommend following Newegg on Twitter as they seem to have tweeting out restock times. If there is no tweet, expect for restock around 4 - 6 PM PST.\n* Best Buy: Generally drops every other week, usually Tues — Fri, mostly in the morning, before 12 PM PST.\n* Amazon: Random, will drop on weekdays/weekends at anytime.\n* BHPhotovideo: Random, mostly weekdays, but weekend drops can happen.\n\nThanks for reading the guide! I wish you all the best on securing an NVIDIA RTX graphics card!",

      "I used the Twitch streamer Falcodrin to get my 3080.  They had alerts for basically every retailer that would re-stock and they knew ahead of time generally when stock was about to drop due to changes on websites or something, so you could prepare.  Of course you still have to fight everyone else trying to get one of the cards but at least you know when it's coming.",
      "It sure is.",
      "Gains is gains.",
      "You joke, but instead of waiting 6 months for stock normalize, you now wait 3 months or less. Or you have a longer window to successfully check out, not to mention scalper prices will drop which would reduce scalping and increase stock as well.",
      "My method for getting both 3080 and 5900x was very similar. I would watch Falcodrin’s stock checking stream every Thursday-Friday from like 4-8. That’s typically when Newegg drops. I had Apple Pay on my phone. I would click the links in chat to add the item to cart and then checkout using Apple Pay on the app. Worked like a charm. It was almost efficient enough to consider scalping but I’m also not a piece of shit\n\nEdit: you don’t have to actively watch the stream. Just have it running with volume on (easy assuming you’re home anyway). Apparently that’s really hard for people to understand.",
      "Lmao you saying that is hilarious because it was hard as shit to get a 1080 for a while due to another mining craze. \n\nAnd it’s even more insane because compared to now it was a walk in the park. \n\nBasically if you were willing to buy one of the high end 1080s you could reliably get one. Miners wanted the cheapest cards because of RoI reasons. They’d still get more expensive ones, but they’d stay in stock for minutes or hours. Just back then no one wanted to pay nearly $800 for a 1080.\n\nToday you have people lining up in the freezing cold every day at microcenter for the “privilege” of potentially paying $850 + tax for a 3080. \n\nAnd the crazy bit? They can still flip those for 1-1.2k+ on eBay, where people with more money than brains have convinced themselves they *need* a 3080 or they can’t run 2077 on ultra max psycho and the game would be ruined then. \n\nI remember the launch threads where people were literally confessing to staying up for multiple days or having intense anxiety/depression (I’m not kidding) over not getting these cards. It’s... insane. You’re basically competing to get this card against people who have made it a borderline religious ideology to get this card. \n\nAdd to that the production shortages and... \n\nAnyway I’m also still rocking my 1080. It’s serving me well. But I do wish for more with my 1440p144hz monitor these days. As you said, no big rush. But this entire trainwreck has certainly been interesting to watch/participate in.",
      "Well it was supposed to be October. Then November. Then late December-Jan. \n\nNow March at the earliest according to Nvidia iirc. Maybe pushing into April. (At least iirc) \n\nImagine buying a card that’s nearly 3/4ths of a year old by the time you can buy it without using a bot or no-life watching alerts and dropping *everything* you’re doing when one pops up to try and get one.",
      "Dude we've already waited 3 months, how much longer?",
      "I've been trying to buy a 3080 since launch for work\n\nSigned up for all the deal alerts, signed up for EVGA's email notices, etc.  NUTHIN\n\nBut then Nvidia/their partners turn around and hand GPUs out like candy to reviewers and celebrities to promote how great they are, while also ramping up production of Ti/Super variants just to compete with AMD's new GPUs.\n\nThey should have delayed the 30 series launch into next year when they had enough stock built up.  \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the scalping bullshit.\n\nFuck 2020.",
      "I think they should have better bot protection. They boast about their Ai technologies, but can't prevent bots on their own store.",

      "Awesome work!! FTW3 disappointing again and the FE is amazing performance for the price.

It's at best 3% better than any MSRP card for $110 more. Doesn't make sense. \n\nSecondly, the guy who posted this also posted 3090 reviews which included the Strix. Unluckily TPU doesn't have a strix 3080 that they reviewed so it's not shown here. Either way, the Strix outclasses and significantly beats the FTW3 in every aspect at the same price point. I'm pretty sure as other aibs release cards at this price they'll outperform it too. The only thing giving it the advantage is the 3x8 connectors. Other than that they cheaped out on the whole PCB which shows. \n\nKeep trying to justify your purchase with \"MUH RGB AND MUH WARRANTY\" when you'll probably never speak to CS in the lifetime of the card",

      "Gaming X Trio would probably come number 1 if the price/ratio was not the driving factor. The card is having the best FPS in the most games and is one of the most quiet card. People buying a 3080 want the best gaming experience, so I would say your card is a good buy.",

      "That was slightly the point of this chart, just to see how little the differences were to make an informed decision and be able to justify going with the card you like instead of the supposed top performer"

I arrived at 11 pm and was around 19th in line. 2 people bailed around 0030 so I’m 17th. 3 am rolls around and we have about 25 deep. Alarm goes off at the location and so the cops and the microcenter manager shows up. He gives everyone his most recent update which is that this location will have 12 cards. He also updates what stock it will be which is apparently MSI ventus and ASUS Tuf. 4 more people leave so I’m lucky #13. I asked the manager, is there any point in me or the guys behind me sticking around? He was like probably not, I would go home and sleep. At this point, I’m like fuck it, I will roll the damn dice. I’m here after all. Most the line behind me takes off. An hour later, the line continues to grow regardless of the information that was bestowed upon us. 8 am rolls around and they’re passing out vouchers. The information was correct. I’m lucky #13 and no voucher. I’m crushed. The manager tells me to put my name and number down on a list and maybe there’s a slight chance they get more in that day. They’ll call me if that happens. Done deal, I’m #1 on this damn pity list. I go home annoyed with myself and the entire situation and pass the fuck out. Wake up to a call 2 hours later. Not only did they get at least one more card in for me, but it’s the EVGA Ultra. Bottom line: Never give up, never surrender.",

      "For all of you who don’t typically participate in high demand “hype” drops like this: welcome to the show. This is what it’s like - it’s literal cancer. Bots are taking over completely. Real humans have a better shot at the powerball lottery than securing a “hype” drop manually. \n\nThe people who purchased these cards are most likely completely unfamiliar and uninvolved with PC gaming or PC’s in general, and only purchased because of the resale value. Look it up, a group of botters purchased hundreds of cards just to resell. One person in specific purchased over 45 cards for himself to resell. I imagine it’s just another group of losers trying to make a quick buck without leaving their mom’s home and working an actual job. What you imagine these freaks like, is probably the way they truly are.\n\nDo not support the resellers. The only way they make their money is if we buy them. If we don’t, they’ll have to eat the thousands of dollars they spent, lower their prices, or somehow return them to NVIDIA to be relisted for retail.\n\nEverybody stay strong. I can’t stress this enough. It’s beyond important that nobody purchases from any of these resellers. If they see sales, others will follow and jack up the prices. If the resale value plummets, or sales aren’t booming, the likelihood of the restocks being botted drop tremendously. Our goal is to purchase directly from retailers at retail price. I don’t care if you find a card $200 over retail. Do. Not. Purchase. It creates a resale market for these cards, which promotes botting, backdooring, scalping, etc. If the resale market dies, the retail market will rise. It’s the only way to combat this. I want one of these beasts in my PC just as bad as the other guy, and we’ll get there - but not like this. I’ll say it again, do not purchase from resellers. Please.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the gold kind stranger",

Overall, in many games I got rid of need for DLSS Performance and got that sharpness back. Also got to use Frame Generation, it's nice to bump the framerate a bit. Generally the games that were around 40-50fps got to playable 60-70. And instead of playing with blurry low resolution 90fps I now play at full resolution 90fps. You also notice how VRAM usage for many games is more than 10gb I had before, usually around 11-12gb VRAM. I also got the VRR flicker now.\n\nEDIT: Build specs.\nRyzen 7 5800x3d   (big gaming improvement)\nRTX 5080 16gb      (the cheapest ZOTAC OC one)\nRAM DDR4 32gb @ 3660mhz\nMonitor: Samsung Odyssey G9 OLED\nPSU 850W be quiet!\nidk what else\nCouple of SSDs, a sick case, ASUS Motherboard",

Far better than what my 3080 could achieve. I played Arc Raiders over the weekend with settings all maxed on Epic and used DLAA and played with 110-130 frames and that game looks fantastic.

Note: acceptable does not mean \"it's not running at 1000fps like the 5090 does.\" Acceptable means you say \"I'm enjoying myself and my gaming experience is not being severely interrupted by the lack of performance from my rig.\"\n\nI am also running a 3080ti and despite all the crap it got in reviews, it has basically run every game I've played amazingly. It is aging very well (even the 12gb VRAM). I think it'll last at least through the 5000 series, and if the 6000 series also sucks, it could probably still hold it's own through that series.\n\nAlso remember how much money it's going to cost you!! Basically no 5080s in stock under $1400. That's A LOT of money for something you already have one of. You could keep that for the next REAL GPU upgrade Nvidia gives us.",

      "Ill be honest, I dont play anything competitive, framegen and upscaling are fuckin awesome lol \n\n\nI dont notice any input lag, and if there is some, its definitely not the reason im dying or doing poorly.\n\n\nThe problem is, some games use it as an excuse to NOT optimize. And I think thats a much MUCH MUCH bigger problem than the downsides of using framegen.\n\n\nNvidia being a not so great company nonwithstanding. Im not a fan of them by any means. Ive used both FSR3 and DLSS, no complaints. \n\n\nSome DLSS settings actually look visually better than without, which is the DLAA workin im guessing.\n\n\nIts no excuse to fuck the hardware up, but the tech itself isnt satan. lol"

(*also stores here have less stock than the average USA shop*). So I can't \"just buy a FE card\"...\n\nCurrently, I'm looking at two cards that would work for my setup and are available:\n\nMSI GeForce RTX3080 Ti Gaming X Trio 12G (1500 EUR)\n\nor\n\nMSI GeForce RTX3090 SUPRIM X 24G. (2000 EUR)\n\nBoth are expensive, and I could wait a bit, but ultimately, I'm more interested in whether the extra price of the 3090 (and its double amount of memory) are \"*worth*\". \n\nNow I understand \"worth\" is relative and can vary from person to person, but overall, the concept is quite applicable; I can afford both, but I don't like to spend 35% more money for 1 extra FPS.\n\nThey are primarily going to be used with a 1440p/144hz display, and will run MSFS2020, XPlane, DCS, and any other game I throw at it; ideally, the less I need to lower from Ultra the merrier.\n\nI have been outside of the PC \"market\" for almost 3 years so I don't know what's \"new\" or if it would be better to wait a bit. I'm not in a super rush but the 2080 is having a hard-ish time keeping up with MSFS. The CPU is a Ryzen 7 3800X that I'm not planning on upgrading for now. The rest are Gen3 NVMes and 850W power supply (Corsair HX850i) on an Aorus Master X570.\n\nThanks for any advice!",

All the people that bought the 3060 are increasing the difficulty of everything else extremely quickly because Ethereum is like 95% of the mining market, so if altcoins get flooded with difficulty they'll make like 1/4th of what they are now when Ethereum ends. The only time other coins make more than Ethereum is when they briefly surge in price so it's pure speculation to mine other coins over Ethereum.\n\nThere could still be a situation where a 3080 Ti is priced similarly on Ebay to a 3080 if both are going for around $2k. Miners could keep the 3080 bid up.\n\nEdit: Hell, the 3080 could at times be selling for more than a 3080 Ti on ebay.",

      "I really hope the 3080 Ti release before CP 2077. It's so damn close.",
      "That's what I've been saying. They aren't channeled, they're just passive heatsinks which begs the question why wouldn't that have been better served as a traditional design?\n\nFurther, I still don't get why one fan seems to be running in pull config when fans are at least somewhat more effective in push? Some of the depth of the fins won't even have air going through them as air will go through the path of least resistance.\n\nI'm no engineer so I'll wait for benchmarks, but I don't see why so many people seem so excited about the \"innovative design\" shown. It's just different, that doesn't necessarily mean better.\n\n[Edited for accuracy]",
      "Previous leak made me think that visible black lines were made out of plastic and were just covering heatsinks. Now I can only say that this is going to be very expensive to make, such a complex design with black coloring even on heatpipes.",
      "Yea I dont care what it says.  If that costs $150 to produce at scale, then Nvidia is doing something desperately wrong here.\n\nThere's just no way.",
      "I very much doubt they would cost $150 when produced in volume, I find it more likely that such a price figure originated from these pre-production samples rather than as a prospective figure for a mass production run.",
      "No way.  Even if the 3000 series gpus are released before mid September the only one available will likely be FE versions and they will probably be sold out anyway.",
      "The fans to me look to both be in a push configuration. The rear fan seems to be in the traditional orientation with the other fan pushing air down from the CPU area to beneath the GPU.  \n\n\nBut yeah, I'm not really expecting much from this design. It looks like it would be somewhere between a blower design and your typical open air cooler from a cooling performance standpoint.",
      "Or its just an excuse to raise the price of the FE cards even higher.",
      "what does the Chinese text on the box above say?",
      "The first real RTX 2000 leak (a PCB) happened just 1 month before the cards were in the shops. Nvidia doesn't like to wait for competition, they love being the first one, so it makes sense for them to release their GPUs before the big console announcements during the summer and before RDNA2. These photos seem to be taken at a factory that is starting the mass production of the GPUs, I doubt Nvidia is going to start mass production now just to store the GPUs for 4 months in a warehouse.  I think that RTX 3000 GPUs will be launched during July.",
      "ffs people see two blurry photos leak and now they know everything about how well the design will work and how much it will affect the cost of the card.",
      "Blowing hot air into the case is often the way to go for high-end cards because you can increase the airflow of the case easily, but the airflow of the GPU not so much. Blower-style coolers are limited by how hard they can push air through the back of the case. Here's an example illustrating the two: [https://media.dragonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/23035543/3573246899fb475e450fbe40759bbaf7.png](https://media.dragonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/23035543/3573246899fb475e450fbe40759bbaf7.png)",

      "But that makes no sense.  It's not Nvidia telling us the cost of the cooler, and how would that be any sort of justification anyways?  \n\nLike, I've heard many people say this, but it doesn't make any sense if you actually stop and think about it for a second.

      "My RTX 3080 Ti had very high VRAM temperature - Tj almost always 110°C no matter what i tired. So i finally opened it up to find missing thermal pad on four VRAM chips.",
      "Jezus how can this happen on such a high-end card",
      "There are some markings on heat spreader like pad was here for a few seconds, but the VRAM chips are clean. So I assume thermal pad somehow fall before putting heat spreader on PCB.",
      "It's fine after re-padding - max 80°C on VRAM.",
      "And what now…they say it’s your fault cause you opened it?  This is bullshit for consumer protection",
      "What bothers me about all of this is that it seems to affect everyone (no consistency other than the fact anyone could be affected) and the only way I have to confirm whether my pads are present with full coverage is to risk opening the card. I mean sure, my temps are fine, but even there I have heard that replacing good working pads can be a 10C drop on memory temp.",
      "Tough luck man damn",
      "I've added missing pad and changed existing ones - just to be safe. I have also added additional pad as recommended for 3080 TUF (non Ti) and VRAM temps dropped to max 80°C. So I hope it will be good.",
      "Maybe I should do that on my 3090 FTW3, VRAM gets up to 105+",
      "wtf is this Asus",
      "For a pre-scalped card, almost double MSRP, I would expect it to have a decently high QC level before going out. At least not have the gum-stick thermal pads which are complete junk. \n\nLove their motherboards, but honestly their GPUs are way overpriced for what you get.\n\nEdit: To break down what a rip-off their pricing is. Lets say they can't sell lower than the $1,100.00 MSRP on the physical bare reference card (press x to doubt), and they still have to pay the tariffs. So, 25% of 1,100 is $275.00, so $1,375 for the base card. Looking at their custom cooler, there's no way there's more than $50.00 in parts, but lets triple it to cover R&D, so $150.00 for the customer cooler. That should make that card realistically around $1500.00. Still overpriced but maybe it's a bit better than the FE design (press x to doubt).  \n\nBut they are selling this at $2,000.00. There's no way that custom cooler they put on a reference card costs $700.00. Even a top of a line EKWB solid nickel waterblock tops out at $280.00. Completely fucking scalped at the manufacturing level.",
      "Yeah that's scary hot. Watch out for junction temps, probably +10c.",
      "It's actually $1899 MSRP for the ASUS TUF. All the AIBs except EVGA have inflated their prices drastically.",
      "My gigabyte 3090 GPU die temps idled at 50-60c. Memory temps were fine, but I was blown away at the fact that this card which cost me $1750 had this issue straight out of the box. Absolutely unacceptable.\n\nIt seems clear every single GPU partner is rushing out as many of these cards as fast as possible and skimping everything but the most basic of QC. Even if it means an extra 2-6 cards a day right now thats a massive amount of money.",
      "post in the asus pc diy group on fb im sure juan could explain more",
      "Well done fixing it yourself so comprehensively, That extra pad made all the difference for me on the non Ti :)",
      "Tuf luck man damn \n\nFTFY",
      "Theres been a drop in quality control in many card makers recently and its not limited to nvidia gpus. the most hilarious oversight that I have seen was a finger glove from a worker serving as thermal pad",
      "those were faulty components. I actually have a 1080 FTW where the VRM blew up even with the extra thermal pads installed.",

Since I got a new motherboard, and I didn't want to get an Intel one to lock into Intel CPUs, I got an AMD one which meant I needed a new CPU. Since I needed a CPU, I needed new RAM since my old RAM wasn't compatible with the new CPU I wanted. Since I got a newer, higher-powered GPU, I needed a new power supply.\n\nAt that point, all that was left for me to get to build a new PC, assuming I was reusing my old storage, was to buy a new case. So I got that too with new fans, bought a cheap 1 TB SSD to put back in the old PC to replace the ones I was taking out, and boom, new PC. All because I was \"just\" buying a new GPU.",

    "selftext": "After noticing GDDR6X junction temperatures approaching 100C while gaming, I opened up my Zotac RTX 3080 Trinity OC today to replace the VRAM thermal pads. I’ve had to replace leaky, oily thermal pads on a couple different GPUs in the past, but nothing ever like this.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FHEGG75](https://imgur.com/a/FHEGG75)\n\nThis is my first (and probably last) Zotac card. I’m still not quite sure exactly what this is, but it seems like the thermal pads have literally started to disintegrate. Both the pads located on the GDDR6X modules and the backplate melted all over the place. It was a horrible mess, and I must’ve used at least 50 q-tips soaked in isopropyl alcohol in the attempt to clean up the residue. But I wasn’t able to get all of it even after an hour of picking away at it.\n\nI’ve had this 3080 for less than a month, and there’s no way that the thermal pads should be in this condition already. The GPU is installed in a high-airflow case with plenty of fans. I know GDDR6X temperature issues aren’t unique to Zotac products, but these thermal pads are simply inexcusable. Shame on them for choosing not to spend the extra 50 cents for non-garbage components.\n\nIf you have a Zotac RTX 3000-series card, i highly recommend you inspect the thermal pads and replace them ASAP. I used 2.0mm ~~Arctic~~ Fujipoly thermal pads (6 W/mK) for the VRAM, and double-stacked 1.5mm Arctic pads for the backplate. Memory junction temperatures have fallen by 12-15 degrees depending on the game.  \n\n*Edit (April 12, 2021): A lot of people have messaged me asking for thermal pad advice, so I'll just paste what I wrote to someone else here.* \n\n*In terms of quantity needed, you don't need a whole lot for a one-time replacement, just enough to cover the VRAM modules on both sides. I believe each 1GB module is 12x14 mm and there are ten of them. At the time, I couldn't find 3.0mm thermal pads (they are relatively expensive and harder to find), so I just stuck two 1.5mm pads together for the backplate.*\n\n*I bought a 145x145x1.5mm Arctic sheet + 150x100x2mm Fujipoly sheet. IMO, it doesn't really matter what brand you get, although the Gelid and Thermal Grizzly pads are generally considered to be the best enthusiast pads available. I would just go for something that's reasonably priced in terms of $/sq. mm.*",

Upside down Steve (from HU) mentioned in a recent video that they were literally refusing review samples from manufacturers, as to not piss off their audience, since people apparently got mad that they were reviewing cards most can’t buy.\n\nThis is why I disagree with that decision. Even if the product isn’t widely available, consumers should still get to make informed decisions based on the analyses of experts, who actually have the means to obtain said product. A lot of companies are getting away with shitty practices due to the lack of scrutiny. \n\nThis Zotac fiasco is just an example, but I honestly haven’t seen any reviewers stress testing the memory modules, comparing thermal pads (or, in some cases - like with Gigabyte -, the lack of them), etc. Most are producing some rather unusual content, especially during the launch windows of a bunch of new products.",

      "So from what I can tell, the whole \"New World blowing up thing\" was basically a design flaw by EVGA (aka the Fan controller).\n\nAs for other GPUs apparently also blowing up, it is a consequence of hardware limitation (be it AMD or Nvidia) when your GPU going to extreme level of FPS (>1000) and no hardware/software monitor can keep up with what is sub 1ms spikes in voltages / power. Hence the GPU might experience issues.",
      "Starting after driver 456.98 hotfix, a bug appeared in the driver (which may or may not be related to some sort of inner design issue) on ALL cards (3080 and 3090 at that time), where a power limit: thermal flag would be incorrectly triggered.  It was determined by someone on [overclock.net](https://overclock.net) that this flag would ONLY randomly occur during a GPU load change of some sort.  This bug STILL exists on the latest Nvidia drivers.\n\nOn non eVGA cards, this would cause the power limit:thermal flag to be set.  This could be seen in GPU-Z as a single \"Magenta\" blip, which if you hovered over it, would show \"thermal\".\n\nHowever on eVGA cards, you would see the actual temperature that is causing this thermal flag directly on the ICX sensors.  It would show up on any of them randomly, with a temperature reading between 105C to 6500C.  There were multiple screenshots of this posted over in the eVGA forums in the 3090 FTW3 mega long bios thread.\n\nThis bug started with the VERY FIRST 457.xx driver branch.  Driver 456.98 hotfix was NOT affected by this bug.  I noticed this very instantly on my 3090 FE when I first saw the 457.xx driver release and tested a beta version and then the game ready version.  It bugged me to see it (although I noticed no actual throttling or performance issues when it happened)  but went back to 456.98 hotfix anyway.\n\nOne way I noticed to see the issue was to run Heaven Benchmark for a few loops then expand the GPU-Z power limit area.  Heaven has a ton of frame hitches on all cards (both AMD and Nvidia) in the exact same areas, so it's easier to see this here.  Another way to see it is after you close the Heaven benchmark and watch the card cool down.  But this requires that you have \"prefer maximum performance\" (note: this requires a reboot in order to actually take effect when changed) set enabled in the Nvidia drivers, so the card does NOT downclock back to 210 mhz!  That way, the card will still be running at full speed and the V/F curve and GPU core clocks will keep adjusting as the card cools down.  This is enough to trigger the \"thermal\" flag randomly sometimes.\n\nI absolutely DO NOT know whether the fan 1 speed overspeed report on eVGA cards is related to this, triggers because of this, or a completely different issue!  I am not seeing a thermal flag on Igor's gpu-z screenshots when this happens, but some people in the eVGA thread said that their fan ramped up to 100% speed very momentarily (when fan control was on automatic) when the very high VRM temp blips occurred, which is what you would expect.  But not a 50,000 RPM report....\n\nI at the time (late last year and very early this year) suggested that perhaps the eVGA cards randomly dying (usually in older games like League of Legends, Halo: MCC, GTA5 and Final Fantasy 14), was somehow related to this VRM overtemp reporting bug somehow.  However, a few users on the eVGA forums said their cards black screened in League / Halo MCC, even when they were using 456.98 hotfix or the Game Ready 456.xx driver before it (where there were no VRM overtemp reporting issues occurring), and I have no idea if the fan overspeed issue was happening or not.  So again, it could be two flaws happening here, with one affecting all 3080/3090 cards , regardless of AIB, but not killing hardware (Extreme overtemp blips causing Thermal flags), and a second specifically related to eVGA's controllers.\n\nSo again, I have absolutely no idea whether the >456.98 hotfix VRM temp bug (affects all cards) and eVGA issue are related or not.  (456.98 and older were not affected by the temp bug at least).  You can't use such old drivers on some games anyway (some may complain, some may not).   For Honor, for example, wouldn't even load on any Ampere driver before 456.98 hotfix (which was one of the reasons for the hotfix to begin with).",
      "Jesus Christ.\n\nIs EVGA going to update and distribute a BIOS to fix this ? Or is it impossible to fix with a BIOS update?",
      "So many issues with evga this gen, poor quality caps, poor voltage regulation and now this.",

      "Cept, most of them will be under warranty still surely, and just be a giant rma swap consumer to consumer.",
      "I am seriously getting annoyed with EVGA....\n\nMy 1080 GTX was part of those cards that black screened and went to jet level fan speed. EVGA was dismissing it for ages until those hot spot images started coming out. Then they finally admitted that a batch of components on the cards were out of spec causing the safety to trip early. That whole stupid thermal pad crap replacement kit they did before that was also probably bullshit just to have to avoid to actually start fixing the faulty cards.",
      "Wait, I may just be misinformed but, why couldn’t they fix this through a BIOS/GPU update? Couldn’t they just force a maximum speed limit on the fans?",
      "Well better not touch any new releases because it ain't the game's fault",
      "software being able to destory hardware is always a hardware issue. no circumstance should there be a halt and explode instruction.",
      "Still ridiculous that the gpu safeguards don't shut it down when it overheats, regardless of any fan issue",
      "EVGA did it's own thing, trying to be over the nvidia recommended specs for protection, but it ended up by backfiring spectacularly. A result of the clusterduck they did with the 1080's when they had to little protection.",
      "So glad that Jay's nonsensical Tweet is front and center in this article. He was a huge catalyst in spreading the capacitor misinformation during the 3000 series launch, and here he is again getting caught with his foot directly in his mouth.\n\nI am an EVGA 3090 FTW Ultra owner and really appreciated EVGA's proactiveness in creating the queue very early in the shortages, and I've always agreed with Jay that EVGA does right by consumers with their RMA process.\n\nHowever, Jay's video and Tweets about this whole thing where he completely blames Amazon and deliberately avoids placing any blame on EVGA feels SO much like clout-chasing/being an enormous shill. It's actually incredible and I'll never watch his videos again.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting.\n\nThe real question now is what is EVGA going to do for us owners whose cards haven't popped yet? It's only a matter of time. I think the only thing that has saved me is that I have a GSYNC monitor (stopping old games from driving the framerate into the thousands), which is incredibly fortunate because I have played many hours of Halo MCC (which is one of the games that's been soliciting this behaviour from the cards).",
      "$4k GPU? Damn you get scalped or live in an expensive country?",
      "so happy this is finally getting the attention it deserves. I love EVGA but... had 3x3090 ftw3 ultra break. Weeks of downtime and being told by EVGA it must be something else. If the card breaks again they may not honor it. Sold the last RMA I got back and switched to a kingpin.  3 months later and still no issues.\n\nPeople in the EVGA forums were blaming games like gta5 a few months back also. I have 8 pages of registered cards with EVGA(i like them). This gen their high end is anything but.",
      "Simplest solution to this is to go to your global GPU settings and limit the framerate to the refreshrate of your monitor.",
      "Their 1080 GTXs weren't that particularly good either with the thermal issues as well as the black screen + jet fans hardware issue."

So in other words, I can have the fans at 60% speed, but average GPU core clocks will be reduced as a result as opposed to upping the fan speed. Also, I have a feeling that the card is being tamed at the BIOS level, as even with stock fans (with the card at default settings), the temperatures never went past 60°C.*\n\n***EDIT:***\n\nI RECOMMEND THIS MOD, but this statement is kind of subjective.\n\nI've determined that the high pitch noise was caused by none other than coil whine. Noctua fans are performing strongly here, not too loud under load either. I've seen reports that even the \"higher tiered\" Asus Strix cards suffer from coil whine, so take it as it comes I guess.\n\nStock (brushless motor?) fans on the Colorful iGame RTX 3080 Advanced OC were actually pretty good and definitely performed up to the task. This is definitely one of the more underrated cards on the market. Only problem with stocks fans is that they sounded like they kept \"scraping\" or \"brushing\" on something when spinning and it trigged my OCD as a result.\n\nMost of coil whine noise gets filtered out if you have it under a desk or hard surface, so it's not really a nuisance, unless you have a pre-existing condition, then the noise would be debilitating. With the Noctuas fans at a 100% fan speed, they still sound great, and perform well. They don't have that sound like jet plane taking off (being me back to 1080Ti FE blower style days).\n\nIf playing with headphones on or speakers, most of the fan  noise gets washed away in the background.\n\nI've had to take my headphones off to check if the fans were still spinning when I had them at 70% speed.\n\n**More edits:** Also at some point I tried two Noctua NF-A14 industrialPPC-2000 IP67 PWM (140mm) on this GPU.  I don't suggest installing anything other than 92mm for this generation of cards to be honest.\n\nAs a fellow Redditor here mentioned, these fans will move more air at lower RPMs than the regular cooler does, so you actually get better cooling and lower noise vs the stock cooler.\n\n*If you're wondering, the stock fans were the Foxconn PVA080E12R-P44-GD and the PVA080E12R-P43-JD *\n\n**What I've tested so far**\n\n* **x3 NF-R8 redux-1800 PWM**\n* **x2 NF-A14 industrialPPC-2000 IP67 PWM**\n* **x3 NF-A9 PWM chromax.black.swap**\n\nI don't recommend those NF-A14.",

They destroyed my Mainboard and shipped it anyway to me, then I had to RMA it again so they can replace the broken Mainboard. That took 6 weeks until the RMA was completed. The most frustrating experience was with their customer support either their phone is completely blocked so you need to try at a later time and when you get through you need 1,5h to 2h until you can speak to some representative. Never ever I am gonna get something from them again. Sadly I learned my lesson."

    "title": "RTX 3080 Buyer's Mini Guide: Which 3080 do I get?",
    "selftext": "Was suggested I make this by someone so here it is.\n\n**You want a RTX 3080**, *but you don't know which one to get*. With RTX 3080 stock being almost non existent, the answer here in most cases is.. the one that you can get, unless you don't mind waiting. In all honesty, you're fine getting almost any RTX 3080 as long as you aren't paying anything outrageous for it, because they all perform within a few percent of each other. If there's ANYTHING to take away from this guide, it's that the 3080 has little to no headroom, so there's *verrryy* little difference between most of the partner RTX 3080 cards. Any extra money you spend on a \"better\" model will not go very far, and that's because the 3080 seems to scale *TERRIBLY* with more power than it's already given target TDP. You will have a much louder and power hungry card for only a few fps more if you try to overclock.\n\nLet's pretend these video cards will be in stock soon, and you want to make an informed decision. I'll make a breakdown of what I already know from my too many hours of free time spent googling things. This is by no means a complete guide, but it is close to semi-complete and can be used as a starting point in your search for the 3080 card that best fits your needs. Hopefully with a little more user input, and more information revealed with time I can make this into a more complete guide (I will try to keep updating this as I learn more things).\n\n**The All Rounder**\n\n* *Asus TUF*\n\nIf you wanted a short and sweet tl;dr, the answer is just to get an **Asus TUF**, which is retailing at $699 MSRP. This is the all rounder choice. Great cooler that easily outclasses even more expensive cards, none of the other cards in the same price bracket come close in db normalized cooling results (the quiet bios is kick ass imo). Comes with dual bios, which you wont find in any other card at this MRSP, and also has a higher TDP limit (370w) than pretty much all the other similarly priced 3080 cards. There are better cards than this one (as you'll find out below if you keep reading), but the difference between them and this one is *sooo* small that you're better off saving the difference in money to spend elsewhere.. I think most reviewers will agree with me here. I may add one or two more all rounders here in the future if any come close value wise. PS Current reviews are for the TUF OC model. I believe the only difference is factory overclock (if it is, just get the cheaper one), but I could be wrong, and the difference might be the power limit set by the bios. Hopefully someone can confirm this for us soon. Edit: just confirmed it, the max power limit is the same for both models. Don't bother spending extra for the OC model. \n\n**The slower ones?**\n\n* *MSI Ventus, Zotac Trinity*\n\nSo the slower ones.. aren't really that much slower. Literally like 1-2% slower than FE, be it to a bad cooler design, or purposely gimped by a low power limit. Seriously, you're fine getting whatever card if you can at least get it close to $699. Don't be put off by getting like 0.5-1 fps less. However I will say, that there's no reason to get any of these cards if the TUF is available at it's MSRP price. Currently in this list we have the **MSI Ventus** and **Zotac Trinity**. I believe there are a few cards I've missed, so I will add them to this list as I find them. Who knows, the ones gimped by lower power limits could possibly be worked around with bios flash in the future, but I wouldn't risk voiding warranty just for 1-2% more performance.\n\n**The Compact Cards**\n\n* *Founders Edition, and EVGA XC3*\n* *Honorable mentions: Asus TUF, and PNY XLR8 EPIC-X*\n\nNow here's a category that I think is worth considering important, because there are going to be some of us working with less case space than others. To see a comprehensive spreadsheet detailing the various dimensions of most of the different RTX 3080 models we have available check out the one that  [u/MattVanAndel](https://www.reddit.com/user/MattVanAndel/) has made [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-JXCyCCUyrmtnH0hOLZStrE2mljLHConizXGL-ysKDzbH_aCWynoOwWqRtnPEDE0Tp6KIm8xVFfRJ/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true). The king here is by far the **Founders Edition**, nothing comes close in compactness. The smallest partner model is the **EVGA XC3**, however beware that the black edition does not come with a backplate. The **Asus TUF and PNY XLR8 EPIC-X** are also fairly compact relative to their peers, so I've added them as honorable mentions. EDIT: Was brought to my attention that the FE might be a no go for some sandwhich style SFF cases. Keep that in mind if you're building in a SFF case, the FE may not be for you. \n\n**I got money to blow for a few percent more of performance**\n\n* *EVGA FTW3, Asus Strix, Gigabyte Aorus, probably a few others I missed*\n\nJoke title aside, some of these models may be good for better thermal/acoustic balance, letting you game with less noise. I think we will need more reviews to be certain about which models will be best for this, I think I will give this a separate section once we have more info. For now, silent cooling can easily be accomplished with a custom fan profile and negligible performance penalties on most cards already. The EVGA FTW3 has already claimed overclocking records on live stream with gamersnexus. The strix and Aorus will without a doubt have very high power limits as well, and great PCBs. Im not too sure about the Aorus cooler yet, but if the TUF and previous Strix models is any indicator of what the Strix might be I don't think we have to worry about the Strix not being an amazing card. These are currently your best choices for top end partner cards as they have better components on their PCBs, usually better coolers (this can be a hit or a miss), and probably most importantly, higher max power limits with the addition of an extra 8 pin connector. Should you spend extra for any of these cards? Unless you really like how one of these looks (good help your soul if you like the FTW3 for it's looks), or *realllyyy reallllyy* want a few percent extra performance and that *very* tiny bit of extra OC headroom, cause you're a \"hardcore overclocker\", I wouldn't bother paying extra for one of these. I guess there is that third category you could fit too, where you just buy shiny things to make yourself feel better like myself (hence my strix preorder lol). I may have missed a few cards here, but as more cards are released and reviewed I will be able to update this list with my findings.\n\n**Cards with Caveats**\n\n* *MSI Ventus/Trio, EVGA Black Edition*\n\nThese are the weirdo cards. Let me explain. The **EVGA XC3 Black Edition** does ***NOT*** come with a backplate, if that's important to you, skip this card. The **MSI Ventus/Trio** cards come with backplates.. but they are not metal, they're some sort of plastic. Now you know. These might be things to consider when making a purchase. I will add other cards here if I find anymore weirdo cards. Edit: there's been some discussion on the backplates of the msi cards. These are graphene composite, mostly plastic but advertised for the use of graphene to have thermal benefits. Personally I'm skeptical and don't think there's any really benefit to be had over the metal backplates + thermal pads but you guys be the judge. \n\n**In the Middle**\n\n* *Pretty much everything else*\n\nThis is where most cards fit, right in the middle. This includes the TUF, and the Gaming X Trio, but the big difference is, one is cheaper than the other. The Gaming X Trio does *very* slightly better in most benchmarks and overclock a bit better, likely due to the extra 8 pin connector, but its too close to be worth the extra cost, worse thermals and plastic backplate. What *CAN* make it worth it is the warranty. If you like MSI warranty more than Asus warranty, I think this easily makes the Gaming X Trio worth the extra cost. See the section where I discuss warranty below. I think if a vbios flash mod to raise the max power limit ever becomes available for the gaming x trio that it could become the best value \"overclockers\" card since it is the cheapest triple 8 pin model, making it perfect for slapping an aftermarket cooler or waterblock on. I will add more cards to the discussion here as more reviews surface for the other difference models. PS the difference between the \"ultra\" and \"gaming\" EVGA cards seem to only be factory overclock. As far as I'm aware that's the only difference, but one may have a higher max power limit for all I know. Some claim that the factory overclocked versions are binned better, but EVGA themselves had said that there's no difference between the two in binning. Either way, the silicon lottery wont discriminate between the two so I say just go with the cheaper version. The Gigabyte Gaming OC is a great in the middle card I think, it costs a bit more than the TUF, but comes with a year longer warranty and also has a dual bios switch. I still think the TUF is a better choice cause of its cheaper price, but pricing isnt going the same everywhere so this is another card you can consider if it's cheaper. PS some gigabyte and asus cards come with an extra HDMI, if this is something useful to you that's something to consider. The eagle is pretty decent card too. I think I need to split this category into two soon, for the better in the middle cards and just average ones. \n\nEdit: some people seem to think I'm sleeping on the msi x trio. It's a good card but I don't think it's as good as the cards in the higher performance bracket. The main reason being is poor max power limit (only 350w). Everything else about it is good. It runs fairly cool, not the best cooler but it's good, and it  is a very quiet card. Also comes with one of the highest if not highest factory overclock. This makes it a good middle bracket card, but still not as good as the very top end ones which have much higher max power limits. I stand by what I said before, it's a great card that's slightly better than the tuf but at a premium. I've also got word that the power components on the PCB aren't as good as some of the other cards BUT I have not confirmed this myself so take this with a grain of salt. It's still a good card regardless. \n\n**I want a needlessly overkill card that comes installed with a waterblock**\n\n* *EVGA Hydro Copper, MSI Corsair, and Gigabyte Aorus Waterforce*\n\nThese are not available yet, but they are confirmed to be coming ~~soon~~ (who knows when). These typically feature very good PCBs and are paired with a waterblock. I can't tell you which one will be better. I couldn't even tell you which ones were better for previous generations, and I've looked. PS The MSI Corsair is the successor to the MSI Seahawk line, and will believe it or not, feature a Corsair waterblock. I believe there will be some AIO type models coming too. I'll update this portion of the guide when I get more information.\n\n**Cards that will get Waterblocks**\n\n* *Founders Edition, Reference PCB cards, Asus Strix, MSI Ventus and MSI Gaming X Trio, Asus TUF, EVGA XC3, Zotac Trinity*\n\nI don't know too much about what cards will get waterblocks even though I do plan on watercooling a 3080 in a custom loop myself. Figured I should throw what I do know here anyways because it might help someone. The two most obvious ones, **FE** cards, and reference cards, most big block manufacturers will have blocks for both. A lot of you know this already but I should clarify anyways for the uninitiated, but the **FE** cards are ***NOT*** reference PCB, they are a custom nvidia design and will need a different waterblock. As for figuring out which cards have reference designs.. just look up any reference rtx 3080 waterblock and see what cards it supports. EK has confirmed a block for the **Strix**, and Alphacool has confirmed that they are making blocks for **MSI Ventus** and **Gaming x Trio**. Edit: EK has also confirmed upcoming waterblocks for the **Asus TUF** and **EVGA XC3**. The FE blocks will follow shortly after. The zotac trinity will also be getting a block from both ek and bykski. \n\nUpdate: Confirmation on upcoming blocks from u/Eddy-Alphacool\n>We are working right now on blocks for:\n>\n>Asus ROG Strix RTX 3080  \n>Asus TUF RTX 3080\n>\n>Founders Edition 3080  \n>Founders Edition 3090 \n>\n>Gigabyte Eagle RTX 3080  \n>Gigabyte Gaming OC RTX 3080\n>\n>MSI Ventus 3X  RTX 3080  \n>MSI Gaming X Trio RTX 3080  \n>\n>\n>Presale will start in the next 2 weeks. They will be available mid/end october!\n\n**Let's Talk Warranty** (WIP/Very Opinionated/Take with a grain of salt)\n\nThis is without a doubt one of the best ways to choose your video card, even more so for the 3080, where there is very negligible performance difference between most of the different partner models. I don't know which models have longer than standard warranty as I admittedly have not looked into this too far yet, but I do know some cards like the **Gigabyte Gaming OC** come with 4 years of warranty. Most credit cards will offer you extended warranty on purchases made on those cards too. From what I understand Asus has bad RMA customer service (sad considering how great the TUF is). Community consensus seems to be that EVGA has the best customer service and that MSI also has great RMA service for video cards (can confirm this, MSI replaced my broken blower 1080 ti that I bought used with a ventus gp 2080 ti for free, no questions asked or any hassle). There are probably others with bad or good service, and I can't tell you which one will be better. I suggest doing your own research and picking the brand you feel most comfortable with warranty wise.\n\nCredit u/darkpriest\n\n>Just to add, ZOTAC offers 3 + 2 years warranty (total 5 years) for most of the countries except USA.  \n>  \n>Asus has a 3 + 1 year warranty (total 4 years) for some parts of the world.\n\nSince I'm calling this a \"close to semi-complete guide\" discussion and questions aren't only welcome, but encouraged! This guide can be improved a lot more with input from you guys.\n\nEDIT: Adding a bonus piece on power supplies since we get a lot of of is my power supply enough questions here.\n\n**Do I need a new power supply?!?!?!?!?!?!!**\n\nWhat power supply you will need will largely depend on how power hungry the rest of your system is (namely your CPU), but you more than likely don't need anything crazy, trust me on that.  On a tame system with something like a ryzen 3600 all you need is a decent 550w power supply. Focus on getting something that is good quality and reliable over higher wattage, this is more important than getting as many watts as you can. There are tier lists and PSU reviews that can help you find a good power supply. If you have a big power hog like a very heavily overclocked i9-10900k all you need is a *good* 600w or better power supply, and this is very clearly shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdohv96uGLw) in optimum tech's video. If you have a lot of peripherals/add-ons or are just a very anxious person you can err on the side of caution and get an extra 50 watts more than you need. Just make sure it's a **GOOD** power supply. If you're wondering why nvidia has grossly exaggerated their recommended power supply specifications it's probably because of how many terrible cheap power supplies there are available, that a lot of uninformed people end up buying. *Source: have built many computers with both crappy cheap high wattage psus and good ones with lower wattages.*\n\nPS Connect your dual 8 pin cards with sperate cables if you can, don't use a single daisy chained one. See the diagram below on how to connect your 3080 to your PSU.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xp4zxywjzeo51.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=17233e280702a26f458a8265bd5d7d1823e17b8a\n\n*Source: I have too much free time and have been too obsessed with the rtx 3080*",

I just realised that the NVlink ports occupy different positions on different cards. I couldn't find any lists for all the dimensions to check for compatibilities. Do you have an idea. It's a headache because I'm already restricted to another water-cooled GPU and a 3 slot bridge because the TRX40 Master mono prefers to have a 1x PCie at the 4 slot distance. Other possibility, to use two risers for the cards, but I'm weary, because the radiator with fans of the 3090ti is already 'improvised' outside the case. Do you know how i would fix the cards properly when using risers? The casing slots are then meant to be taped shut (i know, originally risers where meant for vertical GPU setup). \n\nThank you very much! ",

Or does it just look like this on the images?)\n\nThanks!",

      "Sigh.\n\nYes the 4090 might actually be better FPS per $, but calling a $1600+ GPU a 'better value' and 'bang for buck performance' is disgusting. \n\nI hate this launch, but AMD coming up short with performance means they likely wont be much better. Duopolies suck.",
      "The 4090 is 38.7% faster in raytraced 4K, which means it's a better value at $1600 vs $1200.  Considering most people are buying these cards to play games at 4K with raytracing, you're get more bang for buck performance with the 4090, plus 24 GB VRAM.",
      "Thanks. 18-20% faster than 3090 Ti, 28% faster than 3090, and 48% faster than 3080 at. Gap grows with RT, 32% faster than 3090 at 1440p, which is DLSS Quality base resolution at 4k. \n\nPeople here are going to hate it, but the 4080 is selling out in the US for online retailers. Best Buy, Amazon, Newegg, all models at MSRP are gone. That doesn't go along with what some dumbass Techtubers say though, and the narrative that we want to believe. Even physical stores the MSRP models are gone, leaving only the heavily overpriced cards. In the coming months, I think AIB 4080 will remain at MSRP or under, and the 4090 will cast away its msrp models.\n\n7900XTX is likely to be 5-10% faster going with these results for $200 less at msrp. If the 4090 wasn't available and I absolutely had to pick one, the 4080 is a very easy choice between the two. DLSS3/DLAA, faster RT, and all the extras when it comes to software.",
      "The 4000 series really dumped all its stat points into raytracing.",
      "Its a great 4k card nevermind 1440p.",
      "How is it not bad? This is a new generation. You should be getting lower end cards that beat the high end of last gen for LESS. Otherwise what is the point? Will the 5090 be $3000?\n\nThe 1070 was equal to the 980Ti for $300 less, the 2060 was equal to a 1080 for $300 less...",
      "Mate, where have been the last 5 years? Last time GPU prices made sense was Pascal",
      "So 4070ti will be on par with 3090ti for $899?",
      "So twice the cost of the last gen cards and 30 percent more performance.\n\nAND less value for money than the overpriced 4090. \n\nGreat",
      "Here's a crazy stat for you. Do you wanna know how much more expensive the 3090ti was over the 2080ti? 800$. \n\nYou're literally comparing it to the largest price increase in the history of graphics cards. Ever. And I'm now comparing that with the other largest price increase, ever, in the 2080Ti compared to the 1080ti. Close to 3x in 2 gens, and now you're applauding nvidia for making 1000+ the new mid range. Fantastic.\n\nEven at 1000$ the 4080 is a hard pass.",
      "Came from a 2080ti + waterblock. I'm ashamed to say I'm used to these prices now 😔",
      "If the price goes down on the 4080 it’ll be a great 1440p card. But looking at this.. just get an ampere card or an amd card",
      "it's pretty close to raster tbh\n\n3080 10GB probably just didn't have enough memory to cut it at 4k RT, but at 1440p RT it seems pretty close in the percentages with raster\n\nand for the 4090, I suspect the raster perf is sometimes still bottlenecked even at 4k, and the card stretches its legs more often with RT on",
      ">30 percent more performance.\n\nMinor nitpick, but that's not now percentages work. You divide by the lower number, not subtract it from 100%.\n\nIf you scroll down it even says the 4080 is **48.8% faster** than the 3080 at 4k and **45.1% faster** than 3080 10GB at 1440p",
      "Just get a 3080 if you want to game at 1440p. Or wait for the upcoming 4080 12GB... I mean 4070Ti.",
      "There is too much performance gap to label it the Ti",
      "To even give further context the 2060 wasn't particularly well received for its hefty price increase (there's a pattern here somewhere) over the 1060. And still superior value compared to Ada.",
      "No points in charisma, smh",
      "If you're spending over $1k, it really doesn't make much sense to go with the 4080 to be fair.\n\nI'm not so sure that Nvidia's plan to reset the high end at above $1k will work, as those willing to spend that much will want the best, not the distant 2nd.",

      "I think everyones getting a bit caught up in the difference between the Vram on the 90 and the 80. Looking at those specs, there really arent a lot of things that gamers will do to max out the 10GB (potentially in certain circumstances but i would imagine few and far between) Nvidia really cant launch the 3080 with 20GB (10 or 20 is only option at 320 bus i believe) as its just gonna be way too close to the 3090. Looking at the size of the 3090 it seems to me like Nvidia know the performance difference between these two cards isnt actually going to be that great so they shoved the VRAM up massively, stuck a massive cooler on it and threw a load more electricity through it in the hope to justify the price tag. I think the 3080 may surprise people here and will be the better buy, even if i dont agree with the prices of any of them. If it turns out the 10GB isnt enough can probably sell in 2-3 months for a 20GB AIB and lose £50-£100",

If any of you are curious I'll give you a rundown of all the JANK!\n\nThis build was once beautiful, but now it's Frankenstein's monster! For dead silence I put it under my desk, it has 2 360mm radiators, and an optimized fan setup I tested thoroughly (6 exhaust, 3 intake. Negative pressure I know but it performed notably better when souly watercooling my 5700xt, even th\nhen the ddr6 pumped a lot of heat out and the AMD backplate had no thermal pads, never bought an EK one). One of the radiator has different spinning fan speeds ( a different fan in the middle too ha!) to avoid harmonizing sounds, like what the mac pro does. The rest of the fans are standard maglevs which were going for reeeally cheap in 2 packs at PLE (Aussie PC store). All fans spin super slow like 600 - 800 RPM, and the last gpu in there (5700XT) was watercooled. The res is a bay res on its side coz pump res combos are a damn rip off and that with a pump mount was cheaper, and fit well in my old silverstone huge aluminium case I forgst the name of lol. Now it sits on a bit of rubber to absorb vibrations. My Z370 board is meh, hence the fan for more airflow over the VRMS but the 8700k is delided with liquid metal, I've had it rock solid with a mild OC (4.7Ghz, 1.21V) for a good two years now! For all the triggered folk do not panic, I'm going to re do the loop with black rubber tubing and clean it all up when I get a waterblock for the 3090, but for the record as jank as it is it's rock solid stable and is cleaned regularly, I had a show case build, I got bored and started experimenting haha.\n\nPS the middle tubes are ziptied together to pull one up as it was hitting the fan on the 3090 that thing is HUGE!\n\nMuch love reddit!",

      "What a brutal review! And all of it well deserved. Nvidia did not need to hype this card for 8k gaming.",
      "That's why I trust GN over other youtube reviewers. \"8K gaming card\", yeah only with DLSS and Nvidia handpicked titles. Pretty sure 3080, hell even 2080Ti is capable of \"8K\" with DLSS and toning down the settings to medium.\n\nThis should've been marketed as a professional card. Not a gaming card. It's at best 15% faster than 3080 at 4K, but costs more than twice over the 3080. An utterly pointless \"Gaming Card\". But I'm sure there are few Jeff Bezos out there who'd buy this ridiculous card for \"Gaming\".",
      "Except it's not really that either.  Watch the LTT 3090 review.  TLDW: When inquired NVIDIA told LTT that the \"3090 is not a Titan-class product and thus will not be receiving our Titan-specific driver optimizations.\" This response when Linus inquired as to why last-gen's RTX Titan was OUTPERFORMING THE 3090 in specific professional workloads.",
      "Just gonna copy my comment from the hardware sub:\n\nOnly a few minutes in and this is really brutal. Mostly about how this shouldn't have been marketed as a gaming card and how he disagrees with NVIDA marketing. They claimed 8K gaming so that is what he tested it as and well... I would just watch the video.\n\nThese gaming benchmarks are just awful for price/performance. If you only game, don't get this card. If you're worried about future proofing with more VRAM get a 3080 and upgrade sooner. It will be better and you might even save money in the long run. If you have the money to do whatever you want, I guess go for it. But if you were someone who wanted a 3080 but didn't get it on launch and thinking of stretching your budget for this, don't.",

They asked NVIDIA about it and NVIDIA responded that \"Titan cards receive specific driver optimizations.  The 3090 is not a Titan-class card and will not be receiving those driver optimizations.\"\n\nReally shitty thing to do to people who are purchasing this card for professional workloads and expecting the Titan-like performance optimizations.....\n\n**EDIT W/ TIME-STAMPED LINK FOR THOSE CALLING ME OUT:**\n\n[https://youtu.be/YjcxrfEVhc8?t=588](https://youtu.be/YjcxrfEVhc8?t=588)",
      "What did we learn today?\n\n\n\n\n\nWait for benchmarks, always.",

So over 4 years you spent $800.\n\nIf you sell a 4090 after 4 years you might get $300-$500.  So it costs you $1000-$1200.\n\nIt's because bigger gpus depreciate more over time because the gpus that Nvidia will later release that match them are so much cheaper.",
      "The thing people need to keep in mind is that the 3080 / 3090 only have a clear advandage in floating point compute. (not sure about half precision).\n\nDouble precision float and integer performance is not much faster than the 2080ti, so it is not surprising that performance is underwhelming in specific suites.",

It's a tad on the confusing side but most 4k \"quality\" AAA titles don't use but around 3-5GB of VRAM. This is the way most graphic architecture are programmed. It will reserve a large portion of the GPU VRAM for instantaneous usage but it's not 100% being used at any point. More  efficient programming would fix this issue but I wouldn't worry about texture resolution or graphic fidelity on 10GB VRAM any time soon. \\*\\*VR VRAM utilize would start encroaching on that limitation though with 10GB.

Recently upgraded my 1080ti FTW3 to this brick.\n\nSpecs:\n\n* Asus WS X299 PRO Motherboard\n* 128gb Corsair Vengeance LPX 2666 RAM\n* Intel i7 9800x running at 4.7GHz on all cores, thanks to...\n* ...Alphacool Eisbaer LT360 AIO w/ 3x Corsair ML Series ML120 Pro Fans\n* Nvidia RTX3090 FE\n* Corsair RM850x PSU\n* Various M2 and SATA SSDs\n* Fractal Design R6 Case\n\n/////////////\n\nEDIT:\n\nWas not expecting this kind of response! Thanks folks!\n\nTo answer some of the main questions:\n\n\\- I need the RAM because After Effects.\n\n\\- The card is a huge step up from my 1080ti, but that is still a great card, don't get me wrong.\n\n\\- temps are good\n\n\\- For rendering I use Cycles in Blender, C4D's built in renderers, Adobe Media Encoder. I am considering a move to Redshift or Arnold. TBH most of my animation work to date has been 2d motion graphics so this has only recently become a consideration.\n\n\\- I run a professional studio and have about 15 years in the industry, so while this is a high end rig, it pays for itself in time savings. The difference in render time and smoothness of workflow, particularly in After Effects is worth the price of admission for my use case. The contents of this box is literally my livelihood. I am not rich!\n\n\\- I have noticed a big performance bump with ACC in VR. That is pretty much the only game I play or have time to play. I used to do a lot more gaming.\n\n\\- I bought the card from Scan in the UK, using PartAlert on Twitter to notify me of stock availability. I turned on desktop notifications and moved quickly when the notification came in.\n\n\\- I would be lying if I said I wasn't tempted to flip the card. I mean who wouldn't be? But ultimately I wanted the card in my machine working for me now, rather than maybe getting a card sometime in the future, possibly long after that extra £1k has been spent on shit I don't need. Plus, I don't want to contribute to scalping. Easy money usually means someone else is getting fucked over and that doesn't sit right with me.\n\n\\- No mining for me. I do have a small crypto portfolio (ADA and ETH, in case anyone is wondering), but I can't stand the damn noise when mining and it takes my machine out of action. HODLing is a much easier and cheaper way to make money with crypto for me.",

These are insane times right now!\n\nReally didn't need the 3090 but I also upgraded to a G-Sync 34\" 3440x1440 monitor and I like high frame rates with lots of eye candy. The 2070S couldn't do Cyberpunk justice!",
      "How does the card perform, I have the same 1080ti as you, I know it would be a big jump in performance but should I wait for the 4000 series?\n\nCause if I'm gonna wait, I'm going to get the 3090 successor at whatever  price it maybe.",

      "The retailers in Canada are selling the 3090 TI for $2599.99, the cheapest today is $2050\n\nThe 4080 is $1699.99 in the same store.\n\nThere's something very strange and very wrong with this picture, previous gens cards prices are barely moving. $600+ for a 3060? Get fucked.",
      "Yep.\n\n\nAlso, when the 4090 is the best price for performance option, we have a problem.",
      "Cards DOA if it's 899, ah who am I kidding there will be a smorgasbord of people posting \"Just upgraded from a 30X0!\" builds",
      "If you own a 30x0 card, I'm begging you to not buy this generation unless the prices actually come down from last gen. Please don't further enable Nvidias shit pricing",
      "Honestly, these kinds of posts are so bizarre to me. Are we supposed to cheer a random person that they've spent money? Do they want us to be envious? Jealous? Why do people need to post every pointless bit of their lives online. Sorry for rant :(",

      "Octane performance is always faster than game performance, as its not held by CPU and other stuff. In a way, it reflects true computing performance of the GPU better than games, but obviously, if you care only about games, awesome Octane numbers wont help you.\n\nI presume 4070Ti scores about 720 points then - since vanilla 3090 is cca 650. Not bad. 3090 would still be better choice, if priced similarly, cause 24GB of vram.",
      "Bro seriously?!? You could have easily gotten $100+ more for that card.",
      "So the 4080 is 35% faster than 3090 Ti in this benchmark, but according to reviews it's roughly 25% faster in games.\n\nSo in non-DLSS 3 games the 4070 Ti will more than likely compete with the 3080 Ti/3090 rather than the 3090 Ti.",

      "depends where you are? I see some new 3060ti going for 400 in USA. can't say I know anyone that would dish out 350 for a 3060",
      "Nvidia is really just gonna give us 1 to 1 price to performance increase this generation........ \n\nWelp hopefully the 4070ti flops like the 4080 too so we can get price drops next year",
      "Yeah I don't get anything that is happening now. You can’t find any cards in stores except for 3060 and 3060ti and those are ridiculous expensive still for some reason and nobody wants them for those prices. They said after mining that there would no longer be gpu shortages yet it’s as bad now or worse than it was a year ago. I want a 4090 and have only been able to find a 4080 which just isn’t cutting the mustard and is going back soon. Still no luck 3-4 months later after launch finding one and even 4080s fly off the shelves in the states. Once the 3000 series glut was gone they said we’d start seeing 4090s but those have been gone for a month or more now and still ain’t shit on the shelves.",
      "Oh I won’t. Consoles are the target for most games anyways. 30x0 will be fine until ps6",
      "Scalpers/ex-miners need to cut their losses and move on. There is no excuse for any 3000-series card, in any configuration, selling for more than a 4070ti, yet if you look online, you routinely find people doing just that, likely trying to scam unsuspecting victims. It's despicable.",
      "not everywhere, in Spain (like in many other countries) you can buy a 1390€ 4080, but the cheapest 4090 would be 2000€, 43% more expensive for around 40% more performance, if you're lucky, actually most 4090s are priced 2100€+",
      "Generally speaking, flagship products don't offer the best price to performance. That's usually for midrange products",
      "So basically you can get that performance with an overclocked 3090 and also have double the vram",
      "There was an interview with the Nvidia CFO a couple of weeks ago in a German gaming site where she basically admitted that Nvidia stopped shipping the 3000 series to keep the price stable. Funny thing is prices never even went under MSRP. these mf don't want the price to drop at this point so consumers don't realize how much they get scammed by nvidia. Maybe they scrap, reuse or write the overstock of the 3000 series off as a loss at this point. Im no expert on this one though."

    "selftext": "Been checking the returns at a local computer store the last couple of weeks and was thinking on going with the 9070 XT but never found one. Then all of the sudden an Inno3D 5070 Ti X3 turned up and with their loyalty program I got even more % off the return.\n\nSo I ordered and picked it up right away and swapped it for my Asus TUF 3090. And man did it do wonders for my temps. The old card idle around 50C with my 7800X3D something similar, but now the 5070 Ti idles at around 40C with the fans off and the CPU just above that. \n\nSo far it’s a decent upgrade, even for 4K gaming. At full load for a while it doesn’t go over 70C which is like 15 less than my 3090. So yeah, it was a solid upgrade. Especially since I got a good amount for the old card so in the end the upgrade was only like €80! ",

      "The 5070Ti is clearly better than the RTX 3090 for gaming. It performs better, it consumes less, and it has better DLSS technologies and performance. Also you will have more warranty for peace of mind. If you upgraded for only 80€ you clearly got a very good deal, congrats!",
      "Thanks!\n\nLove how everyone say the 3090 is better. They clearly haven’t done the jump or know what they   are talking about. They all think just because it has less VRAM it’s worse and what not.\n\nNow the upgrade isn’t as big as it would have been with a 5080 or 5090 of course but for almost no cost at all it was definitely worth it.",
      "Just efficiency alone is a big jump. The only downgrade is the memory bus width but the gddr7 makes up for most of it anyway. \n\nDon’t know why people think 3090 is faster than a 5070ti. \n\nRasterization wise it’s not as big as a jump for sure, but for $80 it’s a no brainer.",
      "I spent a minute downvoting them, if that helps. The 5070Ti blows away the 3090 for gaming. Even in scenarios where you'd need more than 16GB, the 3090 can't even do them. The RT capabilities aren't there when using that much memory and frame gen is non existent.\n\nWith DLSS quality and RT enabled (where Ada and Blackwell shine over Ampere) the 5070Ti can beat the 3090 by more than 40 percent, though not consistently.\n\nAnother major point? The new transformer model runs like dogwater on Ampere compared to Ada and Blackwell.",
      "Yes you would see a big bump in performance",
      "The 5070ti is a much better card than the 3090 for gaming",
      "At least you can sell your 3090 basically for the price of the 5070ti. The only benefit the 3090 has above the 5070ti is basically more vram",
      "It just shows some users of this sub can't read review benchmarks. It's a straight gain of 25% raw FPS, with less wattage. \n\nDepending on the used value of this 3090 and the price he got that new card, it can be a good move economically speaking.",

So it has nvlink / sli scaling, some other for multi-gpu computation. Two 3090 are better than 3-4 5070 if there's a big AI neural network to train. But if AI network is small, then 5070 can be faster in AI too.\n\nBetter CUDA compressible memory on L2 cache -> L2 is like even bigger for compressible data but only if developer enables this.\n\nTo simulate planets, stars in CUDA efficiently, each CUDA core needs to be occupied by calculations. To fully occupy 3090, it requires at least 160000 threads. But to fully occupy 5070, only 90000 threads required. So when PHYSX workload has 90000 particles, 5070 starts the battle 1 - 0.

It was crazy, games were only playable with noise cancelling headphones.\n\n\nI followed this video (https://youtu.be/G3260LR2JzQ) to replace the pads, used the thermalright pads recommended and just some standard MX-4 to re-paste the GPU. I was surprised at how sloppy the application of the factory pads were...took my time, cleaned all the surfaces with alcohol.\n\n\nNow it runs like a dream, fan is super quiet, temps don't get much over 80 on high load, even \"memory intensive applications\" (mining) it can keep temps under control at 60% fan speed.\n\n\nCan't recommend this mod enough if you have the tools and patience.

A plate sits on the GPU chip which is where you would apply thermal paste that helps make contact between the chip and heatsink.

I am pretty confident you are using a corsair case. Is it the 680X or 280X? Planning to build in the 680X myself though post the GN review of the case I am also going to put ll120's on the bottom as I see you have done. Has that improved thermals compared to in Steve's review of the case (assuming it is a 680X)? I also have to say I am a little annoyed that while corsair provides LL120's in the case, I have to buy more. Becasue despite having a white and a black version of the case. They only include black LL120's in the white case. Baffling move IMHO on corsairs part.",

So you take a 3090 and have the same design on TSMC 5nm, you could probably get a 50-60% performance uplift from that alone. Do keep in mind that Samsung's 8nm process is an improved 10nm process.\n\nNow take into account allowing for increase density, so more transistors can be added, thus more cores and thus more GPU performance.",

      "[Look at this measured RPM](https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Teaser.jpg) lmao\n\nFan 1 is trying to create a black hole",
      "So from what I can tell, the whole \"New World blowing up thing\" was basically a design flaw by EVGA (aka the Fan controller).\n\nAs for other GPUs apparently also blowing up, it is a consequence of hardware limitation (be it AMD or Nvidia) when your GPU going to extreme level of FPS (>1000) and no hardware/software monitor can keep up with what is sub 1ms spikes in voltages / power. Hence the GPU might experience issues.",
      "Starting after driver 456.98 hotfix, a bug appeared in the driver (which may or may not be related to some sort of inner design issue) on ALL cards (3080 and 3090 at that time), where a power limit: thermal flag would be incorrectly triggered.  It was determined by someone on [overclock.net](https://overclock.net) that this flag would ONLY randomly occur during a GPU load change of some sort.  This bug STILL exists on the latest Nvidia drivers.\n\nOn non eVGA cards, this would cause the power limit:thermal flag to be set.  This could be seen in GPU-Z as a single \"Magenta\" blip, which if you hovered over it, would show \"thermal\".\n\nHowever on eVGA cards, you would see the actual temperature that is causing this thermal flag directly on the ICX sensors.  It would show up on any of them randomly, with a temperature reading between 105C to 6500C.  There were multiple screenshots of this posted over in the eVGA forums in the 3090 FTW3 mega long bios thread.\n\nThis bug started with the VERY FIRST 457.xx driver branch.  Driver 456.98 hotfix was NOT affected by this bug.  I noticed this very instantly on my 3090 FE when I first saw the 457.xx driver release and tested a beta version and then the game ready version.  It bugged me to see it (although I noticed no actual throttling or performance issues when it happened)  but went back to 456.98 hotfix anyway.\n\nOne way I noticed to see the issue was to run Heaven Benchmark for a few loops then expand the GPU-Z power limit area.  Heaven has a ton of frame hitches on all cards (both AMD and Nvidia) in the exact same areas, so it's easier to see this here.  Another way to see it is after you close the Heaven benchmark and watch the card cool down.  But this requires that you have \"prefer maximum performance\" (note: this requires a reboot in order to actually take effect when changed) set enabled in the Nvidia drivers, so the card does NOT downclock back to 210 mhz!  That way, the card will still be running at full speed and the V/F curve and GPU core clocks will keep adjusting as the card cools down.  This is enough to trigger the \"thermal\" flag randomly sometimes.\n\nI absolutely DO NOT know whether the fan 1 speed overspeed report on eVGA cards is related to this, triggers because of this, or a completely different issue!  I am not seeing a thermal flag on Igor's gpu-z screenshots when this happens, but some people in the eVGA thread said that their fan ramped up to 100% speed very momentarily (when fan control was on automatic) when the very high VRM temp blips occurred, which is what you would expect.  But not a 50,000 RPM report....\n\nI at the time (late last year and very early this year) suggested that perhaps the eVGA cards randomly dying (usually in older games like League of Legends, Halo: MCC, GTA5 and Final Fantasy 14), was somehow related to this VRM overtemp reporting bug somehow.  However, a few users on the eVGA forums said their cards black screened in League / Halo MCC, even when they were using 456.98 hotfix or the Game Ready 456.xx driver before it (where there were no VRM overtemp reporting issues occurring), and I have no idea if the fan overspeed issue was happening or not.  So again, it could be two flaws happening here, with one affecting all 3080/3090 cards , regardless of AIB, but not killing hardware (Extreme overtemp blips causing Thermal flags), and a second specifically related to eVGA's controllers.\n\nSo again, I have absolutely no idea whether the >456.98 hotfix VRM temp bug (affects all cards) and eVGA issue are related or not.  (456.98 and older were not affected by the temp bug at least).  You can't use such old drivers on some games anyway (some may complain, some may not).   For Honor, for example, wouldn't even load on any Ampere driver before 456.98 hotfix (which was one of the reasons for the hotfix to begin with).",
      "Jesus Christ.\n\nIs EVGA going to update and distribute a BIOS to fix this ? Or is it impossible to fix with a BIOS update?",

      "I am seriously getting annoyed with EVGA....\n\nMy 1080 GTX was part of those cards that black screened and went to jet level fan speed. EVGA was dismissing it for ages until those hot spot images started coming out. Then they finally admitted that a batch of components on the cards were out of spec causing the safety to trip early. That whole stupid thermal pad crap replacement kit they did before that was also probably bullshit just to have to avoid to actually start fixing the faulty cards.",
      "Wait, I may just be misinformed but, why couldn’t they fix this through a BIOS/GPU update? Couldn’t they just force a maximum speed limit on the fans?",
      "Well better not touch any new releases because it ain't the game's fault",

      "So glad that Jay's nonsensical Tweet is front and center in this article. He was a huge catalyst in spreading the capacitor misinformation during the 3000 series launch, and here he is again getting caught with his foot directly in his mouth.\n\nI am an EVGA 3090 FTW Ultra owner and really appreciated EVGA's proactiveness in creating the queue very early in the shortages, and I've always agreed with Jay that EVGA does right by consumers with their RMA process.\n\nHowever, Jay's video and Tweets about this whole thing where he completely blames Amazon and deliberately avoids placing any blame on EVGA feels SO much like clout-chasing/being an enormous shill. It's actually incredible and I'll never watch his videos again.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting.\n\nThe real question now is what is EVGA going to do for us owners whose cards haven't popped yet? It's only a matter of time. I think the only thing that has saved me is that I have a GSYNC monitor (stopping old games from driving the framerate into the thousands), which is incredibly fortunate because I have played many hours of Halo MCC (which is one of the games that's been soliciting this behaviour from the cards).",
      "$4k GPU? Damn you get scalped or live in an expensive country?",
      "so happy this is finally getting the attention it deserves. I love EVGA but... had 3x3090 ftw3 ultra break. Weeks of downtime and being told by EVGA it must be something else. If the card breaks again they may not honor it. Sold the last RMA I got back and switched to a kingpin.  3 months later and still no issues.\n\nPeople in the EVGA forums were blaming games like gta5 a few months back also. I have 8 pages of registered cards with EVGA(i like them). This gen their high end is anything but.",
      "Their 1080 GTXs weren't that particularly good either with the thermal issues as well as the black screen + jet fans hardware issue.",
      "Simplest solution to this is to go to your global GPU settings and limit the framerate to the refreshrate of your monitor."

      "Yeah it's absolutely shocking that they were allowed to leave the factory with the memory temps that high, especially with the pads not even fully contacting the chips which I'm not the first to show.\n\nIt's ironic as graphics cards in the past have been infamous for having bad thermal paste rather than pads but this time around the paste was actually really good and the pads were utter crap.",
      "Yeah I agree, if I'm paying £1,400 for a graphics card then I bloody well expect it to have the best thermal pads and paste they can use, especially for being able to get it in bulk most likely.\n\nI genuinely thought I'd maybe have to replace the paste and pads in two years or so, I've had the card for two months and only found out about this around two weeks ago so had been obliviously damaging my card every time I played a game or rendered with it before that, which thankfully wasn't too often, but still happened when it shouldn't have.",
      "Just repadded my 3090FE as well and I'm seeing the same exact results. Improved memory junction and core temperatures across the board.\n\nI noticed high refresh rates games like Sea of Thieves made the memory far too toasty for my comfort and I consistently measured 100c+ during extended periods of gameplay. With the repad, the highest memory junction temp I've observed is 82c which is a nearly 20c improvement. I'd say I've even lost about 3-5c off my core temps as well using Thermalright TFX.\n\nI strongly suspect that in 1-2 years we're going to see 3000 series cards start to fail due to the excessive memory temperatures especially on the FE cards (though the vram temp issue even plagues 3rd party cards). Nvidia customer service claiming 100c memory temps was within spec brought me zero comfort.",
      "It's insane these cards have been sold like this.",
      "I finally worked up the courage to take apart my 3090, as I was getting ridiculous memory junction temperatures. The highest I saw on the stock fan setting was 112 degrees, which is crazy and only one other post about this showed the temps that high.\n\nI don't mine, but I followed this guide here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3260LR2JzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3260LR2JzQ) as it was the best one and I really made sure to take my time. Overall, it was about five hours, as I wanted to make sure I'd not need to take the card apart again. I used simple masking tape to lift off the little screw covers and tape back the fan and LED cables. Don't use anything stickier, as you could end up tearing the cables.\n\nI did use the Thermalright pads at 1.5mm as recommended in the video, but instead of using the TF8 or TFX thermal paste, I used Arctic's new MX-5 which, seems to have worked brilliantly as I'm getting 5 degrees lower temps on the core when at full load gaming and rendering. I suppose this could also be to do with the memory now being a lot cooler, but it's still good to know you don't have to buy the pastes seemingly impossible to find in larger than 2g tubes.\n\nI didn't buy one of these, as many had commented about how they ended up with a dried out tube, so as I had bought MX-5 to repaste my Xbox One X, I thought I'd use it here too. Another user mentioned they used MX-4 and their core temps were no different than before, which is good as the stock paste this time around is great, ironically.\n\nThis also turned out to be a good call, as I ended up having to wipe off the paste twice due to mistakes, and hairs getting stuck in it.\n\nAs for the memory temps, I now see it max out jumping between 82 and 84 degrees, so that's damn near a 30 degree drop in temps for the memory, so I'd highly recommend doing this.\n\nI've also taken the SLI connector cover off, there was a user who mentioned this being off allowed the backplate to sit a bit better and thus cool better. It gets trapped a bit by the backplate which explains why the cover is so damn hard to get off when you first get the card.",
      "Nope that is not the case at all, I don't mine, I'm a 3D artist and I occasionally game.\n\nRendering was causing these high temps and while 112 degrees was the highest I saw with the stock fan curve I have it on video that it was getting to 106 degrees with a render running right behind the HWiNFO window which is how I monitored it, this was after I'd made an aggressive custom fan curve in MSI afterburner.",
      "Nah. Unless you have been mining Ethereum then your memory temps have most likely been fine.",
      "On which statistics is this based off? So far gddr6x is new no one got it 2 years and nvidia itself says via customersupport 95-110 is considered normal temp and the chip makers say up to 115c.\n\nSo yeah...\n\nThe new ryzen 5000 series is also hotter but considered normal. ( temps of around 80-90c is normal but considered vs older ryzen way too hot)\n\nAlso tons of memory based products like m2 also got a working temp like too cold or too hot = lower life span / performance and I don't speak about like below zero temperatures more like 20-30c off.",

      "115c is max spec.",
      "Indeed, it's troubling to find they think it's perfectly acceptable for the chips to be running hotter than the manufacturer themselves specify, they need to address this.\n\nDid you use the 1.5mm pads all around? I'm seeing a slight bow up of the backplate which makes think the memory chips are actually a bit too high up for 1.5mm and the stock pads looking to be 1mm makes me think this even more.\n\nI might try taking the backplate off again and rolling the thermal pads a bit flatter to see if that helps, I'm concerned some of the other components could potentially not be getting the contact they need if the memory pads are keeping the backplate up too high.",

No TCC mode drivers and gimped fp16, fp64 performance etc.\n\nStill good enough for most use cases though naturally, with the added bonus of being faster than a 3080 for those of us that game on the side.",
      "Ampere is pushed far past its optimal efficiency point on the perf/w curve to squeeze out every last bit of performance and compete with AMD. That's why it's pretty easy to drop a good amount of power consumption and still get almost all of the performance. Every GPU manufacturer does this.",
      "Yea scalpers",
      "> What is the fucking point?\n\nCan tell you, but doubt you'll like the answer.\n\nNvidia is constrained on chips.  Not just the core GPU chip, but memory chips and all the other chips needed to built a finished GPU card.  Some of these are used across the product lines.  They make more money on the more expensive cards, so they prioritize those.  Given that the market is clearly prepared to pay extremely high prices, they're making an even higher priced, higher margin, higher revenue version of their existing highest end product.\n\nAdditionally, the 3090 and 3080 use the same exact GPU chip from the same exact wafers.  After production, each chip is tested.  Initially, only a minority of chips likely qualified for use in a 3090.  But over time, chip yields improve as the process is perfected.  By now, it's possible that a majority of the chips coming off the 3080/3090 wafers qualify for use in a 3090.\n\nNvidia makes *far* more revenue on a 3090 than a 3080, and will make *even more* revenue from a 3090 Super.\n\nTLDR - Nvidia have a limited supply of everything.  They make far greater margins on the highest end, most expensive products.  They have been prioritizing the highest priced, highest margin products for the last year.  Now, they seem to be planning an even more expensive product to increase margins further.  \n\nAnd yes, it will cut into the supply of the lower priced products."

Each eye is an independent scene with no temporal dependencies on the other eye, so running SLI in SFR mode could have resulted in practically perfect scaling with barely any effort on the dev's part.\n\nNvidia even had an SDK prepared to implement SLI in VR games. It just had incredibly low adoption and never became the savior of SLI like it could have been.\n\nIf it had seen widespread adoption, we could even be seeing titles like Microsoft Flight Simulator VR running at a full 90fps with no reprojection with something like a 3090ti SLI setup. As of now, unfortunately, even the best gaming computer in the world will only do 45fps with reprojection.",

Jay already released a video saying, \"EVGA sold more cards that's why EVGA shows up, it's the game's fault\". That my friend, is how you weaponize media.

I'm busy trying to get other content lined-up right now. I didn't have time to dump my entire schedule for something that had no data or research behind it on a moment's notice.\n\nBTW, we're a large part of the reason iCX exists -- we're the ones who covered the ACX thermals in the depth that caused early pressure for EVGA to fix it.

It's not that demand was so high that you couldn't get a card, it's that **EVGA didn't ship anything to the EU** _at all_ for weeks (possibly months) and didn't communicate with retailers about it. Then when they did start shipping, just didn't ship any kind of quantities. \n\nThis meant that those who pre-ordered an EVGA card had zero chance of actually getting one compared to pre-ordering a different manufacturer's card. It was a shitty way for EVGA to handle it, all they had to do was communicate that EU shipments would come later.\n\nEDIT: I love that this is getting downvotes, almost certainly from US folks that thinks we're just making shit up. Take a look at EVGA's own megathread on it: https://forums.evga.com/What39s-going-on-with-EU-and-308039s-m3109033.aspx There are people on there who waited **10 months** to get their card after ordering on release day.",

You dont even need to pretend you never put a block on it they dont care as long as it returns with stock cooler. I mean if they ask if its overclocked just say no and act like you dont even understand what it is. Kind of like the xmp and intel warranty stuff. If you said what’s xmp they stopped asking questions. I would be really surprised if evga pulled some crap like that tbh. They are one of the few consumer friendly board partners left in my books.

It's in his twitter bio. Plus, that drama pays the bills for him so I can't blame him. \n\nIn terms of US though, if EVGA has more cards in the market, they are going to have more *failed* cards.

I mentioned this on the EVGA forum and was told it was perfectly normal which is garbage because other premium AIBs are a lot cooler and quieter. The PCB is very flimsy and flexible, and they use garbage thermal putty instead of pads. While this is still objectively an awesome card and a great performer, EVGA definitely dropped off in quality this cycle and I don't doubt they cut corners on the components of the card as well.",

      "So, as an Electronics Engineer and PCB Designer I feel I have to react here.\n\nThe point that Igor makes about improper power design causing instability is a very plausible one. Especially with first production runs where it indeed could be the case that they did not have the time/equipment/driver etc to do proper design verification.\n\nHowever, concluding from this that a POSCAP = bad and MLCC = good is waaay to harsh and a conclusion you cannot make.\n\nBoth POSCAPS (or any other 'solid polymer caps' and MLCC's have there own characteristics and use cases.\n\nSome (not all) are ('+' = pos, '-' = neg):\n\n**MLCC:**\n\n\\+ cheap\n\n\\+ small\n\n\\+ high voltage rating in small package\n\n\\+ high current rating\n\n\\+ high temperature rating\n\n\\+ high capacitance in small package\n\n\\+ good at high frequencies\n\n\\- prone to cracking\n\n\\- prone to piezo effect\n\n\\- bad temperature characteristics\n\n\\- DC bias (capacitance changes a lot under different voltages)\n\n**POSCAP:**\n\n\\- more expensive\n\n\\- bigger\n\n\\- lower voltage rating\n\n\\+ high current rating\n\n\\+ high temperature rating\n\n\\- less good at high frequencies\n\n\\+ mechanically very strong (no MLCC cracking)\n\n\\+ not prone to piezo effect\n\n\\+ very stable over temperature\n\n\\+ no DC bias (capacitance very stable at different voltages)\n\nAs you can see, both have there strengths and weaknesses and one is not particularly better or worse then the other. It all depends.\n\nIn this case, most of these 3080 and 3090 boards may use the same GPU (with its requirements) but they also have very different power circuits driving the chips on the cards.\n\nEach power solution has its own characteristics and behavior and thus its own requirements in terms of capacitors used.\n\nThus, you cannot simply say: I want the card with only MLCC's because that is a good design.\n\nIt is far more likely they just could/would not have enough time and/or resources to properly verify their designs and thus where not able to do proper adjustments to their initial component choices.\n\nThis will very likely work itself out in time. For now, just buy the card that you like and if it fails, simply claim warranty. Let them fix the problem and down draw to many conclusions based on incomplete information and (educated) guess work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: it seems EVGA basically confirmed this by saying: \" But, due to the time crunch, some of the reviewers were sent a pre-production version with 6 POSCAP’s, we are working with those reviewers directly to replace their boards with production versions.EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 XC3 series with 5 POSCAPs + 10 MLCC solution is matched with the XC3 spec without issues. \"\n\nEdit 2: Also, this could be the reason Asus is 'late' whith there cards\n\nEdit 3: it seems Gigabyte uses non-MLCC parts but does not have problems, confirming the point you cant simply judge based on capacitor type and count.\n\nEdit 4: now that JayzTwoCents has done a video about it it all goes wild in [that thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/izrexc/the_rtx_3080_launch_cant_get_any_worse_right_wrong/g6n834z?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) as well",

    "selftext": "Pretty much as the title states.\n\n  \n\n\nBeen playing New world since launch now, and was getting black-screen GPU driver crashes almost every day, a few days ago after a black screen my system wouldn't boot.\n\n  \n\n\nRe-seated my 3090 and all was well again, but to be safe I was running it completely bone-stock.\n\n  \n\n\nWas okay yesterday, but then today another black-screen crash, so I power down the system, and now it won't power up at all, PSU just makes a clicking sound and RAM RGB turns on, but no system fans spin up and no mobo lights come on.\n\n  \n\n\nRe-seat the 3090...same thing, pull the 3090 and the system powers up just fine but with no display(no igpu) so I go grab my 2080Ti from my server and pop it in, system back to running fine.\n\n  \n\n\nI really thought I would have dodged this issue as my 3090 was from over 3months post launch, but here I am.\n\n  \n\n\nI know this is a relatively narrow but well understood issue, but man is it frustrating. My 2080Ti had a fan die, and now the replacement 2080Ti had it's HDMI port die in only a few months, I had my 1300w EVGA PSU exploded after only 3 weeks of owning it, and now my 3090 has died 2 days before the start of the BF2042 beta.\n___________\n\nEdit: this is a reason I keep buying EVGA though. Tech support ticket responded with RMA allowance within 4 hours, RMA now submitted. \n\nEVGA actually has an option for \"New World Game\" now in the drop down list of reasons for the RMA, this problem must be far-far more widespread than only \"a few dozen cases\"\n\n\n\n_____________\nEdit: Day 2\n\nHow about this for luck my friends?\n\n_____________\n\nAfter my 3090 Died in New world I switched out to a 2080Ti that I never sold and was all back up and running.\n\n(I should preface by saying that the HDMI port on this 2080Ti died 5 weeks ago, so I have no idea if it was already dying and just wasn't being stressed at all to finish it off.)\n\nSo I played New World a bit on the 2080Ti (I know a whole lot of you will claim that was crazy, and maybe it was but I cannot say, and there are no widespread reports of issues on 2 series) Anyway, played a bit, had no issues at all aside from reduced performance compared to the 3090. Stop playing, use the computer like normal for a few hours, browsing reddit, listening to music.\n\nShut down the PC like normal for the night, no issues. This morning, go to power on the PC and my Video signal dies 30seconds into booting, go to BIOS and still video loss in 30 seconds.\n\nI try everything, reseating everything in my Computer and nothing, at this point not getting any video signal at all.\n\nI give up and swap to my little bitty Quadro I have for my up and coming NAS, and system boots fine and here I am.\n\nSo, $3,300 in GPU dead in sub 24Hour use.\n\nI will now take a bow and accept all the flames from everyone who's about to call me a psycho for playing New World some more, in what should have been 100% safe.",

      "Its not even limited to new world, there's been an ongoing thread on the EVGA forums about this since launch. My first and replacement FTW3 3090s both died long before new world came out.",
      "To everyone swearing up and down that the game bricks cards, someone really explain how please. Because the game making defective cards fail has a solid explanation. The game making perfectly good cards fail seems unlikely.\n\nAll things considered, of the hundreds of thousands of people that played at launch, how many of those with 3080s or 3090s had their cards brick? If it's multiple manufacturers, is it possible quality control of the components they manufactured the cards with was shoddy at best during covid, so now we're seeing more defective units shipped during peak covid times?\n\nI had a 1070 brick on monster hunter world. People's GPUs brick all the time on lots of things. Maybe the failure rate is higher now because of the pandemic, who knows, but again if someone wants to explain how new world makes a good unit fail, I would like to know.",

      "Imagine that on a 1.5k-tier GPU.",
      "Exactly. Hardware, across multiple different variations that I know of (TUF Strix FTW3 etc.) have all been killed by new world, but no other game does this, not even insanely graphically intense games.",
      "same reason anybody overclocks.",
      "RMA already submitted. EVGA literally has a drop down option in the claim now for \"New World Game\"",

Also It doesnt make sense for them to raise the prices again with big navi and a new console gen this fall/early winter. Sure they can market that big navi cant compete with dlss + 3000 cards if they dont lower prices  (which i think is a major sticking point for me since amd doesnt have an answer for dlss2 yet) but like the past 2 gens havent really had any competition this one does and they know that. i do not think theyll have the astronomical prices like many people think.",

      "All of Jensen's benchmarks will be cherry picked and using DLSS 4. We won't know until reviewers get their hands on it.",
      "I've got a 3090 paired with a 12900k. I'm just gonna sit this generation out as the only real upgrade would be the 509,  and I'm not spending over 2k on a gpu.  Yeah I'm missing some of the 4000 series bells and whistles, but I'm still gaming at 4k with no issue.  Nvidia is going to have to pull my 24gb of vram from my cold dead hands (yes I know there's faster cards in the 4000 series).",
      "Exactly. As much as we are all bitching about rumors, we won't know price-to-performance of this gen until it comes from Jensen's mouth.",

      "Sometimes i feel like the people who chase the bleeding edge every gen care less about playing their games and more about the bragging rights of having the top end at all times.  \n\nNothing wrong with that, but it stops being about performance or fidelity after a point when you're working in 18 month upgrade cycles, and i'd rather spend that money chasing new monitor tech right now.  Just be honest and admit you like having the top end for itself.  I've done it in the past, nothing wrong with it if it makes you feel better.",

      "From Jensen mouth to tech Jesus’s test bench",
      "It's like RAM on your PC.\n\nIt's fine until you run out.  When you get close to running out your entire system slows the hell down as it has to pull assets from storage and then shuffle shit around RAM and has no idea how to optimize it from there, because normally RAM is just dumping it there and filling it up.\n\nSo VRAM is the same but for graphics.\n\nImagine VRAM/RAM being your kitchen table with prep as you cook food.  Your SSD/HDD is your fridge.\n\nMore VRAM means you can dump your entire fridge (SSD) onto your kitchen table (VRAM) and have it all accessible immediately.  However if you run out of room (VRAM max) you now have to shuffle shit around and go back and forth putting stuff in and out of the fridge.\n\nObviously this is really slow.\n\nSo for a GPU once VRAM is maxed out, your FPS becomes much less consistent and can be much slower by like 30-40%, worse as the demands get higher.  \n\nThe idea is that, you want your GPU to be outdated before you truly max out VRAM.  With current Nvidia GPUs, the GPUs they offer are MORE than capable of handling higher VRAM but will instead be choked to reducing settings simply because they don't have the room for it.",
      "Fellow 3090 owner here. I am personally waiting to see how second-hand 4090 prices will be affected once the 5090 has saturated that area of the market. This will probably be around 6-12 months after the 5090 releases. If I can get a 4090 for \\~$900 or less, I will probably go that route versus a 5080 Ti or 5090. Especially if the 5090 is going to be >$1800.",
      ">Chasing new monitor tech right now is a terrible idea. OLED is fast evolving and according to Mark from Blurbusters, who actually gets consulted by manufacturers and who gets to test samples, we'll have 1000hz OLED displays in the very near future. The current OLED monitors have terrible HDR in high ABL scenes compared to mid range TVs like the LG C series, and they also need to use display stream compression to reach their highest refresh rate (4k240hz or 1440p 480hz) at native resolution.\n\nI mean, it depends what you're upgrading from, and when i say i'd rather get new monitor tech, i mean that I personally would get more mileage out of spending the money there than on a new card atm.  \n\nThat said...the rumor of a 1000hz OLED really doesn't sway me.  neither does the compression necessity at 4k240 or 1440p480.  Like ok, those are limitations of the tech currently, but when am i ever going to take advantage of 1000 hz in the next 5 years?  What tech do we have that's going to drive 1000 stable FPS at 1080 or 1440p on the horizon, let alone at 4k?  Hell, reaching 240 at 4k native isn't a realistic situation either in the forseeable future.  top shelf benchmark setups were getting like 120 fps in modern titles at 4k with NO ray tracing.  The limitation of needing stream compression at 4k240 native res just isn't something i'm going to care about because we can't hit that performance threshold in the first place and we won't for quite some time.  \n\nIt's like saying \"Don't buy that new car, it's aerodynamically limited to 200 MPH, and future models are going to fix the aero to allow for 300 MPH.\" when the engine in the car can't get the the thing past 100 MPH even pushed to it's limits.  like sure, there's limitations with current monitor tech that might get blown away in the next few years, but they're not relavant to the VAST majority of usecases.\n\nLike be serious, a 1000 hz monitor is not something that matters in a world where you're breaking 150 FPS at 4k once in a blue moon on native res.\n\n>Buying a top of the line 4090/5090 compared to current top of the line monitors will give you a lot more value in terms of actual gaming and future resale it's not even close.\n\nCase by case basis, and again, it depends on what you're upgrading from.  I don't really care about a 30% FPS increase if i'm already maxing visuals in my games and hitting a stable high framerate, but i DO care about getting higher pixel density and better display tech over my current setup.\n\nalso, man, i am not sitting here reselling shit, that is such a pain in the ass.  yeah sure it's a part of the value proposition for some people, but not for me.  i just give stuff i upgrade from to friends.",
      "I'll try my shot at a 5080. If the bots and scalpers prevent me from getting one, then I'll take it as a sign.",
      "No",
      "Wait for benchmarks",
      "I have a 3090 and I’m confused as what people are doing with their computers at this point…. It can run basically every game at max settings passed 60fps at 4k. I suppose there are a few terribly unoptimized games that struggle but damn unless you have like a triple monitor playing multiple games at once what’s the point.\n\nRant over I would keep the high VRAM, seems to becoming more and more important for games."

Funny how he showed 0 proof though. \n\nFor reference Steve from GN pushed a 3090 kingpin to 2450mhz ~700w of power on liquid nitrogen. These chips scale frequency with temp, highest I've seen my kingpin get and hold through a 3dmark run is ~2150 and that is with a custom tuned NVVDD (GPU core1) ,  MSVDD (GPU core2) and tuned load line with core only hitting 49c because of the liquid cooling. All of these are impossible on a FE. \n\nSo I'm pressing X for doubt.",

      "No company is going to RMA a card that's working and not showing any problems.",
      "What to do if you're not willing to open up and change the pads yourself? Can you RMA the card before you notice any issues? My MSI 3080 is from like October 2020",
      "oh boy here we go again with the thermal pads...\n\nMy policy regarding this is just use your gpu, if it works, great, if it doesnt RMA it, but dont go out of your way to possibly void your warranty by replacing pads yourself. If a company skimps for few thermal pads let them know that its going to backfire by RMA'ing  that and dont risk it with our own money. If you replace thermal pads yourself you are not only enabling this type of behavior from manufacturers but you are also risking of losing your own money.",
      "Yes and no.\n\nEVGA offered to RMA their 1080 SC's (iirc) back in the day because they were found to have a weakness that caused them to blow under strain. \n\nSo anybody with that brand of card could get it RMA'd and switched over to the new version if they wanted.",
      "Why are you getting downvoted ?  They don’t have a mining farm it’s just a single 3080 it’s the same as any other person that owns a 3080 they just use it for mining",
      "Zotac specifically made a statement saying that, if you open the stock fan shroud, *for any reason*, you've effectively voided the warranty. A bunch of people in the Zotac sub got mad, a rep came out and said they were going to basically think about it, and I haven't seen anything since.",
      "Yea when you buy a GPU you shouldn’t have to pop it open and replace shit anyway. Also most GPUs come with a decent warranty (3 to sometimes even 4 years if you register the card early enough). So if you have problems or temps drastically increase down the road, just RMA while it’s under warranty",
      "[redacted]",
      "I have been saying these in the past, just change the thermal pads regardless of which manufacturer for 3080/3090 ! Mine was a Zotac 3080 Amp Holo and I drop my VRAM temp by 18 degrees when I changed my thermal pads to Thermalright Odessey thermal pads..\n\nGDDR6X is unbearably hot, my brother's Gigabyte 3080 Vision OC doesn't even have thermal pad on the backplate, performing even worse than mine at stock",
      "Any one with a 3080FE? Hows your temps looking?",
      "Sure, but there's 0 actual enforcement of it. You'd have to sue them to prove your point. Companies take the safe bet that the vast majority of people won't bother.",
      "I think most gamers should do the same. I got my 3090 to game, but mining eth in between gaming sessions has paid for the card. I didn't buy it for mining but why not pay for the card.",
      "I replaced all the thermal pads on the front and back of my Gigabyte Aorus 3080 Xtreme, I had to use 4 different thicknesses to do it perfectly. All in all, it dropped the mem temps 28c while gaming and 40c+ while mining eth.\n\nI say 40c+ for mining because at 100MH/s it would instantly hit 110c, so I had to massively underclock to keep the temps safe. After changing the pads my temps were 70c, but as it throttled at 110c, there's no way to tell how high it would have actually gone.",
      "No issues after strapping an extra fan to it.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/photos/shared/oktmaUFpTf23xtN5dx3jwQ.sTQdi38EdRHTFSrkr30-ZI",
      "This is Celsius. Water boils at 100C, junction max temperature is usually between 100C and 115C. After that the silicon breaks down and the product can die.\n\nSensors don't often read the absolute hottest temperatures, and if they are external they could be reading Tcase, there is often a 10-20C increase going from Tcase to Tjunction. And like I said, when juction is that hot bad things can happen.",
      "Micron actually adjusted GDDR6x spec several months after cards launched from 105c to 110c. So take that 110c number with a grain of salt.",
      "yeah i only understand this mod when your gpu is going to lose warranty period soon, then yeah. Repaste your gpu, blow out the dust and possibly replace thermal pads, but for brand new gpu? nahh",
      "A card they also game with as well, at that.",
      "To be fair to them, full production provides much more data than anything they could do in house.   \nOn the flip side, there could've been pressure from other manufacturers to alter the published specs to reduce concerns, so without access to data we can't really say for sure either way...",
      "That's why you get it from MSI USA in California."

Couple that with a slowing economy and less discretionary income, plus an enormous stockpile of discounted previous gen cards means that far fewer people are \"desperate\" to buy the 4000 series. \n\nI just don't see people being willing to spend $2500+ on a scalped 4090 like they were with 3090s a few years ago.",

Each GPU can contain hundreds to thousands of CUDA cores. Architecture changes in a fashion that makes cross-generation comparisons often non-linear, but generally speaking (within a generation), more CUDA cores will equate more raw compute power from the GPU. The Kepler to Maxwell architecture jump saw nearly a 40% efficiency gain in CUDA core processing ability, illustrating the difficulty of linearly drawing comparisons without proper benchmarks.\n\nCUDA Cores are parallel processors, just like your CPU might be a dual- or quad-core device, nVidia GPUs host several hundred or thousand cores. The cores are responsible for processing all the data that is fed into and out of the GPU, performing game graphics calculations that are resolved visually to the end-user. An example of something a CUDA core might do would include rendering scenery in-game, drawing character models, or resolving complex lighting and shading within an environment.”\n\nFrom https://www.gamersnexus.net/dictionary/2-cuda-cores\n\nSo, CUDA cores are kind of important for gaming among other things.",

It's how the likes of Sony and Microsoft are selling literally \\*record\\* amounts of consoles - cuz as console launches, they had their ducks in a row way, way ahead of time.\n\nThat's really what it comes down to.  TSMC is lights out, working at maximum capacity.  But there's so much demand, it's all about who has got their orders in(and how much they were willing to pay for that supply of course).\n\nI think going with Samsung allowed Nvidia to save money(that \\*maybe\\* got passed onto us), but they could have totally went with TSMC if they wanted to, assuming they got their orders in early enough.\n\nThis is why Nvidia, many months ago, already secured large 5nm capacity for next year.",

      "garbage site....well known.... try Gamers Nexus or Hardware unboxed or Daniel Owen if you want real comparisons",
      "I just went from a 3080 to a 5070 Ti. Originally, I was looking for a used 4090, as 5090s are selling for 3,7k usd where I live. However, used 4090s are selling for about 2,4k usd, which is twice as much as the 5070 Ti, and I just fail to find ways to justify paying this much for a 2 year-old used GPU.\n\nMy original alternative for the 4090 was the 5080. This is why I ended up going for the 5070 Ti instead:\n\n*The performance difference is not worth the price difference for me; about 37% more expensive for 14% more performance (4K RT average according to TPU).\n\n*Both the 5080 and 5070 Ti are limited by the same 16GB RAM. As was the case with my 3080 10GB (the card ran out of VRAM before its chip was obsolete), those cards will run out of VRAM before their chips become obsolete. What I mean by this is that, by the time the 5070 Ti becomes obsolete because 16GB is not enough, the 5080 will suffer the same issue. Any game that will run on a 5080 will run almost as good on a 5070 Ti, as the performance difference between them both is not big enough to give them a generational gap (like the 4090 over the 4080, or the 5090 over the 5080). In other words, by the time the 5070 Ti becomes obsolete, so will the 5080.\n\n*I was really fortunate with 5070 Ti AIB SKU market timing and managed to buy a top-end SKU (Palit Gamerock) for the same price as an entry-level Asus/Gigabyte/MSI SKU. In other words, I got an AIB with top-tier cooling performance for the price of an entry-level SKU. I found no such deal with the 5080 cards.\n\nIf the 5080 had 20GB (or more), then this would be an entirely different story. But, at 16GB, the 5070 Ti just felt like a better deal for me.",
      "I upgraded from a 3090 to a 5080. The 3090 just wasn't cutting it anymore for 4k gaming with path/ray tracing in AW2 and Indiana Jones. Being able to use MFG is a game changer and the 5080 is an overclocking beast.",
      "It runs pretty close to a regular 5070 just 24GB VRAM. It’s definitely not in the realm of “barely hold its own” but it’s not gonna run 4k like a 5080 if you have an extra $1450 just laying around. I’ve never been able to spend more than like $700 because I sit on my PC like maybe one or two times a week and can’t justify really even that.. so if you can sell it for a chunk I guess why not but the 3090ti is definitely still a decent GPU",
      "They go for closer to $1000 on ebay",
      "You can sell it for 1k or so best time to dump it is probably now",
      "That's probably because of the GDDR7 memory which is faster, doesn't need to cache as much, hence, more efficient. If these cards had a wider Bus they'd be even better. The 5090 is probably the only card that officially is a \"Great\" card, apart from melting ofcourse.",

We all talked about how great PC was until the masses joined us and now they brought their nonsense with them. \n\nThat's true but if you have an Asus motherboard and want to get a GPU, and give a shit about what colour the RGBs are, would you buy a Gigabyte GPU and install another app? Or would you get an Asus and use whatever the fuck they call their software?\n\nSame goes for Corsair, if you have a Corsair AIO for your CPU and (for some god forsaken reason) you're looking at getting some RGB memory... it all serves to create that little bit of friction should you mix their hardware with a competitors.\n\nLosing that is certainly part of the problem, the second part is that none of these companies are software development companies. They likely don't have particularly large or competent dev teams and certainly won't have anyone qualified enough to do meaningful demand validation for features.\n\nIt's why we get crap like NZXT cramming overclocking tools, overlays and PC monitoring into the flaming shitheap that is CAM. Their devs probably suggested the features because they're easy to cram in, they may even have asked a few users via questionnaires who said it would be great (users always fucking say this), and once it's in there, no matter how unpopular the software becomes, stripping it out becomes an admission of error and renders the work on it futile.\n\nConvincing companies to strip features *out* of a program, let alone work with competitors, is an impossibility and we've just gone too far in terms of them all investing in Cue, CAM and all that shit for them to stop now.",

Take a look at [RT section of Techpowerup 3090Ti review](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-founders-edition/34.html), where it's 1.29x faster than a 3080 10GB at 4K, 1.265x at 1440p, 1.24x at 1080p. That game in particular is very close to 100% GPU bound with this setup even at 1080p, so it shouldn't be a factor here.",
      "If this game can tax even the current top end gaming GPU, then IMO it's still a valid benchmark and will be for the upcoming GPUs as well. A modern day Crysis if you want. Of course it can't be conclusive having just one game, but that's how pre-release marketing works.\n\n2000 series is kind of a proof of concept for raytracing, 3000 took the same thing and made it viable for practical use. Maybe the performance uplift in 4000 is only that significant with RT on, because 3000 still takes a hit from that.",

      "A 3090 Ti for the same price as a 4080 would be pretty dumb. The 4080 is still 20% faster and a generation newer (more efficient, features). The 3090 Ti needs to be \\~20-25% cheaper than the 4080 to make sense.",

With how cut-down and die size-anaemic the Lovelace cards look to be, I wouldn't be surprised if they do another Super refresh like that.",
      "They're going to sell out. The Sheep will buy them.  They are impulsive and they want better performance now regardless of the cost. Nvidia is playing the supply restraint game to get people to pay more and people are falling for it.",
