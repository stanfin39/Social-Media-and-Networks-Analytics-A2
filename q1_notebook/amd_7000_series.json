    "title": "Looking to buy a 7600 XT.",
    "selftext": "My current video card is a 1060 6GB running with a Ryzen 5600X3D (I got a great bundle deal at Microcenter).\n\nIt is a hand me down card that I have been running for about 6 months.  It does surprisingly well for the games that I play.  I'm not unhappy with it and I'm happy to have something that runs well with some settings turned down.  What I really don't love is that it sounds like a jet engine with almost any game running.  I did have some thermal paste that I re-applied to it, which helped a little, but it is just so loud still.\n\nMy previous card was a 5600xt that I bought to finally replace my workhorse - the 760 GTX.  I only used the 5600 for a short bit, though, as I built a budget system for my son but couldn't afford a decent video card (this was during \\~2020-21).  I installed my 5600xt in the system I gave him and I went back to the 760.  The 1060 was handed down from a friend.  All this to say that I have gotten used to lower settings :)\n\nI recently started looking at an upgrade and thought that the 7700xt looked like what I wanted - until I saw that the prices were pretty solid at $429+.  The 7600xt was my next choice.  I didn't love it at $329 but I have a gift card to microcenter to take it down to $280.  With tax that would be \\~$304.  Then I saw one that was open box for $280, which would be \\~$250 out the door.  I feel like that is a price I can afford and not a bad price for a 7600xt.  The cheapest out the door for a 7700xt would be \\~$412.  That's not something I can do right now.\n\nI have a 1080p monitor and have no plans to upgrade that in the near future.  I'm really just looking for constructive thoughts on whether I should move on the open box 7600xt or just hang onto the 1060 for now and see what else comes along.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\nedit:  Adding my \"out the door\" cost for different cards at Microcenter.  I added more thoughts to a comment below but I'm thinking that the 7600xt open box is my best option.  If not for that it would probably be the 7600 with some thought on the 4060.  I'm also thinking that I might keep watching and see if the 7700xt comes down at all - or maybe I find an open box to bring it down a bit.  Although maybe that is just overkill for what I use it for.\n\nAlso added the 6750xt.  I need to look into that one more.\n\n4060\t          $273.39\n\n4060ti\t          $370.41\n\n4070\t          $542.89\n\n7600\t          $241.05\n\n7600xt\t          $305.73\n\n7600xt ob        $252.87\n\n7700xt\t\t  $435.09\n\n6750xt             $348.85\n\n&#x200B;",

      "At 1080p you aren't up against the 16GB VRAM wall, not even close, might as well just get a vanilla 7600 or if you want DLSS etc a 4060 which would be probably $30-40 USD more but still should be cheaper than a 7600XT.",
      "I didn't consider this but I am looking into it more now.\n\nI can't get a 6700xt at MC but I can get a 6750XT for $348.  \n\nThat card looks like it falls in between the 7600xt and 7700xt and close to the 4060ti.\n\nThanks!",
      "6700 xt.",
      "Don't. The 7600 XT is not worth the money. You'd be better off with a 6700 XT.",
      "Thanks for your thoughts!\n\nI'm seeing that the memory bandwidth is the same on the 4060 as the 7600xt.  One review showed the cards being very close, swapping the 1 and 2 spot from game to game, but that the few VRAM heavy games showed a double digit advantage to the 7600xt.\n\nI'm leaning towards more VRAM, not for any need to feel cutting edge but from my history of modding Skyrim :)  It was always one of the key metrics to consider.\n\nStill, I put a list together of what I could buy at Microcenter today.\n\nIf the open box 7600xt were not available I would be looking solidly at the 7600 for $241 - and I'd have to give some thought to the 4060 at $273.  The 7600xt is $60 more at $305 and, other than the extra VRAM, doesn't seem like much of an improvement.\n\nIf the 7600xt open box works out, at $252 it seems like the best option for me.\n\n4060\t          $273.39\n\n4060ti\t          $370.41\n\n4070\t          $542.89\n\n7600\t          $241.05\n\n7600xt\t          $305.73\n\n7600xt ob        $252.87\n\n7700xt\t\t  $435.09",
      "Thanks for the feedback!\nI'm getting set on the 6750xt",
      "$250 for 7600XT is a decent deal for sure.",
      "Yeah, I'm leaning this route.  \nThe 6700xt would probably be my choice but it is completely not available through MC.\n\nThe 6750 is $100 more than I was planning but it really seems like a better future proof card compared to the 7600xt.  The open box price is the only thing that makes the 7600xt more desirable.  Without that it is $50 more for a lot better performance. But a slower memory bus (although the 4060ti is right there with the 6750 - slower bus and all)",
      "I didn't get there yesterday.  Today they have an ob 6750 for $298 out the door.\n\nI'll try that if the box looks ok.  The main negative I'm seeing is coil whine - but I have 30 days to return if it is a problem.",
      "If you check Tom’s GPU Hierarchy, the 6750xt seems like the clear choice. They have it outperforming every other card on your list except the 7700xt. \n\nBUT - it’s worth mentioning that the AMD cards don’t handle ray tracing as well. I don’t know how these specific cards compare, but it’s something to consider. \n\nI run a 6950xt (Also Microcenter, $499 with cpu purchase a few months ago!). I was starting to regret the purchase due to driver issues, but I installed the AMD pro drivers and haven’t had any problems since. I mention this to say that I’ve turned ray tracing on in Hogwarts and Cyberpunk, and didn’t find the difference big enough justify spending $200 more on a Nvidia card. Just my two cents",
      "Thanks for the info!\nI'm pretty focused on the 6750 right now.\n\nRay tracing enabled really drops the performance but that looks like it's the case with all AMD cards right now. I can live with that.",
      "Today there is a nob 6750 which would be $298 out the door.  \n\nI can't pass that up.",
      "I'd just buy the rx7600 and enjoy the same performance."

      "If what AMD said about the 7600 being 29% faster than the 6600 is true , it should be around 6% faster than the 6650XT (based on HUB comparison video of the 6650XT against the 6600) . \n\nSo, the RDNA 2  CU -> RDNA 3 CU performance jump seems to be quite small (both the 6650XT and the 7600 has 32 CUs) \n\nThe main differences between the 7600 and the 6650XT are -\n\n**TDP :**\n\n7600 - 165W\n\n6650XT - 180W\n\n**Memory Speed :**\n\n7600 - 18 Gbps\n\n6650XT - 17.5 Gbps\n\n**Base Clock, Game Clock and Boost Clock -**\n\n7600 - 1720 MHz, 2250 MHz and 2625 MHz\n\n6650XT - 2055 MHz, 2410 MHz and 2635 MHz\n\n**Bandwidth** -\n\n7600 - 288 GB/s\n\n6650XT - 280 GB/s\n\nThis difference is not relevant but the 7600 has around 13.3 billion transistors and a die size of 204 mm²  as compared to the 6650XT, which has 11.1 billion transistors and a die size of 237 mm² . The 6650XT is also built on the TSMC's 7nm node while the 7600 is built on TSMC's 6nm node",
      "So around the RX 6700 10gb price, which is likely faster with more VRAM, a wider memory bus and a full x16 lane\n\nTerrible value right now, buy it when it inevitably drops to $200",
      "That's the AMD way! Sell high, review badly, become great value once your brand is tarnished and nobody can afford Nvidia",
      "Remember when new 1080p gpus were 200-250 dollars, like…. 6 years ago?",
      "The RDNA3 CUs on Navi33 have their VGPR trimmed compared to Navi31 (128K vs 192K) while being the same as Navi2x (also 128K per SIMD). So architecture wise it's actually somewhere in between RDNA2 and RDNA3. The \"real\" RDNA3 CU like those on 7900 XTX have \\~17% perf improvements per clock as shown in AMD architecture slides.",
      "And they were *actually good mid-range offerings* rather than a straight-up joke?",
      "'very nice' is an interesting choice of words. Its extremely stagnant, dont compare it to msrps of last gen compare it to current selling price. Its a 6700 with av1 but loses 2gb of vram for the same price with slightly lower power draw. Thats a pathetic gen on gen increase when you compare to previous gens where at least a tier above if not two performance wise for the same price point was expected. TBH its pathetic that in 2023 a 250-300 dollar card targets 1080p when thats what the rx480/1060 did at the same price point in 2016. By now 1080p high settings should be relegated to the 50/50ti class cards especially when you compare it against the experience a console provides at its price point.",

      "we reached the point when 60 FPS in 1080p is a selling point.",
      "> So, the RDNA 2 CU -> RDNA 3 CU performance jump seems to be quite small\n\nYeah, iirc it was around 9% IPC improvement from the 6950XT to 7900XT/7900XTX when I did the math, so same clocks+same CU count would only put a card ~9% ahead, although 7600 is on 6nm rather than the 5nm of the 7900XT/7900XTX, so it *might* not even be as good of an improvement.",
      "200 in 2016 is equal to basically 250 in 2023. Inflation pays a part sure but mostly it’s Nvidia and to a slightly lesser degree AMD getting greedy.",
      "Soooo... the 6650XT is currently at 250 euros while this card costs 300 euros which is 20 euros more than the 6700 and 20 less than the 6700XT. I think that there is nothing more to add in regards to this pricing. Once it drops below 250 euros it will be a fine card, however if it had just a little bit more VRAM it would have been a good card below 250 euros.",
      "The A750 is $249 MSRP. AMD and Nvidia doing their best to increase Intel's market share.",
      "Maybe you want to stone me, but I believe that while 10 or 12 GB would have been nice, I think that für a 600 level card the 8gb should be fine. On the other hand I think that the 7700xt should have 16gb and the 7700 and 7600xt should have something in between. \n\nBut for the normal 7600 8 gb is ok in my opinion. The will probably be the cheapest card that AMS is going to sell and 8gb for the lowest entry is still fine.",
      "It feels like they're unsure of RDNA3 as a whole, they released the best cards they had and even those underperformed. They're lacking the confidence they had last gen",
      "Eventually, when the 5060ti releases in 3 years and is only 8 % better than a 4060ti, while being worse in some games and costing 499.",
      "They dropped the price to $200",
      "Reviews are today? Even then, a 29% performance increase versus the 6600 (if confirmed) means this is just a 6600XT/6650XT refresh sold as a non-XT card for pricing reasons.\n\n**Edit:** By the way, this is the GPU chip that was supposed to match the 6900 XT according to MLID? ROFL."

      "It may make sense to overprice it if they're still trying to clear 6700 XT inventory. For the same money you either get last gen with better performance or current gen with worse performance.",
      "Even when they cut prices, it's after gritting their teeth and taking too long.\n\nThe 7900 XT came down it price, but it took 6 months or more. That was to get to a price it should have been at launch. How impressive is it when you get a price cut after 6 months, and it's to where you should have been to start? You're still overpriced, IMO.\n\nThe 7800 XT fits this issue. People talked up that the 7800 XT had value because it replicated 6800 XT performance for $500, while the 6800 XT was a $650 card. Thing it, it released 3 years after the 6800 XT, which was already being discounted into the $500 range.\n\nPeople need to tell AMD (and Nvidia) to keep taking these prices and shoving them up their butts. A $1,000 7900 XTX being $920 (8% off!) during Black Friday a year after release sucks. A 7800 XT being a 6800 XT copycat for the same price as a 6800 XT sucks.\n\nThe market is trying to impose a universal price hike, and consumers need to smack it down.",
      "So more expensive than the 6700 XT but 15% slower?   \nWhat a joke\n\nFor this level of performance even 299 would be stretching it. At 329 it's DOA. Keep in mind, this is literally almost half the performance of a 7800 XT.",

      "Well yes, but they could've also not have launched it yet. \n\nUnless 6700xt stock is finally drying up",

      "They aren't wondering, they know why. Nvidia has had a 70+% share of the market for like a decade now, far longer than AMD's \"milk em' while we still can\" pricing strategy. They tried everything and they just lost, every time, regardless of how good or bad their GPUs were. \n\nThey've given up because most gamers just don't care and will shuffle their priorities around in any way possible to justify buying the latest Nvidia XX60 again and again.",
      "When you say \"regardless of how good,\" which generation do you think AMD's GPUs had any business \"winning?\" Thinking back to the last several:\n\nPolaris: Decent offerings with good value, but sat around for WAY too long. Didn't really compete beyond the 1060, meaning the 1070 and 1080 families faced no real competition.\n\nVega: You got all of two products, which launched during a mining frenzy. The $400 Vega 56 and $500 Vega 64 were it, since the Vega Nano got canceled. The V64 was a 1080 competitor that came out a year after the 1080. Yeah, you had the Radeon VII at the end of the generation, but it was just repurposing workstation silicon instead of tossing it, and the $700 price tag made it a non-starter for what it brought.\n\nRX 5000: RDNA came out with a good set of cards, but the 2070 was where they stopped competing. It left the top of the market untouched, while also competing a year after Nvidia's stuff was already in people's computers. If you were the target of an RX 5000 product, you were already a target of RTX 2000 a year earlier.\n\nRX 6000: AMD had a pretty compelling product here. The biggest issue here (other than the hole dug by the previous generations' woes) was the overall market. Everything was being gobbled up, production was spotty, so there was no ground to gain. Whether it was from crazy demand or tight supply, having everything sell through immediately is going to favor whoever's production is higher.\n\nRX 7000: Again, AMD's not competing at the top of the market, is late to market, and is generally not putting products on the shelves. The 7000 family launched with only the 7900 family, and one of those cards (XT) was comically overpriced for what it was. They spent another full year waiting to release the 7700 Xt and 7800 XT, which didn't provide any value or fill a market that was already being taken care of (6800 XT performance for then-current 6800 XT pricing isn't sending anyone running to the stores).\n\nAMD's been spending a long time firing most of its bullets into its own feet. Where Ryzen launched as a competitive product with aggressive pricing, Radeon products are often a combination of late to market, as far behind in performance as they are ahead on price, and generally not offering anything noteworthy for the wait. Ryzen offered a breakthrough in consumer core count for relative bargain pricing, then caught up on performance while staying price competitive on most every level.\n\nAMD's got loads of progress to make, if it wants. It just seems that AMD doesn't consider consumer GPUs to be a significant market. Whether it's superior margins with datacenter, inferior engineering, or something else, GPUs are a market where AMD is failing itself."

      "This generation from both sides is worse than Turing. Like dear God, what a let down. \n\nGetting the 6800xt/3080 at MSRP was about the best move you could’ve made in a loooooong time.",
      "In my country, 6700 xt is only 30 euros more. That's probably a better deal?",

      "The fact that Intel is still competitive is really really pathetic on Nvidia and amds front…\n\nGod Intel, please let battlemage actually be a huge jump.  WE DESPERATELY NEED COMPETITION!!!",
      "I'm gonna write something maybe controversial here:  this card could not be cheaper than 270 until the 6000 series is sold out.  Sure, it's basically the same as the 6650XT (which, when I bought mine 7 months ago for 280, is feeling  even more like an excellent purchase), but until the 6650XT is sold out, they couldn't exactly undercut themselves without also just lowering the price of the rest of the 6000 series.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat AMD should have done is simply not release the card until they've sold off their old inventory, but I think they feel pressured because Nvidia is releasing the 4060s and they want to get at least some press for released products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit:  Note it is very slightly better than the 6650XT, both in average performance and especially ray tracing and.. AV1 encode that I doubt many people will use.  If they're the same price, which they are, I'd get the 7600 if I was buying tomorrow.",
      "What you really get at the end of those cycles is a ruined reputation...  \n\n\nAt any rate the GPU itself is actually a bit atypical, it performs so close to the similarly configured 6650XT (same CUs count, similar memory configuration) that one is left wondering what is the performance uplift of RDNA3 over RDNA2.",

      "Amazon is selling the 6700 xfx 3 fan model for the same price as the 7600, no reason for anyone to buy a 7600.\n\nI think this is exactly what amd want, push people to buy old tech, while selling the 7600 at this price to the uninformed.\n\nOnce lest gen sells out, this price will drop.",
      "AMD for sure doesn't want to . EPYC makes much more money for them",
      "People still think that AMD drivers are terrible after all those years ( they are not perfect obviously , but not really worse or better that Nvidia ones )  Bad reputation is very hard to get rid of",
      "I think you're exactly spot on. AMD is a business. The PC market crashed. They made a ton of RDNA2 GPUs because of a huge demand which vanished over night.\n\nUntil those are sold there is very little reason to offer better value. Otherwise they will have to write down the old inventory. And writing down old inventory is a loss.\n\nCan't really blame them for it. And if you want the latest gen, worse case scenario overpaying $20 for a GPU is not the end of the world.",
      "It's a fantastic card if power consumption, size and heat are unimportant to you. The 6800XT is a better alternative and only slightly slower while consuming far less power. For the midrange a 6700 10Gb for 270 or 6700XT for a bit more are viable alternatives to these lackluster new cards. If you are on a tight budget the 6600 series and ARC 750 are the way to go since Intel has just dropped the price of a 750 to 200 dollars. Nvidia can spin as DLSS is not worth 100 or more dollars anyhow at this level of GPU. You need 60 fps or more for framge generation to make sense due to latency issues, especially in FPS type games.",
      "So happy with my 6800XT. Got it at a large discount a month ago and have 0 regrets!",
      "Turing had pretty decent improvement; it was just one of the few times where that came with a price hike. \n\nThe 2060 saw a $50 surcharge ontop of the $300 1060. Even then, it beat the 1070 by 10-15%. The 2070 was a lot more lackluster, but still. This 4060ti is in spitting distance of the 3060ti overclocked - that’s pitiful. I can’t recall a generation having that issue.\n\nThe Turing era wasn’t *that* bad after the refreshes. The refreshes were super good 2070S, 2080S. During that time the 5700xt ans 5700 came out which were insanely good for the $ too.",

To have a uniform access to the entire addressing space you have to use the same modules for the entire vram. That means for a 192bit bus you have total of 192bit/32bit = 6 modules that can either be 1 or 2GB capacity so 6GB or 12GB total. For 128bit bus that is 4 or 8GB. Other capacities on these buses are impossible unless you use uneven/non-uniform addressing space by mixing modules. Something similar was once done by Nvidia on a GTX 970 and received a backlash.

      "Literally only braindead idiots will buy this shit for $349",
      "Already discounted VAT for France (20%)",
      "At this point I am not afraid of saying it :\n\nPricing GPUs (Nv or AMD) has been just arbitrary since the crash of Crypto-Mining\n\nBecause reason has nothing to do with it",
      "Not when there are already GPUs that are cheaper ($270-280) that likely will perform similarly with 2GB more vram, aka the 6700 non-xt.\n\nRX 7600 **needs** to be a $250 or below GPU, unless it performs significantly better than I assume it does (I'm assuming roughly 10% higher performance than the 6650XT).\n\nAdding a small amount of performance while increasing the cost to having a similar FPS/$ to current GPUs only makes the GPU market more of a joke, especially when they don't add more vram.",
      "As a French citizen, we convert usually 1$=1€ (VAT, Transport, etc…)\nSo expect ~349$ in US",
      "At this current market climate I wonder why they even bother developing GPUs that aren't high end. 5700XT to 6700XT was pretty much stagnation already (a bit better performance for the same price increase and rather lackluster RT). And I doubt the 7600 will move the needle significantly. God forbid a 7500...  \nThe only real performance leaps I have seen are from high end cards and they are way too expensive. I'd rather get high end 6000 series card that ages probably better and comes with a significant discount.",
      "5700XT to 6700XT was extra performance and 59% more VRAM.\n\nI'm mostly disappointed they didn't make this a 10 or 12GB card. That would have killed the 4060Ti.",

      "what are you doing mate, they already converted it in the article, you just have to read it.",
      "That's really bad and a big disappointment if it's true. For that money you're very close to an actual 6700XT with 12gb. It also means it won't be the 1080p budget gaming card people were hoping it to be. 350 for a 1080p card is just too much at this point. \n\nThe 6650XT is also constantly dropping in price here in Europe, soon it will be under 270. That card will be much better positioned for 1080p gaming, but the hope was that we'd just get a generational improvement for about the same price, which seems reasonable given how long RDNA2 is already on the market. I guess it once again shows that AMD is not our friend.",
      "Agree, I live in France and we started to see the 6700xt below the 350 euros every once in a while unboxed. The used market goes even lower.\n\nTo go for the 6700xt at that price range would make more sense when it comes to performance AND price AND Vram.",
      "Tgat used to be the case, but nowadays we are paying more in euro than they are in dollars. They've got $750 7900XTs sometimes.. Cheapest in europe is €899 (same for 4070Ti).",
      "They could be gobbling market share right now, *while still turning a profit*, if they would just set their prices low enough. Instead of trying to maximize profit per card, focus on long term profits by getting more people on board with the AMD platform.",

Or they just want to profit from all the people that always want to buy on day one. \n\nBut I agree I think AMD needs to be more aggressive with the pricing to gain market share from Nvidia, aber they gained parity it would probably make sense economically to go back to high margins, but for now they really need to get more marker share. And this is not even from a consumer, but more from an investor perspective.",
      "I was thinking $299, but hoping for $249 but we all know amd don’t care bout us",

As for RT, idc much, but in some games like Metro Exodus, which changes the game drastically, it does matter. The only advantage imo AMD have is pricing. I got my 6700 XT for the same price of a 3060 back in October, and for that price comparison, its a hell of a beast.",

      "I'd say the 5700XT was not budget by design, but got put into the bargain bin by force of circumstance. The transistor count was close to that of a 1080ti and it was built on a then cutting-edge 7nm process. It was only the lack of performance that forced AMD to sell it at a lower price.\n\nA couple of years later I still kinda wonder whether that was down to shitty launch drivers as usual, as the 5700XT has FineWined and is now occasionally punching above the 1080ti in certain titles.",
      "It's replacing the RX 6600 and has a supposedly $30 cheaper MSRP compared to it, comes with 4 more CUs and new features. I'm going to objectively say, it is a nice RX 6600 replacement.\n\nThe thing that goes against it is that there's still some RX 6000 series cards on the market, and as such a RX 6600XT, 6650XT, 6700 10G, 6700Xt & 6750XT make more sense to buy today, but in 3-5 months, those cards will be gone, and the RX 7600 and whatever else RDNA3 is on the market will be the only AMD options. \n\nObjectively though, compared to RX 6600 it is a 30% better card for a \"supposedly\" lower MSRP.",

You used to be able to get a budget card for $100, a decent lower midrange card for $200, a strong midrange card for $300, and $400-500 were top of the stack. And then you'd have these weirdo dual cards for like $700 which would be the absolute best. \n\nMarket these days is a joke. \n\nThings were fine until 2018 or so tbqh. Then it all went to hell.",
      "6600 is the best budget options today, it launched at $330 MSRP, and sold for $600+ during the pandemic/crypto times, pretty much until February this year it was still around $300. This is replacing it with a $30 lower MSRP. So MSRP to MSRP they are giving us 30% more performance or roughly an overclocked 6650XT for $30 less. \n\nWe can continue yelling at clouds how cards in this performance range should cost around $200-250, but that's just yelling at clouds, the market scape for 4 years now is pricing this kind of performance between $300-400 and nothing will change that, except nobody buying such cards and we know this wont happen.",

The 6600 non-XT had a $330 MSRP, but that was increased preemptively due to the Cryptofuckening. They might make this 250-280 then.",

I regretted this as f*** when Horizen Zero Down whas struggling with that 4GB despite framerate being ok (for me, I'm casual gamer, I prefer better looks over 60+ fps).\n\nThats a fair point, you can play as you choose. But this card is really only good for 1080p gaming at maxxed out settings. At 1440p you will have to turn down settings. RT is basically not very good on a card like this. Thus at 1080p not many games will saturate 12GB of memory on alternative cards like an RX 6700 XT and other alternatives exist like a used RX 6800 which is not only faster but similarly priced with the same VRAM. So you're better off with one of those.\n\n> New gen will likely get better and longer support. Also in things like ROCm which is important for some people.\n\nSure but by the time the RX 6000 series is outdated you will have probably upgraded anyways. Think about the RX 480 and how much support it's received and to this day I would say it's not good enough for 1080p max settings gaming like it was back when it released in 2016. Point is, by the time support is an issue, its time for an upgrade anyway. ROCm is cool, but not much of a difference between 6000 series and 7000 series, unless you're looking at buying an R9 390 or older, it's pretty much a non issue.\n\n> 6700XT is more power hungry. If you are upgrading a few year old PC with 500-550W PSU, it's worth it instead of replacing PSU.\n\n[70W between a 6700 XT and a 7600, it's not much of a difference.](https://tpucdn.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-7600/images/power-gaming.png) If you're using an older PC with say a i5-2500 or something like that you're never going to exceed 550W.

Not an issue at all versus 310W.\n\n> Pleeeeease don't compare this with 4060Ti 16G, it's completely different price range\n\nEveryone knows that card is absolute garbage in terms of pricing. Most people compared it to a 6700 XT or a used 6800 or a RX 6700.\n\n> I'll buy this GPU the day the launch tax is done or maybe even earlier beacause I was waiting exactly for this for like half a year.\n\nGood for you.",
      "A sign that most people looking at a good enough upgrade for 1080p (whose GPU budget is only $350 max) are literally in a conundrum, despite the ~5-10% uplift and a narrow 128-bit bus/uber-large VRAM (that may not see good use well outside of those with PCIE 3.0 boards) for such a GPU in its class.\n\nTo highlight this conundrum (regarding the 7600XT) I talk about:\n\n-Yeah the 16GB may be useless on this level of performance especially that narrow bus, however so is the 4060 Ti 16GB and AMD at least does not ask for $500 lmao. The latter is way faster but so is the 7700XT which may be out of your budget.\n\n-The 6700XT exists and is the better buy for this segment, but it's getting hard to find depending on your market. Where I live it's either not available or prices are stupid (7700XT is sometimes cheaper like literally). If the 7600XT's real world gaming performance is quite close to the former, then it's something to think about at least.\n\n-Some games literally eat >8GB even at 1080p med-high. This card may show relief for such titles if FH5 is any indication. Good for me that rocks BC7 compression 2K custom Fallout 4 textures.\n\n-Some people have PCIE 3.0 boards. That huge VRAM can stave off the ill effects of the GPU's x8 lanes on PCIE 3.0 systems. \n\n\n-Your other choices are either a 4060 non-Ti which is only 8GB or the 3060 12GB which is slower than 7600 non XT.  Choosing the very former is a no-brainer if it were not for this VRAM conundrum we're in. \n\nTLDR: (paraphrased from an Anadtech comment) It may offer a compelling 1080p performance for a possibly reasonable price, that also gets past the 8GB conundrum while possibly undercutting the 4060s.\n\nAll I can say is that I do hope the 7600XT's real world performance is what TechPowerUp's prediction it will have. I can just get that instead (if prices are good) as 6700XT where I live is hard to find. Good enough for me if that's the case. No plans to upgrade from 1080p anyway.",

Sure I have to turn settings down, but whatever the 6700XT and 7600XT can produce at 1440p is leaps and bounds better than an RX580.

I would say it is better to have it OFF then ON, but perhaps I am more latency sensitive than most.\n\n\nRegardless, AMD could still compare the 7600XT to the 4060 both cards running naked. Just pure native frames, the way it used to be.",
      ">the super cards are just pushing the stack up one tier then discontinuing the old stack.\n\nNot really sure what you mean by this. The Super cards are basically upgrading the stack while either keeping pricing the same or improving it which is a much better move than most expected from Nvidia.\n\n4070 Super and 4070Ti Super are both pretty compelling cards imo and I'm probably looking to upgrade to a 4070Ti Super in the next few months to play games maxed out at 1440p. 4080 Super is decent too but mostly because it finally dropped from the horrendous $1200 price point of the original 4080.\n\nOverall these cards make RTX 40 a much better option for the next year until RTX 50 launches and I can't fathom buying an RDNA3 card over these unless AMD greatly reduces prices (which they might but we'll have to wait and see)."

      "Needs to be $300 IMO but it will get there eventually, probably after the 6700XTs are all sold.\n\nI am please they tested Halo Infinite as it goes to show how looking purely at frame rate does not always tell the whole story. It also reinforces my belief that someone (and given their expertise I think DF could be really good at this) needs to do testing in the style of [H]ardOCP where you compare maximum playable settings so you make IQ the variable and frame rate more fixed.",

But because Navi 33 has such a narrow bus they have to clamshell the memory and add 8GB where 2 or 4 would have been enough. \n\nThe 7600XT should have been a 10/12GB card on Navi 32 For around $350 for 3070/3070Ti performance. \n\nI just don't know who would want to spend $60 more than a 7600 for what looks to be less than 10% more performance. It's not a powerful enough card to run all the textures and RT that would use that 16GB of VRAM.",

Where I buy a XFX RX 580 8gig for $190 being it comes with a $60 game (The Division 2) I was going to buy on release anyways. \n\nSo +$130 to go from a 380 to a 580? Sure! Figure it's a temp upgrade for about a year. Then the 6000 series drops in late 2020 and I snatch up a surplus 5000 series on the cheap. As I said..... fool proof plan! \n\nand this is the point where I glaze over thinking back to 2020 and just stare off into space.......",

Now you might say, I don't care I'll upgrade my motherboard with my CPU in three, four, or maybe five years from now, but the point is, when performance and price are virtually identical, you have to look at other factors, and when doing so the fact is the 7600X is on a superior platform, it does consume less power, and it is easier to cool despite its love for the 95 degree TJ-max.

You can get 8gb of gddr6 for $25 pretty much and this happened around June 2023. With the lead time to a product launch, the August release of the 7700xt was likely planned prior to these prices collapsing.\n\n2. Yields of the dies are good enough AMD wants to up the CUs. It could also be AMD found 60 CUs at lower clocks is perfectly stable, so there's no need to cut down to 54 when they could sell 60 just at a lower clock speed.\n\nSo, there are at least two reasons I see for this that make sense."

Pairing a 7800X3D with a mid range GPU very rarely makes sense. Especially if you plan on getting a monitor with less than 240Hz anyway.",

Modern Cpus are insanely good and you don't even need the best, while modern game graphics can easily even push the best gpus to their limits.

Because of the high variance in player count between each event attempt (50-75 people) I had to do many benchmark runs and the event only runs every 2 hours. Just to get the baseline 6 runs each for two CPUs at one settings preset took 12 hours of logged-in time and potentially another 12 hours of wait time if you're trying to do multiple runs back to back.\n\nFor comparison it took less than an hour to run 27 benchmark runs of Cyberpunk 2077 when I was testing upscaling presets.

The 4060Ti 16GB uses a clamshell mode (each bus portion is connected to both sides of the PCB, allowing you to use double the capacity, for 2x2GBx(128bit/32bit) = 16GB of VRAM\n\nThe only way of using odd VRAM amounts is changing bus width (e.g. clamshell 96bit with 2x2GBx3=12GB) or odd sized memory chips (which apparently dont exist atm)",
      "To expand on this. Navi 33 (7600) is the full chip already. To make 12gb possible it would have to be reduced from 128bit bus to 96bit.\nSo the extra 4GB ram would hurt bandwidth instead. Not worth it.\nNavi 33 is also monolithic, that's why it's fairly power efficient.  \n\nNavi 32 however uses 4 mcd. The full chip with 4 mcd will most likely be the 7800(xt) with 16GB ram, and the cut down chip with 3 mcd will most likely be the 7700(xt) with 12GB ram. \n\nAnd power consumption will suffer alot compared to 7600, because of the mcd design. \n\nNavi 33 is also 204mm vs Navi 32 that's 200+ three or four 36.6mm mcds\n\nEdit:   \nWatch this to see how bad rdna3 mcd power consumption really is. \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HznATcpWldo&pp=ygUbNzkwMCB4dHggcG93ZXIgY29uc3VtcHRpb24g",

By the time FSR 3 comes out DLSS 3.0 will have matured and have made its way into games, basically meaning FSR 3.0 is probably going to have the same issue as previous iterations—adoption rate. Next problem will be RT performance, power consumption, content creation, and probably pricing to compete. \n\nAs seen with the comparison between the 4070Ti and 7900XT, rasterization performance alone isn’t going to sell a lot of cards, feature sets are going to dictate what card has better value. \n\nI had high hopes for AMD with the 7xxx series, but when I see basically normal generational steps up with their lineup while not pushing the envelop and charging high prices, it really disheartened me. \n\nNvidia, while still expensive, saw some nice gains, especially in the 4070Ti, while also bringing out a much more robust feature set at launch, and nailing the power consumption, unlike AMD that just keeps promising, is why I chose Nvidia this time around. \n\nC’mon AMD, innovate!

The current prices are insane, and the lowest RDNA 2 discounted cards are the only ones that remotely approach what i consider a fair pricing. \n\nSeriously, it wasn't long ago when the top end GPU was like $500. Then suddenly it was $700. And then it was $1000. And then $1200. And then $1600. \n\nIt's insane. \n\nHeck, I remember in the late 2000s you could get like a 9800 GTX for like $250 or something. \n\nI remember my first GPU being a $80 3650 and my first \"REAL\" GPU being a 5850 for like $300 or something.\n\nAnd that was like the fourth strongest single card on the market at the time, only below the 5870, 470, and 480. \n\nI mean I remember when the market had like several tiers of products in the $100-200 price range alone.

Well, you're probably AMD. Then again there's nothing positive to say about Nvidia's except the 4090 is a huge leap... When's intel dropping some new hotties?\n\nAnyone in this price tier should either grab a 6700 10 GB while they still exist, or go used. I got a 6700 xt for 220 with 2 years warranty left a couple days ago. And sales tax here is 15% so even more savings there. Receipt price is 1265 from the scalpocalypse... Oof.",

I know it's a poor gen on gen upgrade, it's quite a boring GPU for guys like us but if you already own a 6600/xt/50xt you don't really need an upgrade. \n\nNew people building PCs in a few months will appreciate the 7600. People still on a RX 580 or GTX 1060 who finally decide to upgrade, it's good for them.",

      "Usually new gen offers better value than old gen even if it's on its way out. At least if it's interesting. To get better value on a 2080 ti than a 3070, you had to buy used. 980 ti was also terrible value when 1080 ti was launching same for 780 and 980, etc. Otherwise why launch it? Just keep giving us rdna 2 if it's better value. It's not like there's new tech even on offer. Like how is your launch supposed to be exciting if all it's making me wanna do is buy your older stuff?\n\nAnd what's worse is 6650 xt's have been available around this price for like 6-12 months. So who's this card for? Anyone who wanted this type of performance at this type of price could've had it for the last year and been gaming away. It would've been substantially better value, if you buy it now it's more of a giving in \"ughhhh fine\" than exciting.",
      "The used market has its own drawbacks.\n\nDue to AMD's aggressive new pricing, I don't find used RDNA2 cards to be worth it tbh. The price is slightly lower than new, but you still have to pay sales tax and likely much more for shipping.\n\nFor example, after shipping the *cheapest* BIN 6600 on eBay is 160, when you can get a brand new one with a game and free shipping for 180.\n\nHWS is an option, but imo any legitimately good deal gets purchased so quickly that you pretty much have to F5 to actually get anything. And Facebook Marketplace is complete fucking garbage frankly and a huge PITA in my experience.\n\nYou could buy a gen older used, but that has its own clear disadvantages too.",
      "The more you buy, the more you save😎",
      "I honestly think that the 7600 is an impressive step forward for a card that performs quite a bit better than the 6600 and 6600xt. \n\nFor the price you are paying for, along with more modernized core architecture, its a good buy. And as per always, AMD normally makes their cards very competitive as time goes on with better drivers altogwther.",
      "Yeah, tbh I dislike how AMD is getting flack for properly clearancing their products instead of artificially holding last gen pricing up and delaying next-gen until they're 98% gone.\n\nOlder cards have always been the better deal because GPU makers need to get rid of them. As they are more expensive to make than newer ones for the same performance tier and use more power. So they kind of have to be the better deal in the current market or they'll never be able to sell them.\n\nWas the 1070 a bad card because the 980 TI was clearanced under 400? I think Nvidia *not* clearancing Ampere pricing for so long really screwed with people's memory.",
      "Reviewers yes, we'll see what consumers think.",

It should have much more performance than it has now. \n\nHeard VR performance isn't very good on the 7000 series, not sure if those have been fixed yet.\n\nThe 7900XT should've launched as the 7800XT for a much lower MSRP, due to its relatively poor performance uplift. It's incredibly overpriced, judging by how many times the price has been cut on it.\n\nThe 7900XT also caused a weird situation where they can't really launch their actual 7800XT and not make it look terrible in performance or price compared to their discounted RDNA 2 cards. Basically the performance of the 7900XT is on par with what the 7800XT should've been.",

It's put them in a tight bind on placing the rest of the RDNA3 SKUs because they are competing directly with their OWN products and there are no features/ incentives to get it over a similarly priced and likely better performing RDNA2 card.\n\nBy the time this actually hits the shelves, prices will likely have dropped even more on current GPUs.",

      "7600 XT coming out soon with no N32 cards on the horizon, it does make me wonder if AMD might not just skip the N32 DIE for desktop completely and move on from RDNA3 as soon as they can.\n\nIf we are being realistic, RDNA3 doesn't really bring anything new to the table that would warrant paying more for it if you don't need AV1. So anyone looking for value, will buy a discounted RDNA2 card, for everyone else who wants RT and FrameGen, they will grab something from Nvidia at a premium price.\n\nThen we see a number of reports that 4070s are not selling very well, with cards dropping below MSRP in some regions, with Microcenter in the US even offering $100 Steam Gift Cards On All NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Purchases.\n\nAMD might decide it's not worth it, push out the 6 class cards asap and call it a day while continuing to sell the discounted RDNA2 stock. Even this 7600XT is going to be a hard sell against discounted RDNA2 cards, $299 MSRP might make it worth a look but it's not exciting in the least.",
      "Honestly as an AMD fanboy, I thought the 4070 looked decent. Basically low power consumption 3080 with all the lovelace features for $600. It's just there are many alternatives at that price point (even the PS5); you might find the 6950xt for $600 which is an alternative. There is no real advantage in RDNA3 over RDNA2 besides performance, so you're not gonna miss out much imo.",

      "Give it a few months and it probably is at $350",
      "I disagree. The 4070 is only a decent option because if the price being somewhat close to reasonable. (Especially with the Microcenter $100 steam card promo). When you bump it up to $800, 12GB of vram is absolutely unacceptable. That’s the type of card you would be trying to use ray tracing with, which will just make the vram issue even worse. \n\nI would step up to a 4080 before I would consider a 4070ti. At least then I can do the extra things I can’t do on a 4070 for more than a year.",

Nvidia is still dominating market share by almost 9:1.\n\nPricing to market maintains the status quo. If they want to gain market share they need to be as aggressive as possible.\n\nObviously they still need to profit. Nobody anywhere has ever suggested they sell cards at a loss.",

      "Exactly. Nvidia still has its CUDA advantages that lock a lot of people in from the jump. On top of that, AMD's now jacking up pricing in a manner similar to Nvidia, but using features that aren't good enough to justify it. They haven't delivered on FSR 3. Their RT performance is inferior. They're losing on efficiency.\n\nWhen AMD's pricing is better value than Nvidia, but worse than last-gen products from AMD currently on store shelves, what's the selling point? When AMD starts using \"the new features are great\" to promote their products that are worse than Nvidia at those things, in the hopes they'll justify their pricing model that sucks, they just make themselves look bad.\n\nFrom one side of their mouths, AMD and their supporters are talking up \"as good at Nvidia at raster,\" while using the other sides of their mouths to tell us RX 7000 is worthwhile over RX 6000 because of new features. They lose at both ends.",

      "Yuuuuup. But I buy Nvidia so that makes me a rube, not someone who wants the features they offer and can afford the cost, and you buy AMD because you're a renegade, sticking it to the man, robbing the rich to give to the....rich.\n\nIt's all bullshit.

After they run out of RDNA2 stock, then AMD can drop the prices on those cards, and trap Nvidia with nothing viable in the $200-$400 range and a ton of RTX 3000 cards rotting on the shelves, it'll be a brilliant move, if true.",
      "\"It's not a fucking charity,\" is a terrible counterpoint. No one's asking them to lose money on cards or give them away for free. AMD's also sitting at a marketshare that's lower than necessary because they keep pushing people to Nvidia with a mix of rising prices, delayed/buggy features, lesser performance, and slow releases.\n\nThis isn't AMD matching/overtaking Intel with Ryzen. They're still floundering from miles behind Nvidia without a path to significant marketshare with products that could earn it. People aren't running around saying \"I want a free card,\" they're saying they'd buy AMD's stuff if AMD were reasonable.\n\nWith as bad as the RX 7000 release has been (7900 XT was too expensive, 7800 XT took too long, both apply to the 7700 XT), I've been sitting on my 5700 XT for basically 2 years longer than I intended. Between friends and relatives, there are probably 10 different PCs that I'd normally have upgraded or helped people upgrade, but I just haven't because the products aren't good enough, and I'm confident that I'm not alone.\n\nIf they released the 7800 XT 6+ months ago, I'd have bought one. Now, I'm fine to wait until Black Friday to evaluate the 7900 family's pricing because buying a 7800 XT that performans like a 6800 XT for the price of a 6800 XT isn't appealing.\n\nPlenty of us here arguging against AMD's pricing are interested consumers. AMD's losing business from it, and it's not like they're gaining on Nvidia in spite of us.",
      "A cut-down version of Navi 32 with 10GB would imply a memory bus of 160bit, which I see a bit strange as every MCD sports a 64bit memory bus.\n\nA 12GB card would use 3 MCDs, being the 4th disabled (probably was already defective), but a 10GB would use 2MCDs and half of the 3rd one. For me, it sounds very strange.\n\nI would not be surprised if they are rebrands of the 6700 10GB and 6700XT 12GB. They also fill the performance gap.",
      "This must be on N32, since N33 cann't suport 10GB at all (unless we have a GTX970 situation) and would only support 12GB with either 24Gbit modules or the cursed clamshell option of 16Gbit+8Gbit.\n\nSlotting these in at 40 and 48CU for the 10 and 12GB respectively would fill out the mainstream lineup, but they shouldn't both be the 7600XT. We got mad at Nvidia over the 4080s, and I don't think we should accept it from anybody else either. 48CU/12GB needs to either be a 7650XT or the RX7700 for the naming scheme to hold up imo."

      "> Or it could just be Navi 33 with faster clocks or memory.\n\nFaster memory yes - they could probably go with 20 GHz GDDR6 - but higher core clock is a maybe. 7600 already has the highest core clock of any RDNA3 card. There is a chance that they can go a little higher, as 6500XT (on the same 6nm process) runs 160 MHz faster (boost). That’s 6% faster than 7600 - a fairly small gap - and the card will probably draw 200W if you do that. Doesn’t seem worth it to me?",

If they launch a 7600 XT, I find it more likely it'd be an overclocked RX 7600 with 16GB of faster VRAM instead.\n\nDrop the 7600 to like $239 and launch the 7600 XT with 10-15% better performance and 16GB VRAM for $299.

RT on ANY of these cards is kinda irrelevant, it sucks enough you won't use it.\n\nIf you remember, back in 2018 the outgoing Gtx 1080ti cards were getting fire saled for $450. If you bought a 1080ti at that time and kept it because \"the Rtx 2000 series is overpriced\" you'd have survived the mining craze, made thousands of dollars during the mining craze with that card, and still in 2023 have a card that competes with brand new cards costing $250+. Like, that's how BAD this value proposition is.\n\nEven if you bought a 5700xt at $450 at launch in 2019... well you'd have a Rx 6700xt right now because miners were trading new 6700xt cards for used 5700xt cards because the 5700xt was one of the best mining GPUs per watt.",
      "I don't get why amd even bothers releasing these cards so late. A day and a dollar short every time. \n\nBe within the week, or don't bother, really. Unless your product is better, then release a month later."

      "The AM4 equivalent is significantly inferior in several ways though.  They aren't directly compatible.\n\nThey represent the lowest allowed spec on the chipset + socket in both cases.  AM5 requires significantly stronger power delivery, bios capacity, and DDR5, all of which cost more.\n\nThere IS no 'equivalent' AM4 board.  There are none with similar power delivery either.    AM5 has SVI3,  AM4 has SVI2.   This means different power ICs and mosfets -- and these are not yet high enough volume to bring prices down.  (once Zen4 Epyc is ramped up and these have greater supply, it will lower costs quite a bit for AM5).  So you can't compare the # of phases of some AM4 board to an AM5 one and declare them the 'same'.  \n\nAre mobo manufacturers trying to take a larger cut?   Probably.   But there is competition, and when prices don't lower while there is sufficient competition, the reason must be either supply constraints or higher costs.\n\nIts a little of both here:  higher costs for DDR5 mobo traces/layers, higher costs for various power delivery components, and related supply issues for power ICs for those (that essentially keep costs higher).",

But of course both the entry-level Intel and AMD may lack PCIe 5 support, or only have it on NVMe, or other weird bullshit.\n\n(PS: it's easier to just select Socket: LGA1700 unless you want to filter for specific chipsets! ;)\n\nNow of course... does that really matter to users?  DDR4 is still very competitive in gaming and if it allows you to go with a cheaper CPU and a cheaper motherboard maybe that's not an awful decision for losing 5% here and there.  13600K is a very competitive CPU for the price, so is 5800X3D, and if you have memory already and maybe a motherboard then AM5 still looks like an overall bad deal even if \"it's got DDR5\".\n\nAnd Zen4's memory controller is *really fucking bad*, like it probably won't POST with 4 sticks unless they're single-rank and low-speed.  [wendell talks about it here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P58VqVvDjxo) but it's not really limited to 128GB, it's any dual-rank sticks, and even a lot of single-rank sticks don't do great with 4 slots, and you are going to significantly reduce available bandwidth (from 70GB/s with 2 sticks down to about 50GB/s - this is not insignificant). You are basically buying the ddr5 equivalent of the early super finicky b350 boards.\n\nHUB being HUB of course they completely shat on DDR5 for a year straight when it was Intel-exclusive, it *just isn't ready yet guys*, meaning AMD hadn't launched theirs yet, but the moment AM5 launched that was the moment DDR5 was ready and you were a big moron if you were still buying DDR4.  Truth be told it still is not ready yet, things haven't changed from july or august really other than AMD having their product out now (and it's much worse than Intel in terms of memory controller).  The launch gouging was winding down within a couple months, decent RAM came out within a couple months, but the AMD platform just isn't there yet.  \n\nWe will see what prices do in the future, AMD is supposedly designing their platform around smart power stages, which drives up the cost relative to AM4 (and LGA1700), and AMD is intent on selling you 2 chipsets even if they aren't needed (de facto this is just moneygrubbing from AMD - nobody actually connects more than 3 pcie slots even on a $1300 board, nobody really needs the expansion from the second chipset, it's just a way for AMD to capture a little more revenue selling you something that's hardly even used).  Prices may not come down as much as people are hoping, and when AMD says \"cheaper boards are coming\" what they most likely mean is A620, ie even shittier and worse boards, not so much that decent B650/X670 boards are going to come way down.\n\nEven as someone who is really into the idea of a AVX-512 + v-cache system, I'm really dubious about that memory controller and I think it's probably better to just wait a year and see what happens.  I expect 8000 series chips and better motherboards and lower prices will fix most of the complaints.",
      "The problem is the mobos were massively overbuilt since stock power usage went up so much. Even entry level.",

      "No. Prices are basically the same from B660 and Z690 MSRP to B760 and Z790 MSRP. The pricing difference is mostly because 600 series is 'old' and thus is on sale now, despite being 95% as good. You can find more 700 series boards under $200 than you can AM5 board.",

      "According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",
      "So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously",
      "The overhead is minimal for both AMD GPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, which is probably why reviewers didn't look at the overhead until Intel GPUs came along.",
      "We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.\n\nMy current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.\n\nPlaying off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",
      "> Unless you're running a CPU that's many many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about. \n\nThat's just not true with Battlemage.\n\nCPUs released in 2024 showed the issue in testing.  \n\nIt's not year of release, it's capabilities.",
      "It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.\n\nAlchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.\n\nAMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",
      "No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.\n\nThe main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",
      "On an older post an Intel graphics engineer explained the issue, it isn't what you said. Intel is too verbose in commands which slows everything down.",

      "HUB used DX12 games that also showed the issue.  It's something else.",
      "I'm fairly sure they use dxvk for d3d9 to 11.",
      "The comment to which I am replying is talking about nVidia, not Intel.",

      "The 6700 is literally 5-10% faster, has more vram, and one of the best 3rd party cards can be had for the same price. \n\nWhat’s even crazier is according to hardware unboxed they set the initial price to be $300.\n\nI wonder what it’s gonna take for amd and nvidia to pull their head out their own asses. One can hope intel competition would do this, but call me a pessimist, I have a feeling intel will be right there besides them in a couple years.",
      "In a few process upgrades, they'll need microscopes and extra fine tweezers to handle the GPU dies for the lower end graphics cards.",
      "why would anyone ever choose this over 6700xt?",
      "Holy shit this card is even worse than imagined…",
      "> For example I expected the 7600 to rival the 6700xt for small price cut. Is that unrealistic ?\n\nthe question is \"small price cut\" versus what?\n\nif it's versus MSRP... the problem is a lot of these cards have incredibly distorted MSRPs because they launched into the pandemic/mining.  6700XT is a $480 MSRP card, which was acknowledged to be trash at launch, same for 3070 Ti and so on.  But if AMD/NVIDIA didn't charge a higher MSRP, scalpers would do it for them.\n\nI think a lot of people *think* it should be vs street prices, but RDNA2 prices are currently in an extreme firesale.  And despite a lot of confabulation/false recollection beating firesale prices is not really the norm.  Firesales are firesales, they're intended to get you to take the older crappier thing at a better perf/$ vs the newer, more efficient, more featureful one.  980 Ti for example was cleared out way way below 1070 MSRP, and Pascal is literally held up as the model generation for pricing.  780 Ti was cleared out at $180 or so after GTX 970 came out (I bought two for our machines), and at launch the 780 Ti was a faster card.\n\nAnd paradoxically this discourages firesales because reviewers just go \"buy a 1080 Ti\" instead of a 2070.  Why have firesales if they're just going to get you blasted in reviews?  That's why NVIDIA hasn't done it since Pascal - reviewers shit on them because of the firesales (from their perspective) so \"no more firesales\" is an easy (and profitable) way to make your reviews better.\n\nAMD is, for the first time, having their own \"Turing moment\" where their older RDNA2 cards are on extreme firesale and the RDNA3 cards are not that appealing in comparison, they just didn't make a very good advancement and there isn't a lot of visible perf/$ progression.\n\nAnd again, just like with Turing, and just like with the demands for Ampere overproduction/etc... people can pitch a fit all they want, it's not going to lead to the outcome people want, it's going to backfire on you.\n\nTo me the street price comparison in the days leading up to launch is completely pointless.  What we really need is a more sophisticated handling of whether MSRP was any good for the comparison points.  3060 Ti - really good MSRP, never available.  6700XT - terrible MSRP, way better street prices that are very available.  How do you compare that?  I think you need to set a baseline, like \"3070 for $500 is an average-tier product for last gen\" and make comparisons on both old+new products against that.  Because very obviously some of the MSRPs are trash and others were amazing yet completely fictitious.  But this is *completely* a judgement call and there is no objective way to do this.  And much like reviewers just don't wanna touch image quality anymore (unlike in the old days of FX vs Radeon, etc) it's much easier to just put out a \"product bad\" review.  I'm not saying it's great, but expecting it to beat intense firesale street prices is a little unrealistic - just like 2070 vs 1080 Ti was.  \n\nThis will get me in trouble but:  Turing wasn't *that* bad a launch, but, it had to go up against intense firesales from the second great mining boom and it was just not up to the task of beating 1080 Tis selling at half MSRP.  So NVIDIA decided to never let cards sell for half MSRP again.  Is that what people want AMD to do?  That's a real easy call for them to make.\n\nPeople are really upset because they feel like they've been sitting patiently and waiting for three years and they're *still *getting screwed.*  But the RDNA2 prices *are* the benefit here, those are really good prices and even matching them from a new product generation is great, generally you will not get to double-dip hugely on top of firesales.",
      "Hard to make profit if suddenly no one buys their gpus anymore, long term grabbing market share would make more sense imo.",
      "It’s better longevity but you lose the real ‘on the ground’ aspect of it. It also gets difficult when,  for one reason or another, MRSP doesn’t really exist (2080ti, 6000 series, 3000 series, etc). \n\nI’d much rather have Hardware Unboxed’s style of reviewing. Especially when they do updates and genuinely do look at regional pricing then rank performance off of that.\n\nIt muddies the waters by making it more complicated, but I really appreciate that sort of thing. These cards are meant to replace the old, and seeing how they stack up (currently) against them is important imo.\n\nI see your point 100% though",
      "Exactly. The 6600 vs 3050 is the perfect example. I knew people bought 3050s but even then I was surprised to see 5x more people own 3050s than 6600s in Steam's hardware charts. Oh, and reviewers also shat on that card."

The 7800XT is seeing maybe a 25 -30% bump in performance in best case scenarios with better RT performance, and the 7700XT is probably seeing similar results, but when compared to their last gen-counterparts the 7700XT is probably looking more like a re-badged 6800 possibly XT, and the 7800XT is basically a re-badged 6950XT with better RT performance.\n\nThe only card in there that's worth noting is the 7800XT, it'll be almost comparable to a 4070Ti, which I just upgraded from 6700XT to. The 7700XT looks like it'll fall victim to the same fate as the 6700XT, priced in no-man's land with middling performance.\n\nI was talking to some friends earlier about this--for the 7800XT to even succeed it has to be priced \"realistically\" no higher than $650-$700 only because Nvidia is the go-to for a lot of gamers, AMD has a lot of ground to cover, and despite what some might say, Frame Generation is probably the best feature I've seen on a GPU in a long time; that and DLSS support sold me on switching sides for this gen. DLSS has been one of the features keeping Nvidia on top these past few gens, even against comparable AMD cards, and FSR just hasn't had the impact DLSS had, even being open source, the adoption rate and IQ combined versus DLSS has put it way behind.\n\nIt pains me to see how the x700 series being given the treatment it's getting. The 5700XT was such a great card, and the 6700XT improved upon it, but marginally, but still offered performance relative to a 2080Ti. The fact that the 7700XT might not even hit 6800XT levels of performance means this card is going to have to be realistically priced at $400-$450 for it to succeed, otherwise they're just handing Nvidia a victory this generation. The 4070, it's competition is going to be utilizing DLSS 3, and frame generation which is, in the eyes of the average consumer who doesn't understand tech but can read numbers is going to gravitate towards. The only thing that would push people to the 7700XT is if the 4070 is priced outrageously. Even then if Nvidia releases a 4060/Ti, it's probably going to eat the 7700XT's lunch in terms of sales.\n\nThe 7600XT is literally just a rebadge, plain and simple. Nothing to see here. :(\n\nSorry for the long post, but honestly the only card that piqued my interest from this gen would have been the 7700XT, but after pulling the trigger prematurely and getting the 4070Ti, honestly I'm happy I did. As much as it pains me to stray from team Red after six years,but I wanted something that was a step up from mid-range that would give me the option to play in 4k without spending over $1000, and I got the 4070Ti for $900 after sales taxes, which isn't bad for basically 3090Ti levels of performance, and about $132 less than what I would have gotten a sapphire/power color 7900XT. Was it pricey? Hell yes, but with it's performance level I'm easily seeing a good 3-4 years of usage from it, namely at 1440p.\n\nIt should be telling that the 4070Ti, despite it's price, is a card that AMD is going to have a tough time competing with considering it's nearest competitor, the 7900XT is only marginally better for $100-$150 more, and with the prices of the 7700/7800XT being unknown, AMD's got their hands full trying to figure a price that'll entice buyers. That's of course if these rumors are true.\n\nWhat do you guys think? You think AMD is on track, or do you think they blew their load a bit prematurely and forgot about the lower echelon of the RDNA3 cards?\n\nEdit: To clarify I was hoping and praying for AMD to pull a sucker punch on Nvidia and catch them off-guard to bring balance to the GPU market. I'm still hoping they do, or at least sell well, I would love to see AMD continue the trend of keeping Nvidia's pricing somewhat in check and maintaining decent performance, otherwise spending $900 on what can be viewed as mid-range will be nothing but a pipe dream in the years to come. I'm an AMD guy at the end of the day, even when the i7-2600k was god-tier I opted for AMD. ",

The highest model was the 5**7**00 XT, which was a clear indicator that it competed with the 20**7**0 (Super).\n\nLikewise, the 6**9**00 XT at least had a claim to fighting the 30**9**0 when it came to 1080p and 1440p without RT.\n\nBut the 7**9**00 XTX is only a match for the RTX 40**8**0 (which is significantly gimped compared to the 4090), and the RX 7**9**00 is hardly a match for the 40**7**0 **Ti**. Keep in mind that the RX 6**8**00 competed with the 30**7**0 **Ti**. I have no doubt that a 4080 Ti is coming as well.\n\nIt's clear that all RX 7000 products below the 7900 XTX are more gimped versions than they would have been, had AMD decided not to name that SKU as such. Navi 32 and 33 not having more Compute Units than their predecessors (like N31) combined with the name-fuckery means that AMD will have to offset core reductions on low & mid-range products with clock increases to try to have barely-not-stagnant performance.

It's almost as if the x700 line of cards are designed to be replaced every gen. They don't leave much headroom for newer games/graphical features when it comes to performance, almost as if they're designed around games that were released the year prior. \n\nI just couldn't bring myself to get excited for the 7xxx series GPU's. I was hyped at first, especially for the 7700XT, but I got hit with what will be ultimately a letdown and a reality check about AMD's mid-range left me wondering when will AMD start offering more than just performance bumps, features for instance. Sure we got FSR and RSR, but compared to DLSS they're inferior, naturally because Nvidia put an AI chip on their cards specifically for DLSS. Now Nvidia's rolling out DLSS 3 with Frame Generator and good lord, once they get the kinks worked out it'll be a monster. \n\nI just hope AMD can figure something out quick, instead of trying to go blow for blow with Nvidia; that's a fight they will not win.",

      "X1900 XTX was the first in 2006 fallowed by the 1950 XTX.",
      "Tbh I'm expecting prices to be a lot better than many doom and gloomers. 7900 XT is starting a hundred less than the 6900 XT and not selling. AMD tends to be quick to adjust prices to market, so I think it'll drop to 800, although probably not formally (AMD seems to favor reimbursing retailers behind the scenes to cut prices rather than formally adjusting MSRP).\n\nThe 7800 XT has 5/7 the CU count and value increases as you go down the stack. 5/7 * 800 = 571. So the 7800 XT is probably gonna be 550-630.\n\n6700 XT and below MSRP's were set during the shortages, 25% tariff, and cryptofuck epidemic. So they were higher than otherwise.\n\nThe 7700 XT is going to be getting 20% more CU's than the 6700 XT, so it will have 80% of the 7800 XT. Again, value tends to increase down the stack until you hit the 6 series. So .80 * 571 = 456.80. So probably 400-450 and it'll perform a bit over halfway between the 6800 and 6800 XT, probably closer to the 6800 XT.\n\n7600 XT is probably gonna be around 6700 XT performance. 7700 XT has 50% more CU's than it, 456.80 * 0.66 = 304). The 6 series is where value tends to drop off, so I think it'll be 300-340.\n\nThe 7600 is 28 CU's, or 7/8 the 6600/7600 XT. So it should be no trouble to match a 6600 XT and will probably come close to the 6650 XT. As for the price, 320 * 7/8 = 280.\n\nA lot of this will depend on what Nvidia is doing, but assuming Intel continues unfucking the drivers and reliably delivers 6700/XT level performance at 250 with the A750, competition is fierce."

      "Good, these cards suck. In fact, most new cards suck, when you consider all of the stuff going on with price, performance, and features. I was watching a GN video from a little while ago about the terrible state of motherboards on modern chipsets. They've taken basic features from 20 years abo (like relaying POST codes to the user) and turned it into a premium feature limited to $350+ boards.\n\nAn anonymous employee quoted in that video referred to it as something like, \"malicious segmentation\" of the products. It seems like GPUs are in a similar state. There is a more aggressive stripping of baseline features on newer cards, as if they're trying to lock people with lower- and mid-range GPUs out of options other than \"buy a new GPU.\"\n\nOverclocking is basically left to exotic cooling solutions, as these companies have gotten more aggressive with power deliveryand maxing out cards. It's bad enough that undervolting is the new overclocking--people who would rather have 95% of performance for 85% of the power draw, versus having GPUs pushing 500W out of the box.\n\nThe cut-down PCIe and VRAM seem to be how these companies are doing it today. When your 1080p card has 8GB of VRAM for ~$300, it's pretty awful. The scaling to 1440p is poor, and the ability to sit on the fence between \"higher fidelity 1080p\" and \"lower fidelity 1440p\" gets tougher to pull off. You can't OC, and you don't have the VRAM to handle 1440p as well if you could. These low- nd mid-range products don't seem to be made around budget customers and providing value. Instead, they seem to be intentionally hamstrung to make sure you get punished for not buying at the top of the product stack. The goal isn't giving you something affordable to meet your needs, it's to give you the absolute bare minimum so they can force you into being a repeat customer.",

To list some: WoW, FF14, GW2, OSRS, SC2, Stellaris, some newer RTS games, BG3, KSP, Factorio etc.\n\n A 7600 EXPO + 4090 system would be about 2.5 - 3x more severely CPU bottlenecked in those situations by comparison since a 4090 is twice as fast and a 7600 is much slower. In BG3 you're looking at something like the CPU being able to do a stuttery 80fps in city while a 4090 is chill at a smooth 400 plus.",

RX 6700 / 6700 XT / 6750 XT sold like fresh bread due to the new and great nVidia release, RX 6650 XT and RX 6600 are best-buy for their prices also (and actually sell).\n\nThis connector issue was found out and blown up before any user even complained of it, since they aren't usually as wide to not fit. Meanwhile AMD cards are more power efficient for the performance they offer than nVidia's.\n\nNvidia 12-16pin (how you prefer to call it) power connector keeps melting but users are blamed as if they never used 6pin and 8pin and other connectors for decades already and this one is the first one to melt. But I assume that news flew by you even though it is still happening.\n\nAnd Intel consumes twice the power of nVidia and AMD for half the performance, absolute inefficiency but a worthy effort for a 1st gen that keeps improving lots by driver updates.\n\nOnly thing sad and wrong is your pessimistic attitude.",
      "The problem is bad publicity. \n\nIt suggests an oversight in a really basic design element of their GPU, to which people will naturally extrapolate \"if they couldn't get that basic obvious thing right, what other more complicated stuff did they get wrong?\".\n\nAMD deals with a general negative perception from the market already, it doesn't need to help things along with silly unforced errors.",

      "If that is what you’d consider a big stink.. the world must literally smell like shit to you my dude.",

There's the unflattering positioning of products (7900 family competing with Nvidia's 80 series, rather than 90, 7600 being more like a 4050 Ti competitor). There's the BIOS issues with the X3D chips.\n\nThe 7600 reviews included inconsistent price messaging to press/AiBs, bad driver availability to press, and then the connect issue. There's just too much sloppiness in AMD's delivery of products, and it's seemingly gotten WORSE.\n\nRyzen did a good job of forcing AMD's into positivity among users and the press. That momentum's really slowed in the last year or so, and they're seemingly reliant on Nvidia's terribly pricing to carry them in sales. It just doesn't feel like AMD has a good grip on its customer base or its products. Having technical, marketing, and design flaws be what feeds the recent bias of the masses isn't good for business, even if this isn't a major problem in and of itself.",
      "I see the connector issue as a design issue. No one thought of users having to plug it in? What does RAM do when it's fully in? It clicks. What does 8-pin connector do? The plastic latch is engaged. Could pull on the cable lightly to check if it is all the way in or look/feel the latch position. What does the main PCI-E slot do when you insert a GPU? A latch locks the card in place. It is not coming out until you push on the plastic bit. If you can pull GPU out, it wasn't in correctly to begin with. Designs with user-error in mind.\n\nThe new connector? Are they expecting people to go in with a magnifying glass to see if it is all the way in? What do they expect?",
      "You're right. The 12-pin issue is still a problem on 4090s. Enough so that the topic is being revisited by YT reviewers and repair shops.",
      "No, he does not need insider info. The wording very much suggests that there are units out there with retailers that have this issue.\n\nEdit: if this was a pre mass production issue and affected only the cards sent to the reviewers, AMD would have just outright said it. Even better, they would have said that in the reviewer guidelines that they send to every reviewer along with the cards. No need to say \"will be fixed\".",
      "Why are you so defensive",
      "It’s a budget card and that standard is still being adopted. AMD wanted to make it compatible with non-ATX 3.0 compatible PSUs, knowing that the card is a budget one and most people who buy it will not have a ATX 3.0 compatible PSU."

      "This generation has just been one big L for both AMD and NVIDIA.\n\nFor AMD, the only cards that make sense are MAYBE the 7900XT for high-end 1440p gaming - and even that could be achieved by a 6950XT or 4070 Ti, and the 7900XTX if you want great 4K gaming, and even then $1000 is a big premium for a card that should be $800 max.\n\nFor NVIDIA, the only cards that could make sense are MAYBE the 4070 for 1440p gaming, DLSS3 and AV1, which even then is $600 and also too much... and the 4090, which is so expensive that most people would never be able to afford it.\n\n4080 is WAY too expensive, you could buy a 7900XTX for cheaper and get around the same performance, and those who have that much money to spend on a video card will just get the 4090 instead because they likely have enough to buy that anyways.\n\n4070 Ti is too expensive and won't be enough to play at 4K with higher texture quality settings due to the 12GB of VRAM. For 4K gaming the 7900XT with 20GB is a far better buy as it has the VRAM to last far longer at that resolution, and even for 1440p gaming you could just get the regular 4070 and have a good experience with the AV1 encoder and DLSS3.\n\n4060 Ti is a joke in every way.\n\nI know people are gonna point out how I own a 4070 Ti and that i'm a hypocrite.\n\nAdmittedly I have a bit of buyer's remorse, and if I knew the 4070 would be so inexpensive compared to the Ti model I would've waited and bought one. I love my 4070 Ti and all, but it's not worth a $200 premium over the regular 4070. But the thing is, I wasn't sure if the 4070 would be any good or not back then, and I doubt most people did either. For all i'd know it could've had 8GB of VRAM, and/or be slower than a 3070 Ti (which it wasn't). But i'm happy with my card even though it's not good value. All I need now is a CPU upgrade, maybe just get a 10900 because I don't want to swap motherboards.",

How much of a market can there be for people who are playing at 1080p right now, but would spend $300-$400 to STAY at 1080p and just get better fps? Even if that market did exist, why on earth would you buy one of these new cards rather than buying a used 1080ti or something like that for less money and as good or better performance? I just don't get it.",

Everytime I see LTT review CSGO playing against bots I cringe so hard. I will never trust anything they say because they obviously don't play games.",
      "Launching at same time with same memory buffer, and honestly, price-performance ratio is actually not too far apart.\n\n4060ti is 30-40% faster and has some extra features, for 50% more money. It really does come to a fairly similar value in the end.",
      ">I love my 4070 Ti and all, but it's not worth a $200 premium over the regular 4070.\n\nBe glad the price difference is only $200 because here in Finland the price difference is 300-400€, which is ridiculous",

When the 1060 launched, was it able to play everything on high in the current games? \n\nI'm not saying that top tier cards prices arent outrageously overpriced, but I remember when I got a 970 not everything was playable at 1080 in max settings for example. \n\nDo I just have a wrong memory of this? These cards can both deliver well over 60fps in all current and demanding titles at 1080p and a lot of titles with 1440p",

Some games can really suffer from the 8gb not all though. The 7600xt and 3060 12gb are about the same speed, the 3060 has the benefit of dlss. The 7600xt 16gb seems nice but it's not really fast enough to play games in a scenario where you would need it. \n\nTldr: I would get the 6750xt if you can still find it for a good price.",

      "In that forget Nvidia. The 760pxt will play 1080p very well and do ok in 1440p compared to the 6750xt, that does very well 1440p and has great p2p",
      "Picked up the 6750xt during the holidays. With a 7600x3d, it dominates at 1080 ultra on everything. Space Marine was the toughest title so far,  with average FPS in 70, with dips into mid 50's. Tried it at 4k with Space Marine, and managed an average 60 on low and medium settings with quality upscaling. Most other titles are 100+ fps ultra at 1080.\n\nNot telling you to trust my feedback alone, but I debated my options at length during the building process, just check my post history. The 6750 XT smokes the rest of your options if NVIDIA luxuries are not needed. I purchased at $320, and given the market at the time, it was evenly priced with the rest. I don't know how prices have fluctuated, but be aware that the 7700 XT has come down to $350, and if it's within your budget, you should pick that up instead, if the price difference isn't significant.",

If you can manage to get a B580 I highly recommend it, good VRAM for the price, good raster performance, good RT performance (unlike the AMD offerings), usable upscaling, and I've heard that frame generation is also okay if it is implemented. Even if XeSS is not supported you can fall back to FSR like the older non-RDNA4 cards",

The 7600xt seems decent but I wouldn't be sure if it'll perform well in 1440p considering the low memory bandwidth. \n\nRemember, its not about FPS, its about the frametimes. the 4060 suffers from sheer stuttering. \n\nAs a 3060 user I am doomed for the theoretical 2 years or so (depending if prices will go down). I'm stuck with this card and there is no other option unless we're selling my internal organs.

RT is hit and miss and Frame Gen can cause performance regressions when you run out of VRAM.\n\nPersonally if DLSS / RT / Frame Gen are important factors the lowest priced card worth buying is the 4060Ti 16GB. You can run stuff like Ratchet & clank at 1080p RT on at 60 + fps (unlike the 8GB model which drops way below 60 with horrible lows) and you won't have to turn textures down in future titles so you can maintain a more stable frame rate and higher IQ for a lot longer.\n\nIf you want a cheap stop gap card then the 6600 is the way to go IMO and then you hope RDNA 4 / Blackwell offer a reasonable perf/$ uplift at the low end while bumping up VRAM a bit to avoid the issues 8GB cards currently have and will continue to have going forward.",

      "Most don't have huge vram impact, mainly textures, FG, and RT. And lowering textures makes everything look like cheeks while also having 0 impact on FPS unlike other settings (as long as you have enough VRAM).\n\nSounds great to buy a brand new GPU and hit the ground running by then dropping textures to 144p. Especially great advice for someone who kept their last GPU for 8 years. Will you even download the texture pack in 2032? Or just delete it?",
      "7600 XT, due to the 16 GB VRAM, but sure. I wouldn't recommend 7600 non XT in 2024.",
      "Yep. Blows my mind as a hobby we've forgotten the very old adage - Ultra settings are placebo and you'd be mad to base your whole life and soul (and benchmark) around those almost universally insane and unrealistic settings, unless you have a fetish for photo mode or something. \n\n\nSwitch games to High or even Medium and you'll have almost the same visuals for a vastly faster (say that three times fast) frame rate. \n\n\n(And cos nowadays we all play at being closest academic markers who need citations, look at the mountain of Digital Foundry videos comparing the different quality modes and the frame rate and visual impact thereof to see that, aside from maybe pop in which even happens on Ultra settings these days anyway, there's bugger all difference between High and Ultra, even Medium, and certainly not noticeable if you're actually playing the fecking game). \n\n\nSo yeah. Switched to High settings the 7600(XT) suddenly is well above the magical 60fps barrier and with the ram looks like a good long term bet. That and the underutilized, for now, AI cores, which I do think will be used by a future FSR variant, and all the weird posturing and dismissals by YouTubers, and forum posters will be quietly forgotten in a years time I predict...\n\n\nAlso forgotten by all these supposed professional reviewers is - in High mode, and some of the more recent games in the last couple of years, the 7600 is within a hairs breadth of the 6700xt which is exactly where it sits in relation to their sales price, so the recommendation to just buy that instead isn't as much a better value for money proposition so much as it is bang on the upgrade. (Having said that in older games yes it is a larger jump. Again though for someone like me so wanted a card that could work with a smaller PSU, have 16GB, and potentially have some of that sweet sweet AI core action, and not living in the US, the 7600XT isn't some horrific purchase.",
      "The 7600 is 298€ in my country vs the 4060 for 312€. I've been meaning to pick one of those since my 1060 is dying, but can't really decide. You think the 4060 is better, or should i go for the 7600?",
      "If you want to keep a card as long as your 1060 has lasted no 8GB card will do it and I personally think the 3060 12GB is a little too weak. Options are basically 7600XT / 6700XT depending on price in your region or you spend a bit more a jump to the 4060 Ti 16GB / RX 6800 depending on if RT / DLSS are important to you or if pure raster performance matters more. For a stint as long as the 1060 I think DLSS / RT / Frame Gen may be more beneficial than a bit more pure raster performance but that is your call to make really.",
      "I wasn't looking too much at vram since i don't play graphically intensive games, mostly indie and competitive shooters. The 6700xt is within my budget but since i will be keeping a new card for at least 5 years i wasn't sure if buying a one that's already 3 years old was a good idea. Guess i'll think about it some more.",
      "you should always use upscaling with RT at every resolution, and dlss is fine at 1080p. Not quite as good as native but 30% faster is still an objectively reasonable tradeoff to make, and it’s not the same thing at all as fsr completely losing it at 1080p.\n\nif you would consider the tradeoff of FSR 2.x acceptable at 4k, in terms of visual quality loss - that's probably roughly where DLSS quality is at 1080p.  But people seem to think the latter is an unacceptable tradeoff while loving the former.",
      "10%, sometimes, right now, doesn't mean a whole lot when it will last longer in time due to VRAM and better driver/features support.",
      "7600XT isn't worth the $80 premium it currently sits at ($250 vs $330), there's also still a 6700XT you can get for $330, in either case the 7600XT makes absolutely no sense.",
      "> can also do RT at 1080p \n\nHow will you do RT with 8 gigs of vram, lol? The real answer is get neither. Either wait or get a 3060, 6700 xt, or 6800. 8 gigs of vram is beyond cheeks now let alone in 2032.",
      "You could get the 4060. Mainly because it sounds like you are a fairly casual user and the 4060 has very low power consumption compared to the 6700 xt. A quieter card and less hot card is less issues to deal with.\n\nThe 6700xt is overall faster and better and should have an easier time running games down the line.\n\nCheck out this video that directly compares the 4060 to the 6700xt. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI0GS0IBMoI"

Not like you would.be buying a 4090 and running on a PCIE 2.0 platform anyway but it shows in gaming that PCIE bandwidth isn't much of a limiting factor.\n\nAnd before people are claiming that it matters when your VRAM limited, sure it would, but you wouldn't be getting acceptable performance at the settings that would fill up VRAM and force constant swapping. You would already be tuning down settings anyway.",

This card in the 200-300 dollar range is very tempting but I'm not sure if my cpu can keep it fed so that's why I'm also considering a cpu upgrade as well",
      "The RX 7600 has only 8 PCIe lanes. Since your CPU (and likely also the mainboard) only does PCIe 3.0, you will have a bottleneck there and maybe see stuttering when the bandwidth isn't enough.\nAn ARc 750 or RTX 3060 wouldn't have that problem.\nBut also, the 2400G will probably be the limiting factor for any of these cards.",

      "It was nowhere near 15% faster when it launched it was closer to 8%. Drivers have significantly improved it since then but at the time it launched no one knew that would happen so the 2060 Super was a solid competitor.",
      "There was literally a slide about that there.\n\n7600 ran mostly at same performance on PCI-E 3 and 4, except losing few percent in Horizon Zero Dawn.",
      "Knowing AMD price trend, it's probably going to be $200 a few months down the road. So I guess there's a positive thing about it...",
      "The problem i see here is that all cards were tested on a modern PCIe4 system. I i had a RX 480/GTX 970 and would be looking for an upgrade, the RX 7600 would perform worse than expected due to having only 8 PCIe3 lanes available.",
      "It won’t be because that market is already saturated. Anyone that wanted that level of performance for that amount of money already bought one of the 2 cards you mentioned. But I definitely see this card as great value once it drops to sub $250 in a few months, just in time for the old gpu stock to dry up",
      "It is a great card it is just getting shadowed by the 330$ 6700xt you can get in the us",
      "Because 1 the cheapest 6800 is $475, and 2 that’s in a completely different price bracket. Now you would have a great point if you said I can buy a 6700 for $280, why would I buy this.",

      "Well it used to be that we were seeing generational improvements. Let's use Nvidia as an example because before the 6000 series AMD didn't really have any high end card offerings for a long time. The 1060 was on par with the 980, the 2060 was comparable to the 1080, the 3060 was close to the 2080. But now suddenly we should be happy if a card is more than 5% better than its last gen version or that it can barely match a card from last gen positioned just above it?",

Only AMD should be forced to beat a 700 class with an entry level new Gen. \n\nNo, the general rule is that the previous generations 'next level' card should be around the same as the new generations card, for example a 3070 should perform as good as a 2080, the 2070 should perform as good as a 1080, the 2060 as good as the 1070, etc etc. Both the 4060TI and the 7600 fail this, which is why people are upset over the stagnation of value. \n\nHowever reviews are primarily looking at it versus the equivalent last gen to highlight the lack of performance increase. \n\n>Meanwhile Nvidia happily throws a 4060Ti on the market which costs more than a 3060Ti an loses against it. AGAINST ists own fuckin counterpart from last Gen, it doesnt even reach ANYWHERE close to the 3070,yet gets sold at close to 500 fuckin dollars. \n\nThe [4060ti](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-founders-edition/34.html) performs 12-6% better than the 3060ti in raster and 20-15% better in RT.  \n\nThe 4060ti performs 100-90% the raster performance of the 3070 and the same in RT. \n\nIt's MSRP is 400 dollars. You can buy a 400 dollar Gigabyte 4060Ti right now, on B&H. \n\nLiterarily everything in that paragraph, except for the 4060TI being more expensive than the 3060TI (which they both had the same MSRP, just the 3060TI is discounted cuz last gen) is wrong. \n\n>Meanwhile 7600 beats the 6650XT, evens out against the 6700, while using less power and bringing a better encoder, RT performance and raster. ShOuLD bE a 199 dolLaR caard!!!!!! \n\nThe 7600 performs essentially the same as the 6650xt in raster, and 100-90% the RT performance of the 6650xt. \n\nTechpowerup found 15% better efficiency in CB, Techspot/HWUB found no real improvements to efficiency.  \n\nIt should definitely be priced, at least the same, as the 6650xt to see a gain in perf/dollar vs last gen. Problem is that I can go get a 6650xt for 250 bucks at amazon, right now. So if I buy a 7600 for 270 dollars right now, I would essentially be paying \\~10% more for a better encoder, and in some cases worse performance than if I went for the 6650xt. Even worse, I can get a 6700 for 280 bucks, 10 dollars more, with an extra 2GB of VRAM.  \n\n> Laughable how paid off this shit actually is. Just watch the end notes of the 4060Ti reviews and then 7600. OMG AMD TERRIBLE!!!!! Meanwhile Nvidia gets a slight slap on the wrist from them. \n\nNope. The 4060TI got flamed as well. \n\nThe fact that this comment is getting upvoted despite having so much info just completely wrong is beyond me, and just goes to show how when people act like AMD is the scapegoat of the PC gaming community, even when it isn't, people go out of their way to updoot and agree, while ignoring the rest of the comment, which has information that is just factually incorrect.",
      "you know you can get 6700 performance for 300 buying a 6700 right?",
      "Nah. I live in Taiwan and the prices for most of AMD 6000 GPUs just wouldn’t drop. Thus the 7600 actually kind of make sense here. It has been long that we got a decent GPU priced under 9000 NTD.",
      "The 2080 was right between the 3060 and 3060TI. The 3070 was competing with the 2080TI",
      "Not sure in Brazil but the previous generation 6700XT can be gotten for the same price as a 7600 and performs better (50% bigger bit bus and VRAM as well).",
      "This. Everyone keeps repeating just buy the 6700 non-xt instead. I can't even find one here and I can buy from 3 countries thru friends and relatives lol and the rest of the 6000 series' prices aren't dropping either.",
      "Are you comparing pricing to current 6650xt pricing? Cause it’s cheaper than the original 6600 isn’t it?",
      "Don't compare it to the 6600 but to the 6600 XT, which is the predecessor. Same performance, same price (or worse), same power consumption. Essentially a rebadge.\n\nThe naming is artificially shifted from 7600 XT to 7600 to make it look like a bigger jump.",
      "Because there is little to none generational improvement, which to be fair the 7600 should be more directly compared to the 6600 not the 6600 xt, 6650xt. Naming scheme aside the performance should be better especially when there's plenty of last gen stock around that preform the same if not better for a better price",
      "WTF are u talking about?  \n6650XT has the same specs with 7600 and we should compare it to weaker 6600? Only because AMD called it 7600 without XT and lowered price?  \n\n\n7600 is 6650XT on 6nm with better RT cores - this is only difference",
      "Then it's a relatively good product for Brazil. That doesn't change the fact that it's a bad/mediocre product in places where 6700xts can be found for around $300.",
      "The cheapest RX 6700 actually costs [340€](https://www.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/10GB-XFX-Radeon-RX-6700-Speedster-SWFT-309-Core-Gaming-GDDR6_1477805.html) in Europe, while the RX 7600 \"only\" costs 300€. But the 6700 is discontinued, so there are not many left. That's by far the cheapest RX 6700, other sellers charge 370€ which is the same price as the RX 6700 XT.\n\nBut the RX 7600 is in the reviews often closer to the [RX 6650XT](https://webshop.asus.com/de/90YV0HS2-M0NA00/ASUS-Dual-Radeon-RX-6650-XT-V2-OC-Edition-8GB-GDDR6-Gaming-Grafikkarte) which only costs 250€.

It's too expensive for what it actually can do.\n\nAnd i don't see why anyone is even trying to defend a card that has so much trouble beating the XT variant of the last gen. It's not FX-level horrible, but it's far from being good or even just ok.",

It would also depend on what NVIDIA does with the former 4080 12GB and how Navi 32 compares to it in performance.\n\nNavi 33 might be 6700 XT or 6600 XT, or both.\n\nFor release dates, I'd guess that AMD will tease Navi 32 at CES and provide more details later in Q1.\n\nMy feeling is that AMD has an incentive to have a shorter release cycle with this generation, both because it can beat NVIDIA in value and because Navi 33 will be a better use of the 6/7nm production lines than RDNA 2.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say that Navi 33 has been rumoured to be mobile first, and this makes some sense.

The last decade's top end is now the price of this decades previous grn top end. Which is horrible.\n\nOn the other hand, as a content creator, I can get so much more out of consumer based cards today, the premium is well worth it.\n\n Also, as long as your card has a significant amount of RAM, today's mid to top end cards should last a lot longer.

High end demand never really seems to stop as people with disposable income keep coming back for more despite market conditions."

      "Can I politely ask all these rumours to shut up?\n\nIt's getting announced at Computex. That's in one week or so.\n\nIf they're right, AMD can shove it. If not, stop baiting and wait and see.",
      "Yeah, they're intolerable. If you're also into football (the European one), then every other year you get a confluence of PC hardware rumours and transfer rumours. Kills the internet dead.",
      "For sure, saying \"the new version is more expensive than the current market value of the old one\" is a given. That's literally how retail works.",
      "Rumorers never shut up. \"Hey did you guys know the 4070 TI is a rebadged 4080 12...\"\n\n\"YES, WE KNOW. YOU TOLD US 20 TIMES\"",
      "A $300 price for the 7600 also bumps it up against the 6700 XT and one can be found on Newegg for $320 as I type.  How will its performance compare to the 6700 XT?  What happens if 6700 XT's drop further in price?",
      "It's going to be interesting to see how the RT performance of the 7000 drops off below the 7900 cards. It's possible that they'll offer a meaningful improvement on the 6000 the whole way down the stack. Otherwise, it's hard to see why someone wouldn't just get a 6700XT",
      "> A pair of listings on PC-Canada has revealed the price of AMD's upcoming RX 7600 in Canada. One of the listings features a Sapphire Pulse RX 7600 for $451.99 CAD, and the other is $443.99 CAD for an MSI RX 7600 Mech 2x Classic. After converting to USD and factoring in any potential \"early adopter tax,\" we end up with approximate prices of around $299 USD. That's technically less than the launch price of AMD's RX 6600, and well below the RX 6650 XT's $399 MSRP, though these days the various RX 66xx-class GPUs tend to sell far below their launch prices.",
      "A real informative headline would have simply said \"RX 7600 expected to cost $299\". The article would have discussed the source of the price speculation and the reasoning, and compared it to MSRPs and current street prices.\n\nWhich is largely what the article did, it just framed it in \"this chip doesn't seem worth the price\", which is just another bunch of speculations thrown over the price ones.",
      "> And that \"companies are not your friends\"\n\nThat's because yeah, companies are not your friends.",
      "Swear to Christ people are angrier at AMD for not selling a GPU for the price of a McChicken than they are at Nvidia for raising prices.\n\nThis card is cheaper than its predecessor, last gen GPU's have been marked down to even cheaper than that within the past few weeks, this cards main competition is pathetic (4050 6GB of RAM), and people still find some reason to bitch and want the price to be lower.",
      "leaked out of his ass",
      "If only social media extended that same courtesy to Nvidia.\n\nOver the last few months we had some really cool rumors taken at face value, examples:\n\nWhen someone said that RTX 4070ti would launch at $1000 MSRP (increased from $900 after rebadging the 4080 12GB). Ended up being completely false.\n\nWhen someone said that 4070 was $750 ($50 below the $800 MSRP of 4070ti). Ended up being completely false.\n\nYou can still find thousands of angry comments in Reddit threads discussing these rumors.",
      "There has been a general meme trend that AMD is out to gouge consumers by raising their hardware costs, and I fully expect more articles to lean into that overly cynical mindspace\n\nOften when people on the r/amd reddit talk about it, that I have seen, it seems to come out~\n\n that they also expect AMD is currently, or would have, taken all of the anti-competitive actions against their competitors, like that Nvidia and Intel have done time and again.\n\nAnd that \"companies are not your friends\" to the extent that historical pro-consumer actions on AMDs part should be ignored, cause reasons\n\nAnd they get mashed together in various ways to claim that AMD is screwing us, or has been, or would have been if only they could have been\n\nReally, it is just confusing.",
      "Urgh, there's more than one football? Haven't we suffered enough?",
      "Yes and no? If you bench 6950 XT vs 7900 XT in 1440p and 4K, the difference in raster between them is significantly smaller than the difference in RT. Like say if performance difference in raster is 20% in a completely GPU bound scenario, RT will be 40-60%.",
      "Thanks for sharing that. It had big \"The Onion\" energy, and it actually surprises me how keenly they skewered the tactic by showing an example of it right in the article.\n\nThat said, I don't understand people who hate click on things. If I see clickbait, I move along. And if it's in a feed I have control over, I permanently block the source the first time and make sure only to read from places that don't use clickbait titles.\n\nI honestly think that eventually, people catch on and that clickbait's a short term strategy that fails in the long run however.",
      "Wow, so a newer and faster card is more expensive than the *current market value* of the last gen card?\n\nI'm shocked, utterly shocked. Wait until they find about clearance TV pricing...",
      "Seeing that this GPU is essentially the same as a 6650XT, except with dual issue SIMD, thats pretty sad.",
      "That's twice the cost of this class of card, and it would likely require a larger PSU for many people considering this card and most of them probably don't even have 4k monitors.  \n\nThis card is for people building a whole computer for $650, not just graphics card.",
      "Not everyone is into playing the latest AAA titles. Some people will be fine with 8gb for a few years at least. Although a bit extra vram wouldn't hurt."

RS-630\n   * AFMF  improves performance by adding frame generation technology to AMD  Radeon™ 700M, RX 6000, and RX 7000 series GPUs for notebook and desktop  platforms. \t\t\n      * Up to 97% average increase in performance across select titles  at 1080p resolution when AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) is ON and  upscaled with FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2) at Quality Mode,  using AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition™️ 24.1.1 on the Radeon™ RX 7600XT  GPU, versus when AFMF and FSR 2 upscaling are OFF. RS-630\n      * Up to 103% average increase in performance across select titles  at 1440p resolution when AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) is ON and  upscaled with FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2) at Quality Mode,  using AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition™️ 24.1.1 on the Radeon™ RX 7600XT  GPU, versus when AFMF and FSR 2 upscaling are OFF. RS-631\n   * AFMF preserves image quality by dynamically disabling frame generation during fast visual motion.\n* **AMD Video Upscaling** – Advanced video upscale algorithm to improve video playback image quality for AMD Radeon™ RX 7000 desktop series GPUs. \t\n   * AMD Video Upscaling can be enabled within the Graphics tab to  enjoy improved sharpness and clarity, for DirectX 11 applications such  as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Media Player, with resolution  support up to 4K.\n   * For more instructions on how to enable upscaling, please ensure that your version of AMD Software is up to date, and learn more [**HERE**](https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/amd-software-24-1-1-amd-fluid-motion-frames-an-updated-ui-and/ba-p/656213)!\n* **Additional Video Improvements** \n   * Content Adaptive Machine Learning (CAML) text detection has been updated to support up to 4K gaming for even greater clarity.\n   * Various encoding support within AMD Software including AVC, HEVC  and AV1 codecs have undergone additional optimizations to improve video  encode quality.\n   * AMD continues to work with partners to implement video enhancements into 3rd party apps; more updates to follow in upcoming drivers.\n* **AMD Smart Technology Tab** – Access the suite of great A+A features from one convenient location to maximize the power of your AMD-powered system.\n* **AMD Assistant** – Automatically enable or disable AMD Software features based on various situations for improved performance or battery life.\n* **Additional OS Feature Support** \n   * Support for Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling has been  expanded to Radeon™ RX 7600 series GPUs on Windows 11 version 22H2 and  newer. Click [HERE](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/hardware-accelerated-gpu-scheduling/) for more information.\n\n## What to Know\n\n* **AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF)** \n   * AFMF can be enabled for **any** DirectX® 11 and 12 title using HYPR-RX.  \t\t\n      * AFMF may introduce additional latency to games and may not  offer the optimal experience for fast-paced competitive titles. AFMF is  recommended to be combined with AMD Radeon™ Anti-Lag to reduce in-game  latency while maintaining a minimum in-game fps of 60.\n      * Due to the potential latency impact of AFMF, it must be manually  enabled in the per-game settings for certain fast-paced competitive  titles, even if AFMF was already enabled globally. Gamers are free to  enable AFMF in these titles based on their preference and gameplay  style, however, they may not experience optimal performance –  specifically at lower frame rates.\n      * AFMF may be enabled or disabled on the fly using the default hotkey of Alt-Shift-G.\n   * AFMF currently requires the game to be played in fullscreen mode with VSYNC disabled. \t\t\n      * For better compatibility with borderless-fullscreen titles, Windows 11 users can enable [\"Optimizations for windowed games\"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/optimizations-for-windowed-games-in-windows-11-3f006843-2c7e-4ed0-9a5e-f9389e535952).\n      * For a better visual experience, AFMF is recommended to be used with variable refresh rate enabled.\n   * Users can check AFMF’s frame generation status using AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition™’s in-game overlay.\n   * AFMF adds frame generation technology to boost FPS outside the  game’s engine. Users can use AMD Software Performance Metrics Overlay to  see the resulting FPS. \t\t\n      * Support for third-party performance monitoring tools is not available at this moment.\n   * For systems setup using Hybrid Graphics (such as laptops featuring  an integrated and discrete GPU), AFMF must be supported on the  displaying GPU to be activated.\n   * Stay tuned for future enhancements and innovations coming to  HYPR-RX with AFMF, focusing on elevating image quality, smoothness, and  latency. Enjoy gaming with HYPR-RX.\n   * **AMD Video Upscaling** \n   * AMD Video Upscaling can be enabled for most DirectX 11  applications to improve image quality. However, certain applications  such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge may require an additional step  to activate AMD Video Upscaling. \t\t\n      * For Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, 'Media Foundation for  Clear' must be enabled. This setting can be configured in the browser  settings accessed through chrome://flags/ or edge://flags/.\n   * Users have the flexibility to adjust the level of sharpness added  by AMD Video Upscaling using the slider located within the Graphics tab.\n* **AMD Technical Preview Driver** \n   * Users had the opportunity to get an early look of AFMF through  the AMD Technical Preview Drivers and provide their feedback to build  and refine the feature. The feedback received through our online  communities and [AMD Bug Report Tool](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/amdbrt) helped create a more stable experience for AFMF in AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 24.1.1. \n   * Users looking for updates of future AMD Technical Preview Drivers can subscribe to our newsletter [HERE](https://www.amd.com/en/forms/sign-up/gaming-software-news.html).\n\n## Fixed Issues\n\n* Performance drop may be observed in some DirectML workloads.\n* Intermittent grey screen after driver upgrade with certain monitors (such as Nixeus NX-EDG274K) on Radeon™ RX 7000 series GPUs.\n* Graphics API metric may show as N/A in certain UWP applications.\n* Heavy stuttering may be experienced while playing Warframe and loading into a new area or starting a mission.\n* Black artifacts may be observed in smoke effects while playing Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III.\n* Black texture flickering may be observed while playing Starfield on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 5600 XT.\n* Intermittent install failure may be observed when using the factory reset setting.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n* Deathloop may experience extended loading times on some AMD  Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 6900 XT. \\[Resolution targeted  for 24.2.1\\]\n* Dead Space may experience an application crash after enabling RTAO on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 6800.\n* Excessive stuttering may be experienced when first playing a match in Overwatch 2. \\[Resolution targeted for 24.2.1\\]\n* Audio may intermittently become out of sync with the video when  recording from AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition using AV1 codec.  \\[Resolution targeted for Q2\\]\n* Oculus Rift S may display with a green tint on AMD Radeon™ RX 7000 series GPUs.\n* After a system reboot, Parsec host application may experience a  crash on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX.  \\[Resolution targeted for 24.2.1\\]\n* During Microsoft Teams meetings, the camera may intermittently  display looped footage on some AMD Products, such as the AMD Ryzen™ 7  7840U Processor.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n* For users that game remotely with AMD Link, one important  announcement is that AMD is ending support for the AMD Link software. We  originally launched AMD Link at a time when there were few alternative  remote gaming solutions for Radeon graphics users. Today, there are many  options available for users to stream their PC content to other  devices. AMD’s role is to enable and support developers, not compete  with them. As such, we are ending support for AMD Link and focusing our  resources on other core capabilities and features that benefit users. We  will also continue to support developers with our SDKs such as the [AMD Advanced Media Framework](https://gpuopen.com/advanced-media-framework/) that allow them to enable streaming functionality within their solutions.\n* For users who previously installed an AMD Software preview driver,  running AMD Cleanup Utility is recommended before installing this  driver.\n* AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 24.1.1 will now automatically clear  previously installed drivers located in the C:\\\\AMD folder to save  space.\n\n# ",

I would say 350 € is my upper limit. I don't really care that much for a 25 € difference. If it turns into a more than 50€ difference I'm probably going with the B580.\n\nI don't game that much because I don't have the time, but I like to have a PC that allows me to play with good graphics when I have the chance.

Probably just crappy drivers. SMH why can’t radeon just work around my unstable hardware like nvidia does? \n\nObvious sarcasm aside, if you’re getting BSODs it’s not a driver issue and more than likely a hardware instability issue. I haven’t seen a driver caused BSOD in a long time and not even on the dedicated help for AMD drivers subreddit.",

      "This probably isn't really news.\n\nAMD used use a similar configuration for the 6650/6600 XT as the RX 7600, so this is likely a vestige of AMD planning to call the RX 7600 the RX 7600 XT. And since RX 7600 still falls behind the RTX 4060, it's understandable why AMD made that choice.",

In fullscreen, every time you select something the UI totally freezes and only adjusts to what was selected if you alt tab out and back in. After you alt tab you can move the cursor around as expected, but the moment you select something you get a frozen image. This problem persists into matches - everything is frozen and won't update unless you alt tab out. God of War and GTA V also had arc-like problems with flickering and hitching in the settings menu.\n\nRocket League's the game that the 7600 won't utilise fully in with a triple monitor config. It literally won't break 70% utilisation. Single and dual works fine.\n\nI admit I don't know why the issue with safe mode  happens (it also happens in bios). It might be on Elgato in all fairness, but I can't say. The only other card I have that will automatically output to the 4k60 in safe mode and bios is the ARC A770. No other card does it.",

AMD removed support for the RX7600 in their latest driver build 23.5.2 or whatever the numbers go up.\n\n\nAnd it is no joke, Everyone with an RX7600 have the same crashes. Its such a low quantity card AMD just immidiately abandoned it. Mindfactory has sold 30-40 of them since launch. All retailers in Sweden have combined shipped less than 20 since launch.\n\n\nThese issues happen with all AMD cards but the memory limitations of the 7600 makes the driver memory leak far exceed the cards capacity which crashes or freezes the system.

Flickering settings menus, performance that tanks unexpectedly, an issue where GPU utilisation won't max out under load when you have more than two monitors connected, and even an issue where if you boot into safe mode with a capture card connected then the card will only output an image to the capture card. Even AMDs own hardware recognition tool (for redeeming 'free' games) won't register that there's a 7600 in my system.\n\nThe 7600's drivers needed a lot longer in the oven.

There's a chance they'll take a hint from tech outlets like HUB and MLID and go for a sensible price, but since the 6000 series ended up being good value and selling well (which was precisely because they lowered prices but not sure they realized it) they might opt for the same strat this gen and launch at bad prices again, which would only leave a bad taste in consumers' mouths, just like you said.\n\nEven if the chance is slim, I'm praying for them to be smart about pricing and not fuck up."

The manufacturing tolerances are now the providence of very difficult physics and bleeding-edge facilities.

Even after binning, each CPU is going to be a bit picky, doubly so for those that are multiple pieces of silicon packaged together into one final product.  \n\nI think it's just a lesson for us not that companies have changed any more than they were over the previous half decade, but that if you get a CPU that simply can't be made to hit numbers that make sense... it's up to you if you wish to return it, try changing coolers, getting a different SKU, etc.  \n\nThere's no shame in doing a return of an individual product you're not feeling good about.

      ">I'm just glad to see that PC gaming isn't quite the boy's club it used to be\n\nI think you are arguing a strawman that never happened in the first place.  The \"boys club\" bit by some overzealous terminally online moral busybodies is an overused cliche used by people who haven't been paying attention to gaming for the past 10 years.\n\nI've literally *never* heard of a conversation where a guy teased a girl for making a computer \"girly\".  In fact, Yeston coming out with those off the wall designs were actually a breath of fresh air to everyone.  It's not because of some ideological premise of wanting PC gaming to have some population equity between the sexes (and there's a high chance it never will), but because the designs were out of the box and unique.\n\nSomeone at marketing at all these AIBs and NVIDIA/AMD themselves thought the overused ultra dark \"edgy\" militaristic/future designs was what everyone wanted.  The only problem is *all* the manufacturers thought this was the case, which led to everything looking samey from a design standpoint.\n\nYeston flipped that market upside down and reminded people that there are different demographics with different interests who would love to see a GPU that isn't just marketed towards the xXxSTEALTHNINJAASSASSINxXx COD crowd.  Japan, for example, actually has occasional Japan-only PC hardware releases that feature all kinds of anime-style designs/promotions.\n\nThe fact it took a company not many of us in the West have heard of to finally turn back the clock on overly edgy GPU designs was a long time coming.  And it's not like the brand itself is a newcomer, its parent company, Shenzhen Yingjiaxun Industrial Limited, has been in the Chinese IT industry since 2000.  Yeston was founded as a sub-brand of the company in the same year, but I guess they finally started making inroads when people started noticing their GPU and case designs.\n\nI am just making an educated guess here, but I'm thinking Yeston was the sub-brand that was given creative freedom to make off-the-wall components designs, and a designer or engineer at Yeston probably thought several years back making graphics cards that move away from the COD player demo might actually be worth taking a shot at.  There were already some older cards that hinted at this move away - I've seen pictures of a GT 730 and an RTX 550, for example, that were in a garish magenta color.  They still sold edgy \"gamer\" cards even back then alongside these weird designs.\n\nSapphire taking cues from Yeston to go nuts with their designs is a very good sign because it's indicating the market is getting tired of the GAMER (tm) aesthetic and AIBs are noticing it as well.",

HUB has brainwashed a legion of users into thinking RT is unusable on low end cards and that DLSS is terrible at 1080p when neither can be further from the truth. A bit of clever settings tweaks and you can get a decent experience with RT enabled even on these cards. And by these cards I mean Nvidia cards because it is unusable on AMD but maybe that's why HUB is trying so hard to invalidate the feature entirely.",
      "I do like their new benchmarking format with the stronger RT showing. Hope they keep this for the 7800/7700 reviews.\n\nKind of odd that AMD prices have actually gone up in the last few weeks. A week after launch you could get multiple 7600 for $250 I think, but now many of those are $10 to $20 higher again. Better just to wait for a 4060 to go on sale for $280-290.",
      "It is sad that while the 4060 is 15-18% faster than the 3060 (which is not nothing, I mean, the 4060Ti is just 5% faster than the 3060Ti), so there is a performance uplift to be had, the VRAM capacity cut down to 2/3 definitely hurts it. The 4060 is quite faster, but once you are out of VRAM that becomes irrelevant, it is game over. The 3060 will be a relevant card for longer than the 4060, even though it is slower and two years older.  \n\n\nFor the 7600 there is nothing to be said. It is for all practical purposes a rebranded 6600XT/6650XT. Ever so slightly faster. An embarrassing product.  \n\n\nStill, if I were to recommend any card between these two, I would say skip both. Get either the 6600XT/6650XT (especially if you want Starfield) which are still available and cheaper than the 7600, or get the 3060.",

Both of those things may not even be needed/used by the people buying the cards, FSR2 works with any card, FSR3 doesn't exist, RT gains are almost 1:1 with raster improvements, and the 32CU RX 7600 and 32CU RX 6650XT are within 2% of each other. At least with RTX 40 series cards, you can point to DLSS3 or massive efficiency gains even if the price is trash.\n\nStarfield comes out early September, and everyone will want to play it on day 1. A flash sale $300-330 RX 6700XT/6750XT comes with a key to play it, and I don't expect price/performance to improve from there.",

      "Prices went up a couple of days after the Starfield bundle started. AMD has to pay Bethesda/MS for a Starfield license to bundle it. Granted, AMD is paying a FAR lower price than end users, but it's not nothing.\n\nAdding to that, AMD RDNA2 sales likely increased due to the Starfield promotion and the 4060/TI's impotence while supply also decreased, so the prices went up a bit.",
      "The 3060 was also a pretty miserable card to start with being barely faster than a 2060 Super, so for it to still be going for that price is especially sad, 12GB or not.",

Insiders at Nvidia confirm their Starfield drivers are bad/incomplete, citing a lack of funding and reallocation of resources to AI development. (Seems reasonable.)\n3. Per Bethesda insider, Starfield originally used a renderer built on Vulkan API, then switched to DX12 late in development. They partnered with AMD for two reasons: 1) to get help implementing FSR2, and 2) to get help switching from the Vulkan-based renderer to DX12, given AMD's intimate understanding of/contributions to Vulkan (by way of Mantle).\n4. Bethesda didn't have a working version of the game to present to Nvidia and Intel for optimization until late into production. \"A lot of the old Vulkan codebase was there with AMD DLLs that had not been translated yet.\"\n5. AMD insider says \"most of the prelaunch work \\[AMD\\] did on this game was just trying to make it run well on their cards at all\" rather than necessarily optimizing their drivers, hence some lingering issues like the widely-reported stars not rendering.\n6. RTX 4070 has dropped in price to $549 in response to 7800 XT. (Confirmed/corroborated by others as well.)\n7. \"RX 7600 XT 10GB/12GB\" likely not real. Source speculates it could be \"just another example of an AIB staking out a name, or corporate is trying to mess with Nvidia.\"\n8. Intel Twin Lake is a refresh of \"Alder Lake N\" all-E-core CPU, still using Gracemont cores, fabbed on Intel 7 process.\n\n\\---\n\n\\---\n\n\\---\n\nA couple thoughts:\n\n1. Couches dev statements in lots of \"would\" and \"would not\" statements, no \"did\" and \"did not\" ones. In other words, doesn't seem he spoke with many, if any, devs who 1) had AMD-sponsored games, and 2) said definitively whether their contract imposed a ban on competing technologies or not. (That's not to lend the original accusation any undue legitimacy. It's still extremely sus as well, and any self-respecting person should remain highly skeptical, at least in my view of it.)\n2. &#x200B;\n3. Does his own analysis a major disservice when he discusses the Starfield partnership and mischaracterizes the announcement as \"self-described \\[by AMD\\] as a surprise.\" As proof he cites a Digital Trends article that begins, \"AMD has just announced an unexpected “exclusive” partnership with Bethesda and Starfield...\" where it's clear he completely misreads it and twists it to fit the narrative he's building, ie that Bethesda contacted AMD late in development for help with Starfield, and AMD were caught off-guard by the request. There's plenty of decent evidence and analysis otherwise, making that bit wholly unnecessary.\n\nThe rest seem reasonable enough.",

      "Well, in cases like this, a \"control group\" isn't really appropriate. What would a control group look like? Games that have both technologies? AMD-sponsored titles that have one? the other? both? neither? Nvidia-sponsored titles? Non-sponsored titles? And so on. There is no real control group. The hypothesis postulated by Wccftech is \"AMD blocks DLSS from its sponsored titles; Nvidia does not block FSR from its sponsored titles.\" So it's fair enough to do a simple observational study and rudimentary statistical analysis; Wccftech were right on that mark.\n\nUnfortunately, as you say, the sample size they drew conclusions from - 20 titles total, 13 AMD-sponsored, 7 Nvidia-sponsored - was simply too small to, well, draw conclusions from. Gamers Nexus, [as part of basic background research for its news summary video that week](https://youtu.be/w_eScXZiyY4?si=Y9wCRJyQidHmNGvo&t=320), managed to find ***29*** AMD-sponsored titles (123% more than Wccftech managed), of which 14 were FSR-only. They also found [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/14f2nlw/comment/joy38sp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with a more general analysis of all games that have some form of image reconstruction tech. From that data, it's impossible to say with any great deal of certainty that any vendor is/was doing any amount of blocking of any technology.\n\nRegarding AMD's \"No comment\" response to GN...\n\n\\- Given the specificity of GN's question (\"Does the contract between AMD and Bethesda have any language which intentionally blocks ***or could be construed as blocking or limiting*** Bethesda's ability to integrate alternative upscaling technologies within Starfield?\" (emphasis mine)), and...\n\n\\- Given what Frank Azor said in a recent The Verge interview (something like \"Yes, we request that partners prioritize our tech, but it's a request, not a demand.\"),\n\n...it's not surprising that AMD would choose not to comment.\n\nOf course, Azor's statement to The Verge could just be a smokescreen and they indeed did have such contractual language in place that they walked back after the backlash... but without a smoking gun pointing to any of that being the case, that suggestion holds about as much water as me suggesting that Lisa Su regularly dices onions super fine for Jensen Huang, who then takes them and massages them into his open eyes for fun.",

Literally the only group I saw treat this with a proper amount of skepticism was Gamers Nexus, who rightly saw too little evidence to give it the time of day. HUB and others gave the accusation a token nod of skepticism, but for the most part treated it as fact, to the point where they were posting whole videos uncritically arguing with AMD fanboys uncritically defending a practice that hadn't even been proven.\n\nIt's a whole ass controversy built on such an obviously *stupid* base.

      ">just \"accidentally\" unanimously decided not to implement DLSS?\n\nDid I say anything about anyone either accidentally or unanimously deciding not to implement DLSS?\n\nBut to your point: The data so far shows you're wrong, which is entirely my point. Your statement - that \"pretty much only the \\[devs\\] paid by amd ... unanimously decided not to implement DLSS\" - only holds true if you trust the small sample size of 20 games provided by Wccftech (13 AMD-sponsored, 7 Nvidia-sponsored). I wrote in another response, you might have seen it, that Gamers Nexus managed to look at 29 AMD-sponsored games - over double the 13 Wccftech did - and found that less than half (14 of 29) were FSR-exclusive. Gamers Nexus were doing little more than the most basic of background research; you would expect Wccftech to have at least been able to find that many.\n\nSo, does \"pretty much half the \\[devs\\] paid by amd ... unanimously decided not to implement DLSS\" sound nearly as nefarious? No, it doesn't.\n\n>DLSS and FSR take roughly the same amount of dev time to implement, DLSS is superior and Nvidia has an 80% market share.\n\nThe way I understand it, implementing either one takes a bit of effort, then substituting the other in is fairly simple. However, implementing is one thing; QAing and testing is another entirely. You have to make sure the menu toggle works correctly. You have to make sure the algorithms switch correctly. You have to make sure the game recognizes which cards can and can't use DLSS and eliminate that option as necessary. And so on and so forth. It might not be a lot of extra work, but it might be enough that you decide to go with the broadest coverage option rather than the one that provides the best picture quality.\n\nAs for \"market share,\" just citing Nvidia's market share is disingenuous when it comes to discussing the use of DLSS. As you know, DLSS requires the use of an RTX GPU, and my rough math using the Aug 2023 Steam hardware survey shows that only 40% - or half of the total 80% Nvidia market share - are RTX GPus. This means, obviously, that 60% of the market can't use DLSS. However, 100% (or close to 100%, anyway) of the market can use FSR2.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say whether AMD did or did not, or does or does not, block DLSS from its sponsored titles. It IS to say that the Wccftech article that launched this whole controversy was poorly-written and poorly-researched, and it should have been dismissed out of hand almost immediately rather than be taken up uncritically as gospel by the gaming community writ large.",

      "If you want to measure FPS when using upscaling then using the same algorithm across the board to keep variables to a minimum is required.\n\nIf you want to measure IQ then you use the best upscaling method available for each GPU/Game combo.\n\nWhen HUB used FSR across the board for a test it was for the former case, they were not testing IQ, they were measuring FPS so were doing it in a way that kept the workload the same across all GPU hardware which is the correct way to do it.\n\nThey also mentioned (and showed in a later video) that DLSS will give even better IQ for broadly the same kind of frame rate increase so where available always use DLSS instead.\n\nIt is a very logical approach to take in the scenario they were using it for."

It says in EU the prices will be 549 es 489 respectively and right now you can still get the 6800 for 459 and 489EUR which seems like a significantly better option than the 7700XT.",

Sure no one with a 6800XT would “upgrade” to a 7800XT, but if they price it exactly at or above what the 6800XT is available at right now, then why did those “new people” wait? \n\nThe answer is they were waiting for 6800XT performance for 6700XT price or less, because that’s the precedent for the past decade or more. Improving energy efficiency and keeping the price the same while shouting “INFLATION!” isn’t good enough to justify these cards’ existence - especially not when RAM chip prices are way down, AMD is building these on a mature previous gen node, and while they’re not breaking record profits, they’re still more than profitable and being down 18-20% from the COVID spike is misleading at best. \n\nIf the XTX had simply been the 7900 XT and everything else got bumped down a tier, this lineup would look great. A 7700XT (current 7800XT) with the performance of a 3080 12GB or 6800 XT for $450? Awesome! Positive momentum and genuine reason to justify a purchase or recommend. \n\nInstead we got the “Biff is King” timeline, but without real hoverboards.",

They e been accumulating the chips for many months, not selling the cards yet to get rid of 6000 series stock, then they play this game to push out more 7800xt stick, then will drop the price of 7700xt in a month or two to sell those 15% yields. Assuming I understood the YouTubers correctly, who spread unverified rumors with nameless sources.",
      "Well, that's because the 4060 is objectively bad value though?",

      "The 7800XT....if the leaked performance is true, you get 4070-level performance (high fps 1440p ultra) for 15-20% cheaper. That's solid value (yes not amazing, but reasonable). 500$ is a price many people can afford for a GPU, and now you can get a solid 1440p experience or even 4K for that price.",
      "Note the RT data is quite skewed towards Cyberpunk. They even included RT overdrive benchmarks for w/e reason which was never meant to run on Radeon lmao... even with Cyberpunk benchmarked **4 times** out of the 9 results, the RDNA3 GPUs are still holding up against their counterpart in RT. If you ignore Cyberpunk overdrive, 7700xt is 1.875% faster than 4060ti on average in RT (with Cyberpunk being benched 3 times). The 7800xt would be 4.375% slower than the 4070 in RT as well.\n\nThat brings me to conclude that the 7700xt is actually decent value vs 4060ti 16 GB on paper even if they are both \\~$450. With the 4060ti, you mainly gain DLSS 2 and 3, which isn't always present in all games (or you can pay for it lol ...), and 4GB more VRAM. The 7700xt has roughly equal RT and 15% better Raster on the other hand.",
      "The main reason that happened was oversupply of last gen stock, so AMD fronted the generational value uplift via discounts, then slotted in these two more or less based on that.\n\nPersonally, even if it makes reviews boring, this strategy is **far** more customer friendly than the typical one. These GPU's are designed, and prototypes are made WAY ahead of time, so selling you reheated leftovers for full price one day and then immediately launching something that makes that price look silly is kind of entrapment...\n\nThey would have came out earlier, but people were incensed that last gen clearance pricing was better value than the 7600 (since last gen is more expensive to make for a given tier of performance so selling through it is top priority).\n\nSo since everyone told AMD that launching the 7600 when they did was an unwinnable situation, they held off releasing these two until last gen products were almost out of stock.",

      "fwiw, the average RT scores (which tbf, are not in the original data, but videocardz's summary) are unfairly biased by cyberpunk being included 4 times in the overall averages (i mean, all these games are cherry picked to a certain degree, but having the worst AMD performing game included multiple times is particularly egregious)   \n  \nIf only RT ultra is included, which seems reasonable since the 4070 only manages 18fps in overdrive, the 7800xt vs  4070 changes to -4.3% in RT, and overall to +3%. \n  \nNot a big practical difference either way - I just don't like seeing averages just being applied blindly!"

But every week that goes by, I see myself close to jumping off from it.   \n\n\nI will give some thoughts and I would be happy to be proven wrong, and that the 7700/7800 are worth the wait, but I am finding it hard to justify. Here we go:  \n\n\n1. The upper tier of RX 6000 cards are being priced very aggressively as of lately. Namely the 6800XT and the 6950XT. Besides, we pretty much know that whatever price/performance ratio the 7700 and 7800 offer at launch, it is unlikely the beat the discounted 6000 cards. The 7600 vs 6600XT/6650XT was a good example of that.  \n\n2. Free Premium Starfield. That is a $100 game being offered with upper tier RX 6000 cards and we can't tell for sure whether it will be offered with the 7700/7800 cards. These cards are unlikely to be released before Starfield is (which is just 7 weeks away). Moreover, 2023 has been an incredible year for gaming - arguably the best year out of the last 5 years, if not longer. Some are suggesting it is the best year for gaming ever. That might be a stretch. Regardless, each month of this year that goes by without a GPU upgrade, well, it kinda sucks.  \n\n3. RDNA3 offers no significant technological improvement over RDNA2, other than a small performance/watt gain. FSR3 will work for both. Memory (a strong selling point for AMD) won't improve either: the 7800/XT will offer the same memory capacity as the 6800/XT.  \n\n4. AMD is not necessarily under pressure.

      "I was considering waiting, but looking their product stack and their pricing, there's literally nothing they could release that would be better then a 4070 for me.\n\nI would pretty much need to get a 7900xt performance wise, but using less power, for the price of a 4070, to want to give up the ray tracing performance, DLSS, cuda, reflex, and other nice Nvidia features. Those features really put in work and I'm tired of getting second class support all in the effort of raster performance. We're well past the point of raster being the only thing that matters, I'd happily give up 10-15% or more of my performance if it meant the card was better in all other aspects, and unfortunately that's the position I'm in with Nvidia and AMD.\n\nThis coming from someone currently on a 5700XT. When I bought that card over a 2070 super, ray tracing and DLSS were jokes. But if I could know how much better they were gonna get in the future I would have happily spent more on the 2070s.\n\nThat, and AMD's pricing here in Canada sucks right now anyways and I couldn't get a 6950XT for anywhere close to the price of a 4070 even if I did want that card, which I don't.",

I'm in a similar boat as OP's except I'm waiting on a bit of money to come in which I will use to make a purchase and I've been crossing my fingers for a 7700xt release. Really didn't want to buy 2+ year old hardware. Sigh",
      "> Really didn't want to buy 2+ year old hardware. Sigh\n\nTheres always pros and cons to buying brand new hardware. 7000 drivers were a mess at launch and it took months to fix them. Meanwhile, 6000 series drivers have been stable for well over a year. Another example, when I got my 5900x and x570 mobo in late 2020 (when 5000 series cpus launched), my ram wouldnt run at the frequency advertised (3600 mhz) without my system crashing like crazy. I had to run it at 3200 for over 6 months until there was a bios update that fixed it. So I ended up losing performance and paid for something I couldnt fully use for 6+ months. New tech is almost always overpriced at and around launch too.\n\nI get the allure of buying the brand new, shiny thing, but is it really that big of a deal to buy 2+ year old hardware? When you go car shopping, do you only look at the 2023 models and ignore everything 2021 and earlier? Even if you get most of the performance/features for a lot less money? What about TVs or monitors? The latest lg c3 is 25% more money than a c2 and has marginal performance increases at best. Most would say it's a waste of money to buy the c3 over the c2. \n\nI just think we need to change our mentality when it comes to these things. You shouldnt feel bad because youre buying something thats a couple years old. Especially when that thing thats a couple years old is priced well and is a big performance increase to whatever youre currently using.",

With the 5800X3D and the 3090 I average over 120 FPS in the same maps. It was a massive improvement. But that game uses the Unity engine and that engine benefits massively from increased cache. Some other game engines do not see as drastic of an improvement. Some others do.\n\nSo it depends on what you play and if you are targeting very high FPS. If you have a mid range GPU I think you probably made the right choice."

And for MCM configurations, the 7700XT is a low-end configuration - too low to see the benefits in cost scaling, but still incurs penalties for performance overhead/power and uses more total silicon.  Really arguably N31 should have been the starting point for MCM configurations, that seems to be the lowest point where it makes sense as a design tradeoff right now.  N32 would have been better off monolithic (it can't be a contender in laptops without being monolithic tbh)\n\nKnock 10% off the price and It's Fine.  I honestly didn't think they'd be willing to go this low but yeah, $350 is fine for what it is.\n\n7700XT is another example of a perfectly Fine card that's gotten caught up in the hysteria around this whole generation (from both brands), just like the 7600XT.  At $350 you are paying maybe a 10% perf/$ premium for RDNA3 over RDNA2, and that is a bet that I'm willing to take especially in the low-end market.  5nm > 7nm, better RT, better AI (opening the door for a proper DLSS competitor), guaranteed Antilag+ support, etc etc.  The value of the newer thing isn't zero, and perf/$ isn't the same thing as value.  For a bet of maybe $30 of actual value, I'll take the newer thing.\n\nIt's gonna be fine folks, RDNA2 inventory will eventually sell through and open a gap for RDNA3 prices to slide downwards a bit too.  And at that point the 7600XT/7700XT/etc will be utterly Fine.\n\nAMD is learning the same lesson NVIDIA did the hard way after the 2018 mining crash - in a world of slowing progress, letting clearance sales get too out-of-hand will lead to a wave of bad reviews and salty consumers.  Locking in the value of those clearance sales isn't good enough for people anymore, and even if you adjust the prices later (like 2070S) people will stay butthurt about the whole generation forever.  If people continue being weird about clearance sales, if reviewers continue blasting every product in every generation for \"the clearance-priced thing is better!\", the obvious answer is to not have clearance sales.  AMD doesn't have to provide MDF or discounts at the end of the gen to get things gone, they can just wait for it to sell through like NVIDIA does.

That 8GB is not enough in some cases now is because of some games being heavily optimized for the consoles, and the weakest (Xbox Series S) can access 10GB from the GPU.

There is also 7900XT to 7800XT, $499 to $899, but there is at least 7900 GRE in that gap even if it isn’t widely available. I’m sure AMD WANTS to put something in that lower gap, but I’m not sure what that card is. A third tier Navi 32 is of course an option, but the confusing pricing of the 7700XT (and quite frankly, the stupid naming of the entire lineup) makes me think that they don’t want to price any of their chiplet designs any lower for whatever reason - more likely capacity than cost, but it could be either.\n\nFaster Navi 33 seems unlikely as the boost clock is already the highest in the lineup. Of course they could upgrade the VRAM clock to 20GHz effective, but that’s about it, and I don’t think Navi 33 is bottlenecking that hard on memory bandwidth anyway.",
      "How I've always seen it:\n\nWhat it's called --> What it actually is\n\n7900XTX --> 7900XT\n\n7900XT --> 7800XT\n\n7800XT --> 7700XT\n\n7700XT --> 7600 XT\n\n7600 --> 7500 XT\n\n\nAnd it's ridiculous that the inflation adjusted price of a 8GB card is the same in 2023 as it was in 2016. Price range for the listed models should be something like $150-$750.",
      "I respectfully disagree. There is a gaping hole in both performance and price between the 7600 and 7700XT.",

      "> \"Super\" is never\n\nThe 2070 Super was the same price as the 2070. Same with the 2080 Super.",
      "And what MSRP difference?  It would cost virtually the same to make and there's only a $50 gap to squeeze it into and that's less than the existing difference between AIB 7800XTs.  IDK maybe AMD plan to cut the 7700XT MSPR?",
      "IMO 40% is not enough of a jump to upgrade at similar pricing, let alone higher pricing. You would think that 2 gens later, you should be getting at least 2x performance for the same price. Sadly this reflects the trend of diminishing performance gains every gen thanks to inflation and physics. I don't expect to have to upgrade my 6700xt for atleast another 5 years given how slow GPU hardware is improving.\n\nVRAM can be a reason to upgrade if certain games can't run or can only display a blurry mess which is the case with a number of new games on 8gb cards.",
      "I couldn't care less about these. My sticking to the 5700 XT is solely about the absurd pricing of the existing lineup. Releasing more overpriced cards won't make me upgrade or recommend an upgrade to anyone else. Just bring down prices to sensible levels. The $7900 XTX barely hitting a 10% discount after a year is crap. Holding the 7800 XT back a year (3 years after the 6800 XT that performs the same) doesn't make the $500 price tag look good.",
      "If enough people are smart like the poster you replied to the prices will fall before that. I’ll also sit on my 3060TI for another few years if I can’t get a true midrange card again for less than €400.",
      "7850XT would make more sense to compete with 4070 Super.",
      "For real, price difference between 7700XT and 7800XT is already so low that it makes no sense to even consider 7700XT and just go for 7800XT. If they significantly drop the price on 7700XT then it would make sense but then the 7800 non XT would become pointless to consider.",
      "It’s completed in the sense that they have released an SKU for each die. Doesn’t mean they won’t release a different variation for each die.",
      "Nvidia's rumours are Super refreshes of existing GPUs, which will also come with price rises. How exciting is that?",
      "1650, 1660, 2060 Super were more for more.\n\n2070, 2080 Super were more for the same.\n\nAlthough the 2080 Super was only like 5% more perf.",
      "The 4070 Super will probably be more expensive than the 7900 XT.\n\nI don't know why people are in denial about Nvidia's pricing. \"Super\" is never a price cut or even price stabilisation; it's something like 8% more performance for 15% more money...",
      "They could always buy an used card for a more reasonable price a few years down the line if it comes to a point where the RX 5700 XT is too outdated.",
      "No, there's two possible reasons for the 7800.\n\n1. Vram prices crashed hard just before the launch of the 7700xt. You can get 8gb of gddr6 for $25 pretty much and this happened around June 2023. With the lead time to a product launch, the August release of the 7700xt was likely planned prior to these prices collapsing.\n\n2. Yields of the dies are good enough AMD wants to up the CUs. It could also be AMD found 60 CUs at lower clocks is perfectly stable, so there's no need to cut down to 54 when they could sell 60 just at a lower clock speed.\n\nSo, there are at least two reasons I see for this that make sense."

      "MSRP + $100 incoming...",
      "Just please keep them as close to MSRP as possible. Especially the white because we all know there is usually a ridiculous added charge on white gpus",
      "Jake,\n\nA 850W PSU is recommended for the 7800XT...is that a mistake?\n\nWhen will the clock speeds be announced?\n\nThanks.",
      "1. The cards look great,  but tbh they need to stay as close to MSRP as possible,  or else they're DOA.   \n2. The white model looks the best in my opinion, but I don't like the yellowish logos.   \n3. A giveaway would be a good way to connect with consumers and give back to the community.  Just saying ;)",
      "Considering that the Suggested PSU for 7900 XT is 700W (750W in the ASUS PSU Table), that should be a huge overestimation.",
      "If they cost 10% more than MSRP then they're not worth it",
      "This, unfortunately. White is a real pain and challenge to get the color matching perfectly. Black blends better but white shows everything and even a slightly different hue can be apparent.",
      "We should have pricing soon and I’ll update when we do. Part of why we’ve targeted the TUF series was to help keep prices a bit more reasonable compared to some other options.",
      "That seems like an oversight to me OR that the article was written prior to actually receiving confirmed numbers, which is likely. I’ll pass this along. Like u/poppoo143 mentioned, the higher tier card already states a lower wattage psu.",
      "Personally I feel like the TUF Gaming line as a whole is missing on an opportunity to distance itself from \"gaming\" and be a sleeker more minimalist brand (as it is your cheaper option). I think at this point the whole \"gaming\" marketing in the computer component world is very oversaturated and as of today you could go as far as calling it \"gimicky.\" I'm a gamer, I don't need my components to say it on them. I'm aware I can game on my GPU and Mobo, that is what I bought it for after all. You already have the ROG brand, the TUF Gaming brand is starting to = cheaper asus brand, more than just gaming computer components which I think was the original intention when TUF Gaming launched.\n\nSimply put, if I were the VP of marketing I'd drop \"Gaming\" from \"TUF\" and try to capitalize on the anti-rgb movement and have it be a minimalist, sleek line and pivot from the \"cheap, downgraded ROG\" line that it has become synonymous with. Kind of like pro-art, but again not targeting any specific group. Let's be real, it's not like the consumer hardware itself would physically change if gaming was the focus or not. No board partner made \"mining\" focused hardware brands for example. Your Pro-art GPU dies aren't any different from your TUF or ROG brands.\n\nI would never buy Asus TUF Gaming branded products new unless they were steeply discounted, which is almost never the case, because I assume they're just intentionally built worse than they could be and usually they're not priced as such. And conversely I'd never buy your Strix brand new because I assume that the relative performance increase doesn't align with the price increase. Maybe what I'm asking for is to merge TUF and Pro-art into an economy brand, that is a general economy brand, priced at the bottom of the stack that doesn't feel \"gimicky and intentionally cheaper.\" Like a brand I'd buy for myself and not my 8 year old nephew because he can't have nice things yet. A big part of the problem is the Strix line is infamously overpriced at this point so it makes the TUF Gaming line seem way worse than it is.\n\nYour competitors do a much better job of differentiating and blending their brand tiers in my opinion. Take MSI for example, they have the ventus, Gaming trio & Suprim cards. When I think of the two Asus brands I think of intentionally worse thus overpriced gaming, and very overpriced, high quality gaming. MSI? Ventus is cheap and crappy, gaming trio is more expensive but performs to that bump while establishing a middle ground and then suprim is splurge. Not to say Strix doesn't compete with Suprim, but there's no middle ground for Asus and the juxtaposition between TUF and ROG is too big and obvious. MSI boards? I couldn't even tell you how that branding works, but all I know is they're not clearly pitted against each other as cheap vs overpriced. And Asus mobos still aren't out of the woods from voltage-gate from a public perception standpoint. ASRock? Same story as MSI, unique branding, no \"gaming\" overkill and sensible tiering.",
      "It’s actually not ridiculous for white to be a more expensive color. It is harder to get good yields on white injection molded parts and painted parts. Which means either parts are rejected and then scrapped or reworked. In either case that leads to more money be necessary to make a unit. The auto industry does similar. The white colors tend to be an up charge color.",
      "Recommended means nothing dude. I have a 850w psu for my 7900xtx. You're 750w psu is more than enough.",
      "Bro 3080 10GB is arguably the worst to get right now, the 7800xt will probably match its performance or slightly supersede with 6GB more vram for proper 2k or 4k textures in the near future. \n\nThese recommendations are really meant for typical buyers who usually have shitty Psu ... for example a noname 850w psu (such as that infamous series from Gigabyte) cannot match a solid 650w from FSP. Hence, they have to inflate these recommendation numbers in case some dumb ass uses these no name psus\n\nJust have a solid 650-700w and you should be fine with these mid range gpu",
      "I would like to know whether the coolers are repurposed nvidia ones or not. Some ASUS radeon cards have coolers designed for nvidia models, probably to save cost of development idk.",
      "Haha giveaways aren’t off the table though my personal preference is to first have some open and honest dialogue. Giveaways can muddy the waters on feedback and honest discussion.\n\nThanks for the feedback on the cards!",
      "Car paint =/= plastic parts for GPU.\n\nAlso white color isn't always the cheapest for cars, sometimes you need to pay extra for white.",
      "Yeah, ASUS GPUs are notoriously overprices to point I just pretend they dont exist. I like ProArt series with more reasonably sized coolers for motherboards with dual x8/x8. But again 2.7 slot sized cooler is going to kill any GPU with 2nd expansion card if it bit longer than wifi which you never put into x8 slot anyway. Usually HBA cards or 2nd GPU or high end 40G fiber NIC that actually needs the lanes.",
      "I like the rgb, it's not over the top. Looking at an 7800xt for a friend just waiting on availability and price in NZ, really happy with my tuf xtx",
      "I liked the older TUF Sabertooth(X99/Z87/990FX etc.) aesthetic more than the more recent yellow TUF design. Seems like a massive downgrade.   \nROG/Strix lines seem super upcharged while being hit-or-miss quality wise.",
      "I run a 6800xt with a 850w and its nowhere near maxing it out plus 6800 xt is less efficient compared to a 7800xt."

    "selftext": "I'm seeing numerous posts on here saying that the 7700 XT is really just a 7700 or even a 7600 XT class card. Heck, even the 7600 is not spared although I think it performs fine as a 6600 successor. Are people just parroting what others online are saying?\n\nLet me break it down for you:\n\n* Architecture: They are both Nx2 classes (N32 vs N22)\n* Memory Capacity: Both 12GB\n* Memory Bus Width: 192 bit\n\nBut that's where the similarities end. It is much closer to a 6800 non-XT than it is to the 6700 XT\n\n||RX 7700 XT|RX 6700 XT|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Core Count|54 CU|40 CU|\n|Boost Clock Speed|2544 MHz|2424 MHz|\n|TDP|245W|230W|\n|MSRP|$449|$479|\n\nIMO, it a worthy successor to the 6700 XT and at a $30 discount, bringing much more features and significant performance uplift.\n\nIf anything that the 7700 XT should be guilty of is that it is priced too high or too close to the 7800 XT.\n\n**EDIT:** Again I want to clarify, not spotlighting the price (that is a separate debate), it's that people won't stop labeling it as a 7700/7600 XT. Even if they do label it as a 7700, people will complain the price is too high, but the performance would be greatly above its predecessor (6700).",
    "comments": [
      "Yeah it seems good but people are pissed it's priced so close to the 7800 XT. I think a $70-80 difference would set them apart better (either increasing one or decreasing the other).",
      "GN nailed it - at $50 gap it's not worthwhile, at $100 it's extremely compelling.",
      "You can't really compare release MSRPs because the 6700XT is now selling for $330.   \nPeople are disappointed that the 7700Xt is priced at $450 because the 7800XT is \\~20% better and 11% more expensive, essentially funneling everyone toward a higher price bracket.   \n\n\nThe 7700XT doesn't really fill a meaningful position in AMD's GPU lineup right now, at the $450 price point.",
      "Because if they released it at $400 they'd have the $330 6700xt and $350 3750xt collecting dust. Inevitably the 6000 GPUs will sell out and the 7700xt price will drop to $400 or less. Sucks but if they got stock to move they're going to price it around making it move. \n\nBasically where it sits now pushes people up to 7800XT or pushes them down to a 6750 or 6700. Once the bottom of this tier falls out (6000 series sold out and done), the price of the 7700Xt falls in response. Its pretty basic business and is done with almost every product you buy that has recurring releases.",
      "I live in Europe, and the price gap is actually roughly €100 here. The 7700 XT retails for around €520-550 and the 7800 XT is around €620-650, depending on XFX/Sapphire/Asus etc. (including all taxes and stuff).",
      "Yeah, people easily forgot what happened just a generation ago. if 7800XT is really priced that good then keep saying that 7700 should drop in price, can't the opposite also happen in which the 7800xt might actually increase in price? \n\ni am in a region where GPU prices tend to stick to what is release price and dont decrese BUT will actually increase in price if its always sold",
      "So AMD should just raise 7800xt prices! \n/s",
      ">Are people just parroting what others online are saying?\n\nthey're all saying the same thing because it's true, why would you buy the 7700 XT when you could get the bigger 7800 XT for just $80 more?\n\n$80 is a small gap for the current GPU economy today, and it's certainly better than the $170 difference between the 6700 XT vs 6800 XT.\n\nthe 7800 XT is not only faster, it also has 16GB of VRAM, quite a few RT cores and should only draw like 50-60watts more.\n\nthe 7700 XT is not a bad card, I've not seen anyone say that anywhere. it's position in the market is just weird.\nhere's hoping for a price cut for the 7700 XT.",
      "Then why would you ever buy a 7800xt or 7700xt when 6800xt is 500 brand new.",
      "If 7800xt rises more in price, then there is less actual incentive to chooce 7800xt over 4070 so i doubt it will go that way if amd is smart.",
      "What a level-headed take",
      "Mindfactory sold many 7800 xt units for 559€, sadly other countries tend to get screwed with pricing.",
      "So AMD should raise 6800xt prices too!!",
      "It's even more pointless to compare it to heavily discounted 6800xt cards, that will disappear from the market in a few weeks. \nThe 7600 was compared to the 6700 10GB discounted to sub $300, which never had many cards on sale to begin with.",
      "Not everyone makes purchasing decisions from the mindset of \"what is the absolute maximum amount of money I can possibly spend?\"\n\nI could afford a 4090, but there's no chance Nvidia is getting $1,600 out of me. I could afford a 7950X3D, but it would be a waste. If the price:performance is close, yeah, I'll eat a bit of value for more performance (say, 30% more performance for 40% more money). However, with stuff like the 7700 XT and 7800 XT, it's easy to fit another $50 in the budget.\n\nHeck, there are times I'm debating between going all-out for a top-tier product to keep for a long time or getting something with much better value and upgrading more frequently.\n\nThat said, neither of these cards really does it for me. If the 7800 XT were $50 cheaper, I'd maybe get it. The 7700 XT needs to be more like $80-100 cheaper, IMO. If the 7800 XT comes down a bit for Black Friday, I might pick it up, but the 7700 XT has to be stupidly good value to convince me it's enough of an upgrade from my 5700 XT AND that I shouldn't just buy a 7800 XT for a little more.",
      "You can't really compare \"is now selling for\" prices either.\n\nA 6700 XT here (Philippines) is still $460. However, a 6750 XT is $440 - because the retailers got newer stock for it at a lower price. It used to be $540. It's also why a 6950 XT is cheaper than a 6800 XT.",
      "I'm so fuckin confused why every outlet insists on basing their review on MSRP and not *performance*. In 6 months none of their conclusions will make sense because the prices have shifted. \n\nI mean go watch everyone's reviews of 6700 XT or 6800 XT etc from last year. They all shit on it for being too expensive, and some even *re-reviewed* it after prices normalized. \n\nPeople use your recommendations well after launch. Like years later even. Including MSRP as a consideration is absolutely pointless beyond mentioning its current price. Because when you watch it a year later for a recommendation, suddenly the videos telling you to not buy a perfectly good card because they think it's not a good deal.",
      "Higher? The 7800xt is at the highest price to make sense at all, any higher price and the 6800xt gets a far better alternative...\nIt should be named the 7800 and the 7700xt should be a bit less. I'm sure prices will go down a bit soon, but for now Amd again somewhat fuck up the lunch with the naming and will get hate again.",
      "All that matters is current relative prices. Why would you buy a 6700xt when 6750xt is cheaper or 6800xt when 6950xt is cheaper. \n\nJust like why would we buy a 7800xt when 6800xt is cheaper. \n\nMsrp doesnt matter what matters is new avaliablity prices.  \n\nJust look back at 30 series and 6000 series releases. Msrp didnt mean a thing.",
      "Yeah, I live in Sweden and our taxes are pretty high (and our currency is kind of crap right now) so that may explain the slightly higher prices. Still, the difference between the 7700/7800 is roughly €100ish (depending on board partner)"

Since performance/$ is almost always increasing over time, the longer they take to sell 6800's, the lower the profits.\n\nIf you buy a 6800 over a 7700 XT and think you're pulling a fast one on AMD, you're wrong.",

By the time FSR 3 comes out DLSS 3.0 will have matured and have made its way into games, basically meaning FSR 3.0 is probably going to have the same issue as previous iterations—adoption rate. Next problem will be RT performance, power consumption, content creation, and probably pricing to compete. \n\nAs seen with the comparison between the 4070Ti and 7900XT, rasterization performance alone isn’t going to sell a lot of cards, feature sets are going to dictate what card has better value. \n\nI had high hopes for AMD with the 7xxx series, but when I see basically normal generational steps up with their lineup while not pushing the envelop and charging high prices, it really disheartened me. \n\nNvidia, while still expensive, saw some nice gains, especially in the 4070Ti, while also bringing out a much more robust feature set at launch, and nailing the power consumption, unlike AMD that just keeps promising, is why I chose Nvidia this time around. \n\nC’mon AMD, innovate!

The current prices are insane, and the lowest RDNA 2 discounted cards are the only ones that remotely approach what i consider a fair pricing. \n\nSeriously, it wasn't long ago when the top end GPU was like $500.

And then $1600. \n\nIt's insane. \n\nHeck, I remember in the late 2000s you could get like a 9800 GTX for like $250 or something. \n\nI remember my first GPU being a $80 3650 and my first \"REAL\" GPU being a 5850 for like $300 or something.\n\nAnd that was like the fourth strongest single card on the market at the time, only below the 5870, 470, and 480. \n\nI mean I remember when the market had like several tiers of products in the $100-200 price range alone.

AMD no longer has a **90 competitor, yet they've reintroduced the XTX SKU for some reason. RX 7000 GPUs have all the downsides of being MCM products with none of the benefits.

      "TLDR:\n\n7700xt stomps on the 4060ti at rasterization so hard its not funny (12% better at 1080p and like 25% at 4k) but is a little worse at ray tracing (10% worse at 1080p and like 2-3% worse at 4k). However at 1440p the 4060ti is still only getting like mid 40’s fps ray tracing so ray tracing is kinda pointless for cards at this level",
      "The main draw isn't ray tracing, the main draw is dlss vs fsr. Personally, I'll pick the Rx 7700xt just for the VRAM. Even if dlss is better, it doesn't look any better if I have to drop texture quality.",
      "Why is this being released now, and not back when the 7700 XT / 4060 TI cards released?",
      "But 8 gigs of vram isn't enough even at 1080p in modern games. What looks worse, unrendered textures, or no upscaler? 8 gb is doa at this price.",
      "12%-25% better at rasterization, verse 2%-10% worse at ray tracing.\n\nthere is a huge difference between 2-10 and 12-25 broski. If you are in  the RTX product stack, that jump is like a 200$ price premium to jump to the 4070 to get that raster bump.",
      "7800 XT outperforms the 7700 XT by \\~15-20%. If this is worth the extra cost to you, then go for it.",
      "7800xt absolutely smokes the 7700xt. If you can stretch the extra you won’t regret it.",
      "So AMD stomps when it’s 12% better at rasterisation, but AMD is only a little worse when it’s 10% worse at 1080p…![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)",

You can argue that 7700xt is a better card using legitimate reasons, there is no need to do what you did sounding like a fanboy",
      "Hey guys, seen a lot of discussion about 7700xt and 7800xt is 7700xt better option if the price gap brtween those two is 120e ?",
      "Only with FG, and even then that's because you're not actually rendering those extra frames.",
      "The 16GB model of the 4060ti has come down in price quite a lot in the EU. \n\nIts now pretty much on par with the 7700XT both at around 420€.\n\nWhich makes it a really tempting option unlike when it was in the high 400's.\n\nIt just depends what you value more. Better raster performance or better RT, better Frame-Gen, better upscaling, better AI perormance, reflex and +4GB of VRAM.",
      "Absolutely worth imo. I've had since release and I've had 0 issues with it and it's been fantastic for 1440p in literally any game.",
      "DLSS loses to itself at 1080p. You shouldn't use it at that resolution unless you're desperate",
      "RT is utterly useless on a 4060ti. I think it's going to take another generation or two until it hits the mainstream. Looking at how a 4090 struggles with RT in newer titles like  Alan Wake past 1440p let alone 4k. I doubt it's going to be important anytime soon. Look at how RT turned out for the 2080. New technologies always punish early adopters.",
      "But they are not 4k cards so those numbers are irrelevant. Might as well say that 4060ti is [190%](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-benchmark-test-performance-analysis/6.html) faster in cp2077 path tracing but who cares when framerates are unacceptable",
      "I really love how RT is used as an pro Nvidia argument even on those cards that are basically unable to run it. Yes, some folks will buy crap GPU like RTX 4050 arguing it does ray traycing better. Plus DLSS on 1080p isn´t exactly peachy either, so maybe focusing on pureraster power in these low segments isn´t such a stupid thing to do?",
      "Honestly, you're an idiot if you're using rt with either card.",
      "Sapphire. No brainer choice. It was one of the cheapest for me.\n\nI'm heavily against buying Asus/Msi/Gigabyte since I don't like when they do both AMD and Nvidia. \n\nI prefer main-amd/main-nvidia partners.\n\nI have the Nitro+ and I don't think I've ever heard those fans ramp up. Very good cooling.\n\nXfx is also very very good and also powercolor.\n\nPick whichever fits your budget best.",
      "No it was a good card all though it was power hungry. \n\nMine dying was my own fault not the fault of the cards. I had mine water cooled and spilled water on it when I was upgrading the cpu."

      "I think this is true but in practice however, due to ASUS negligence of actually producing TUF products that made it through the review cycle unscathed - they were forced to make them \"budget\" offerings for a long time. And their TUF motherboards are also priced towards the low end.\n\nIt's only really this current GPU generation where a \"TUF\" GPU is actually of good quality - but still hardly a first choice on AMD.\n\nAnd their TUF motherboards continue to be very inconsistent. \n\nTL:DR asus can't consistently make quality TUF branded stuff so the pricing is equally inconsistent.",

That's around the price of a 6800, but with less VRAM. Plus you can find 6800s for $430, which is the maximum this card should have been. AMD probably saw how bad the 4060s were and got a little too confident.",
      "On AMD's own slides the 7800XT is 20% faster than a 7700XT for 11% more. There is definitely something weird going on like yields are really good, so they are making many more 7800XT and don't really want to sell 7700XT???",

      "It's terrible.  Why is the 7700XT so expensive😭 I hope half a month goes by and the price drops to at least 400€... My RX580 is about to die, I can't wait anymore, I want to play starfield...",

It has AI cores that would be needed for future iterations of FSR and therefore those cards would last longer than 6000 series despite their similar raster performance right now.\n\nThat's objective. 'Upscaling looks horrible' and 'Fake Frames are not real frames' are subjective.",

But then again most of the fanbois are, no matter the brand, right? It's just that the leather jacket man is perhaps too good of a cult leader.\n\nEDIT: Harsh truth is that this whole GPU gen is a mess. That is ofc partly due to previous crypto craze & insane GPU prices.\n\nWhat saddens me most are two things. Nvidia being so dominant to the point of making extra sure as not to provide \"too much\" of performance at each perf tier while also skimping on VRAM. \n\nAnother thing is AMD super closely following Nvidia's greedy price scheme and trying to give as low discount as possible to remain interesting choice.\n\nI think that if at least ONE of these factors improved drastically, it would be so good for gamers in general.

It only suffers from shimmering of distant objects compared to DLSS, not in terms of texture or detail reconstruction. It does fine details really well, like power lines, fences, gates, grills vs TAA.\n\nIf FSR2 iteration fix shimmering, to me, there's no real advantage to XeSS or DLSS2 anymore.",
      "Well the issue with AMD is consistency. They have years of having the \"bad driver\" stigma, hardware that runs extremely hot, consumes a lot of power, etc. They finally latched onto something good with the Vega series but never put much into it, then released RDNA with the 5700XT which was a great performer plagued with serious teething issues for quite some time. Then finally got it right with the 6000-series with an awesome performance to the dollar ratio, but then they released the 7000-series which strayed away from what was getting them there by trying to price match Nvidia at the outset, while not offering the consumers anything extra bona-fide features like DLSS, FG, or Reflex, and learned really quickly what the market is willing to bear considering their market share and had to drop prices, but only after it was too late. To add, yes, I know FSR 2.2 is decent, but it's available for all GPU's, meaning it's not an AMD only feature, and it's inferior to DLSS so I wouldn't even bring it up when talking about feature sets. The only worthwhile feature on the AMD side is SAM, but even so, it's not a real selling point. \n\nNvidia can afford a misstep because they've time and time again over 25 years have shown that for every misstep follows a series of great GPU's, and while they've had their fair share of controversies, the numbers never lied hence why they've maintained a solid lead for quite some time now. People call it mind share, well yes, it is mindshare when you're known for consistently releasing quality products while your competitors are hit or miss. Average Joe's don't want to fuck around and gamble with hundred's if not a thousand dollar purchase by going with AMD, they'd rather go with Nvidia because of the reputation, which is the same reason people just buy iPhones over Samsung's or whatever other top Android brand there is, reputation. \n\nI agree though on the everyone wanting to make excuses for AMD. Being an avid AMD user myself, and having owned the last three generations of GPU's from AMD I used every excuse under the sun from price to performance, to VRAM, to power consumption to justify buying a 6700XT over a 3070/Ti. It only occurred to me when I went back to Nvidia with my 4070Ti that I was an idiot for trying to justify a poor purchasing decision, not saying the 6700XT was bad, but the 3070 is a better overall GPU when considering the whole package. While yes, you can make the argument that I could have gone with the \"technically\" better 7900XT, at the time the cost difference between the two was $135 in favor of the 4070Ti, and in hindsight, the sheer amount of features alone would have still pulled me over to team green even if the two were priced similarly. \n\nAMD's niche is VRAM, they slap a ton of it on their GPU's, but unfortunately once we get to the point to where 12GB isn't enough for 1440p or below, people will be looking at the 60-series/9000 series GPU's, and that 20GB on the 7900XT or 24GB on the 7900XTX won't mean shit except for being able to pump up texture quality, all the while Nvidia 40-series GPU's will still get by with it's feature set. I know a lot of people are probably going to start quoting FSR 3, but look, it has to be implemented into the game by the developer for it to properly work. If PureDark is anything to go by, DLSS and Frame Generation can easily be added without the developers needing to be involved and still work properly, unlike FSR 3, which means it is more readily available to the end consumer--which that right there automatically gives Frame Generation a big W. \n\nTo end this essay--AMD needs to invest in features, and embrace things like RT more seriously. While I won't say raw power isn't preferred, at the end of the day eventually that raw power isn't enough, and developers can only optimize so much, which is where feature sets, like you said, will be the deciding factor and something like DLSS, Reflex, and Frame Gen will easily be worth the extra cost, even if AMD's product offers better out of the box performance.",
      "Early bird gets the worm. Nvidia being the first to embrace RT, and temporal upscaling has been a tremendous boon for them. You'd think AMD would follow suit and invest more resources into combating DLSS, but they seem to be happy with what they have, but they forget that it's the consumers who they should be aiming at making happy, not just themselves. If AMD offered a serious competitor to DLSS that was on par, I'd seriously consider going back to using AMD. It's just their track record doesn't instill confidence in me, and their thing about making everything open source doesn't exactly help them when combating  Nvidia. People cite open source like it's some kind of bastion, but really it's more for hobbyists, the average consumer doesn't care about \"open source,\" they care about what's better. \n\nHow many folks are willing to jump through hoops, browse github, or spend hours on end improving on something when they can just buy a competing product that offers the best experience right out of the box? Ease of use and peace of mind are worth the couple hundred dollar differences.",

So it'll still likely be slower because of a limited PCIe bus vs the 3060ti if you play at settings that use like 10-12gb of VRAM.\n\n...

AM5 requires significantly stronger power delivery, bios capacity, and DDR5, all of which cost more.\n\nThere IS no 'equivalent' AM4 board.  There are none with similar power delivery either.    AM5 has SVI3,  AM4 has SVI2.   This means different power ICs and mosfets -- and these are not yet high enough volume to bring prices down.  (once Zen4 Epyc is ramped up and these have greater supply, it will lower costs quite a bit for AM5).  So you can't compare the # of phases of some AM4 board to an AM5 one and declare them the 'same'.  \n\nAre mobo manufacturers trying to take a larger cut?   Probably.   But there is competition, and when prices don't lower while there is sufficient competition, the reason must be either supply constraints or higher costs.\n\nIts a little of both here:  higher costs for DDR5 mobo traces/layers, higher costs for various power delivery components, and related supply issues for power ICs for those (that essentially keep costs higher).",

DDR4 is still very competitive in gaming and if it allows you to go with a cheaper CPU and a cheaper motherboard maybe that's not an awful decision for losing 5% here and there.  13600K is a very competitive CPU for the price, so is 5800X3D, and if you have memory already and maybe a motherboard then AM5 still looks like an overall bad deal even if \"it's got DDR5\".\n\nAnd Zen4's memory controller is *really fucking bad*, like it probably won't POST with 4 sticks unless they're single-rank and low-speed.  [wendell talks about it here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P58VqVvDjxo) but it's not really limited to 128GB, it's any dual-rank sticks, and even a lot of single-rank sticks don't do great with 4 slots, and you are going to significantly reduce available bandwidth (from 70GB/s with 2 sticks down to about 50GB/s - this is not insignificant). You are basically buying the ddr5 equivalent of the early super finicky b350 boards.\n\nHUB being HUB of course they completely shat on DDR5 for a year straight when it was Intel-exclusive, it *just isn't ready yet guys*, meaning AMD hadn't launched theirs yet, but the moment AM5 launched that was the moment DDR5 was ready and you were a big moron if you were still buying DDR4.  Truth be told it still is not ready yet, things haven't changed from july or august really other than AMD having their product out now (and it's much worse than Intel in terms of memory controller).  The launch gouging was winding down within a couple months, decent RAM came out within a couple months, but the AMD platform just isn't there yet.  \n\nWe will see what prices do in the future, AMD is supposedly designing their platform around smart power stages, which drives up the cost relative to AM4 (and LGA1700), and AMD is intent on selling you 2 chipsets even if they aren't needed (de facto this is just moneygrubbing from AMD - nobody actually connects more than 3 pcie slots even on a $1300 board, nobody really needs the expansion from the second chipset, it's just a way for AMD to capture a little more revenue selling you something that's hardly even used).  Prices may not come down as much as people are hoping, and when AMD says \"cheaper boards are coming\" what they most likely mean is A620, ie even shittier and worse boards, not so much that decent B650/X670 boards are going to come way down.\n\nEven as someone who is really into the idea of a AVX-512 + v-cache system, I'm really dubious about that memory controller and I think it's probably better to just wait a year and see what happens.  I expect 8000 series chips and better motherboards and lower prices will fix most of the complaints.",
      "No. Prices are basically the same from B660 and Z690 MSRP to B760 and Z790 MSRP. The pricing difference is mostly because 600 series is 'old' and thus is on sale now, despite being 95% as good. You can find more 700 series boards under $200 than you can AM5 board."

    "selftext": "[https://wccftech.com/rgt-radeon-rx-7800-xt-rx-7700-xt-rx-7600-xt-and-rx-7600-gpu-performance-targets-and-specs/](https://wccftech.com/rgt-radeon-rx-7800-xt-rx-7700-xt-rx-7600-xt-and-rx-7600-gpu-performance-targets-and-specs/)\n\nHonestly, those specs don't inspire confidence in team Red for me this go 'round if they're true. The 7800XT is seeing maybe a 25 -30% bump in performance in best case scenarios with better RT performance, and the 7700XT is probably seeing similar results, but when compared to their last gen-counterparts the 7700XT is probably looking more like a re-badged 6800 possibly XT, and the 7800XT is basically a re-badged 6950XT with better RT performance.\n\nThe only card in there that's worth noting is the 7800XT, it'll be almost comparable to a 4070Ti, which I just upgraded from 6700XT to. The 7700XT looks like it'll fall victim to the same fate as the 6700XT, priced in no-man's land with middling performance.\n\nI was talking to some friends earlier about this--for the 7800XT to even succeed it has to be priced \"realistically\" no higher than $650-$700 only because Nvidia is the go-to for a lot of gamers, AMD has a lot of ground to cover, and despite what some might say, Frame Generation is probably the best feature I've seen on a GPU in a long time; that and DLSS support sold me on switching sides for this gen. DLSS has been one of the features keeping Nvidia on top these past few gens, even against comparable AMD cards, and FSR just hasn't had the impact DLSS had, even being open source, the adoption rate and IQ combined versus DLSS has put it way behind.\n\nIt pains me to see how the x700 series being given the treatment it's getting. The 5700XT was such a great card, and the 6700XT improved upon it, but marginally, but still offered performance relative to a 2080Ti. The fact that the 7700XT might not even hit 6800XT levels of performance means this card is going to have to be realistically priced at $400-$450 for it to succeed, otherwise they're just handing Nvidia a victory this generation. The 4070, it's competition is going to be utilizing DLSS 3, and frame generation which is, in the eyes of the average consumer who doesn't understand tech but can read numbers is going to gravitate towards. The only thing that would push people to the 7700XT is if the 4070 is priced outrageously. Even then if Nvidia releases a 4060/Ti, it's probably going to eat the 7700XT's lunch in terms of sales.\n\nThe 7600XT is literally just a rebadge, plain and simple. Nothing to see here. :(\n\nSorry for the long post, but honestly the only card that piqued my interest from this gen would have been the 7700XT, but after pulling the trigger prematurely and getting the 4070Ti, honestly I'm happy I did. As much as it pains me to stray from team Red after six years,but I wanted something that was a step up from mid-range that would give me the option to play in 4k without spending over $1000, and I got the 4070Ti for $900 after sales taxes, which isn't bad for basically 3090Ti levels of performance, and about $132 less than what I would have gotten a sapphire/power color 7900XT. Was it pricey? Hell yes, but with it's performance level I'm easily seeing a good 3-4 years of usage from it, namely at 1440p.\n\nIt should be telling that the 4070Ti, despite it's price, is a card that AMD is going to have a tough time competing with considering it's nearest competitor, the 7900XT is only marginally better for $100-$150 more, and with the prices of the 7700/7800XT being unknown, AMD's got their hands full trying to figure a price that'll entice buyers. That's of course if these rumors are true.\n\nWhat do you guys think? You think AMD is on track, or do you think they blew their load a bit prematurely and forgot about the lower echelon of the RDNA3 cards?\n\nEdit: To clarify I was hoping and praying for AMD to pull a sucker punch on Nvidia and catch them off-guard to bring balance to the GPU market. I'm still hoping they do, or at least sell well, I would love to see AMD continue the trend of keeping Nvidia's pricing somewhat in check and maintaining decent performance, otherwise spending $900 on what can be viewed as mid-range will be nothing but a pipe dream in the years to come. I'm an AMD guy at the end of the day, even when the i7-2600k was god-tier I opted for AMD. ",

      "Thing is, here in Canada, a 6800s and above are pretty much non-existent, and what's n stock is priced close to a 7900XT, if not higher. It doesn't look much different with Nvidia cards. \n\nSo whereas theoretically the 6800XT and the 6900 cards are a better value at msrp, practically we don't see these prices nor stock available.",
      "I always love how posts reference retail prices like that doesn’t relate pretty much anywhere in the world other than the USA.",
      "AMD picked the wrong generation to invent the XTX SKU, because they can only really compete with Nvidia's (current) second-best. And that's ignoring the looming Ada Titan/4090 Ti.\n\nRemember when Navi 1 released? The highest model was the 5**7**00 XT, which was a clear indicator that it competed with the 20**7**0 (Super).\n\nLikewise, the 6**9**00 XT at least had a claim to fighting the 30**9**0 when it came to 1080p and 1440p without RT.\n\nBut the 7**9**00 XTX is only a match for the RTX 40**8**0 (which is significantly gimped compared to the 4090), and the RX 7**9**00 is hardly a match for the 40**7**0 **Ti**. Keep in mind that the RX 6**8**00 competed with the 30**7**0 **Ti**. I have no doubt that a 4080 Ti is coming as well.\n\nIt's clear that all RX 7000 products below the 7900 XTX are more gimped versions than they would have been, had AMD decided not to name that SKU as such. Navi 32 and 33 not having more Compute Units than their predecessors (like N31) combined with the name-fuckery means that AMD will have to offset core reductions on low & mid-range products with clock increases to try to have barely-not-stagnant performance. Truly a pathetic showing this generation. I hope for everyone's sake that most people outright reject these.",

Not that I'm turning a blind eye, just that it doesn't affect me, and my post was my opinion and thoughts based on what I know and am familiar with.",
      "AMD is not innovating and is just happy to ride NVIDIA's coattails  while only getting money largely from their fanboys",
      "AMD is going to have to be VERY competitive with their pricing if they want to move these cards at all especially with the lack of frame generation. Most people without this feature will quickly discredit it and write it off but with my hands on experience it's a game changer.",
      "What were you expecting them to be?\n\nI think performance estimates are too high, though. The 7900xt had 25% more bandwidth, and 20% more boost clock compute even after the clock bumps. We're probably talking 6900xt performance on average, with better RT and machine learning. Still behind the 4070ti in every way except VRAM.\n\nI guess people were expecting another  navi31 cut, maybe? 72 CU or something?",
      "Yeah, you're right. I know they haven't always been that way (RX 480 ≈ GTX 1060, as a recent example). I think my point was more that the past two generations *did* align with Nvidia's name scheme for the most part, and this generation doesn't. It's not so much a problem if the naming is consistently inconsistent, but suddenly no longer matching can lead to some bad expectations.\n\nI think the name of the 7900 XTX alone was a significant factor in making people believe AMD was going to match/beat the 4090.",
      "I think all these specs would have been great had AMD achieved the performance targets. Remember NVIDIA actually decreased CU's for cards compared to previous generation. But the performance uplift was so good that the cards still delivered better performance compared to cards with more CU's across the lineup.\n\nAMD didn't have much IPC gains or clock speeds and hence the 7000 series look lackluster in comparison.",
      "> The 7600XT is literally just a rebadge, plain and simple. Nothing to see here. :(\n\nIf it's based on the N33, then it clearly isn't a rebadge, but it won't be more than 20% faster (on avg) than N23 either, and even that isn't a given. RT should see more of a gain, but not sure how viable that is outside of perhaps RT shadows.",
      "Tbh I'm expecting prices to be a lot better than many doom and gloomers. 7900 XT is starting a hundred less than the 6900 XT and not selling. AMD tends to be quick to adjust prices to market, so I think it'll drop to 800, although probably not formally (AMD seems to favor reimbursing retailers behind the scenes to cut prices rather than formally adjusting MSRP).\n\nThe 7800 XT has 5/7 the CU count and value increases as you go down the stack. 5/7 * 800 = 571. So the 7800 XT is probably gonna be 550-630.\n\n6700 XT and below MSRP's were set during the shortages, 25% tariff, and cryptofuck epidemic. So they were higher than otherwise.\n\nThe 7700 XT is going to be getting 20% more CU's than the 6700 XT, so it will have 80% of the 7800 XT. Again, value tends to increase down the stack until you hit the 6 series. So .80 * 571 = 456.80. So probably 400-450 and it'll perform a bit over halfway between the 6800 and 6800 XT, probably closer to the 6800 XT.\n\n7600 XT is probably gonna be around 6700 XT performance. 7700 XT has 50% more CU's than it, 456.80 * 0.66 = 304). The 6 series is where value tends to drop off, so I think it'll be 300-340.\n\nThe 7600 is 28 CU's, or 7/8 the 6600/7600 XT. So it should be no trouble to match a 6600 XT and will probably come close to the 6650 XT. As for the price, 320 * 7/8 = 280.\n\nA lot of this will depend on what Nvidia is doing, but assuming Intel continues unfucking the drivers and reliably delivers 6700/XT level performance at 250 with the A750, competition is fierce.",

As long as reviews pan out and you can't get anything from the 3 trusted board partners (Sapphire, XFX, PowerColor) they're probably the best alternative. Gigabyte tends to just undersize designs and Asus loves to not do any work porting a Nvidia design to AMD. They've fucked up at least 3 cards this way the past decade",
      "I'm also curious about that. As far as I can tell from the available photos, ASRock, Asus and Sapphire models all look around 2.5 slots. The only one that seems promising so far is from XFX: Gamer's Nexus had a 7700 XT from XFX in the video, and it looks like it may be a true 2-slot design. Still waiting for the official specs though.\n\nGiven that 7800 XT and 7700 XT are close in TBP, XFX could save money by using the same cooler. So it's plausible they could offer RX 7800 XT in a 2-slot form as well.",
      "Usually, brands have a \"premium\" product and a \"standard\" product. Like Sapphire has a \"standard\" Pulse while a \"premium\" Nitro+. They add more fans, and so higher headroom for overclocking in their premium products. While the standard is still fine but not as higher headroom.",

Ryzen wasn't an absolute champion when it launched, but it was bringing technologies (specifically, higher core counts) to CPUs with near-Intel performance for a LOT less money.\n\nRadeon's version of that is being way behind on features and using \"we're pretty much even in raster\" to justify being close to Nvidia in price. I still don't get why people would laud the 7800 XT for bringing the $650 6800 XT's performance tier to $500 when the 6800 XT was 3 years old and already selling at $500. In the 7900 family, the XT was an embarrassment at $900, and the XTX's only selling point was \"Nvidia's pricing is worse.\"\n\nBoth companies are shit with their pricing, but AMD's lack of a mature, consistent product stack and set of features means they need to be consistently able to win on price. AMD hasn't done that in a while. I really hoped the 6000 series was a sign they were moving forward, but the 7000 series has been a wreck.",

Or will we see AMD holding out indefinitely? Especially if they still have a massive overstock of 6000 series cards gathering dust.\n\nWe are already seeing price cuts but are AMD and their partners (as well as retailers who paid in advance for stock) unwilling to make those cuts? Particularly if they are making significant losses on each card?\n\nAt any rate if they do launch them I do believe they need to come in at around 400 and 500 dollars respectively.\n\nI'm not seeing any rumors or leaks on these cards so I am just throwing this out there for discussion.",

      "I don't think with the current line-up that we will see 7700XT and 7800XT.\n\nMore probable will be a 16gb 7700 with performance between 6800 and 6800XT, and a 7800 with 16gb with a performance within 5-10% of the 7900XT.",
      "I don't know for sure but considering everything released so far I wasn't confident enough to wait for a 7700/7800xt. Also the 7800xt was released, AMD just called it a 7900xt and tried selling it 250$ over what the MSRP should have been.\n\nThis gen was a huge skip for me so I bought a used Nitro+ 6900xt for 400$ and don't regret it.",
      "I could see a 7800XT with performance right around the 6950XT, so \\~15% less than the 7900XT.\n\nI don't think a non-XT part would be placed that close to a next tier XT part, 6900XT is \\~30% faster than 6800, 6800XT is \\~40-50% faster than a 6700XT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso they need something against the 4060Ti, which is \\~30% faster than the 7600. With a 7700 between a 6800 and 6800XT, that would be \\~50% faster than a 7600, I could see that also as an 7700XT and then a 7700 10% below that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 7900XT is \\~2.3-2.5x as fast as the 7600, there is room for many GPUs in between there.\n\nSo my lineup would be\n\n7600 - full N33 (32 CU) - 165W - 100%\n\n7700 - heavy cut N32 (40 CU) - 185W - 120%\n\n7700XT - cut N32 (56 CU) - 230W - 160%\n\n7800XT - full N32 (64 CU) - 265W - 190%\n\n7900XT - cut 31 (84 CU) - 315W - 240%\n\n7900XTX - full N31 (96 CU) - 355W - 270%",

      "Makes no difference if they come or not. All that matters now is pricing. Anything north of 700 and it's already DOA. The second hand market is still going strong for a reason.\n\nPeople just aren't spending that much on a GPU anymore.",
      "It doesn't seem like they're worried about more releases or cooking up anything interesting. They're comfortable occupying this silly GPU lane of \"half the headlining features of an Nvida card for a 20% discount\" so what do they have to worry about. Innovating? Seriously competing? They just aren't that into the market. They want to be the cheapo knockoff that has never felt more like the cheapo knockoff.\n\nI really wish Intel would start fighting it out with a heavyweight card. Yeah it's against the odds, but if you ask me if I think there's any hope in hell AMD picks up the pace in desktop GPUs... no, I don't see it happening.",
      "If they release them now they must price RDNA2 super low, which in turn makes the old cards very good value and few will buy the new ones.\n\nThey just made too many last gen cards. This is also why the RTX4000 series is selling extremely poorly, I think the 4090 is actually the best sold model despite the price tag.",
      "Uh no.\n\nOne could argue that the 7900XT is the 7800XT but that would be quite an impressive improvement, 25% more VRAM and like 30% faster than a 6800XT and very capable of 4K gaming which the 6800XT wasn't due to low memory bandwidth.\n\nThe 7900XT is more like.. Between a 800 and 900 class card. And it has a very impressive memory bus alongside the infinity cache. I can kinda understand why they went with this naming scheme as the 7900XT is too fast for an 800 class card. Both are 900 class cards by specs.\n\nA 16GB 256-bit 7800XT is basically guaranteed and it will likely trade blows with the 6950XT in Raster and slightly faster in RT. Possibly better 4K performance depending on memory clocks.\n\nI wish the 7800XT would come with 20GB VRAM and the 7700XT with 16GB but it's likely going to be 16GB and 12GB this generation.\n\nExpect RDNA4 to be a bigger leap than RDNA3 was. Meanwhile for Nvidia the opposite is expected, Blackwell likely won't be that much faster than Ada, they have kinda hit the limit of a monolithic die with the 4090. But with Blackwell I expect a significant VRAM boost, with 24GB on the RTX5080 gaming flagship and 32GB on the 5090.",

      "It isn't, I don't get why people keep pushing this narrative. In terms of cost per frame it's like the second worst card in the lineup, it beats the 4080 but not by a huge margin. \n\nThe 4090 only looks good because it's the only card that had a big performance and cost per frame uplift compared to its predecessor, the problem is that the 3090 made zero sense compared to the 3080 at their respective MSRPs."

It'll take waiting for the reviews to know how loud it is though.\n\nThe price is higher than I've ever paid for a card but compared to the market it is fair for the performance.

Even with the 4090, there are games where the 7700 can’t maintain 60 fps at 1080p because the game is horribly threaded (Hogwarts with RT).  Jedi: Survivor with RT would be another title where you will see big differences and sub 60 fps performance.

      "All these CPU reviews tend to be very FOMO videos, *with a 4090. Most people likely wouldn't see a difference between a 5600 and a 7800x3d. At least now it's actually testing at Ultra 1440 and 4k, rather than; 4090, 7800x3d, 720p/1080p low which literally no one will ever use outside of CSGO or Valorant. But then most CPU reviews don't even test CSGO or Valorant so...",
      "As always, it depends on the games you play. I’m in a Discord channel for both TLOU and Jedi: Survivor, including a DLSS frame generation mod for each game. Several users with a 5800x3D cannot run Jedi: Survivor on a 4090 at a locked 60 fps (120 with FG) with RT because the CPU can’t handle it.  RT is integral to the lighting in that game - in fact it cannot be disabled on the consoles (or at least it couldn’t at release).\n\nTLOU scales much better up to 16 threads, but it really likes fast memory, and a user with a 5800x3D reported micro stutter which I could not reproduce at much higher fps on a 7800x3D with fast DDR5 memory. Locking the game to 60 or 120 with FG eliminates the microstutter, as it appears to be a memory bottleneck. \n\nHogwarts: Legacy is sub 60 fps on the 7700 with RT.  The 7800x3D is a massive 47% faster at 1080p - and you’ll see it at higher resolutions because you’ll still be CPU limited. \n\nNote that these tests don’t account for DLSS.  Cyberpunk shows major gains with RT on the 7800x3D which disappear at 1440p given the GPU demands of RT.  However, at DLSS quality at 1440p, you’ll be cpu limited again.  On a 4090 and 7800x3D, I see cpu limits at 3440x1440 DLSS quality at around 120 fps.\n\nThis testing does not account for frame generation - which really does miracles for CPU-limited games.  In such scenarios, you see true doubling in FPS and much smoother frametimes as you’re eliminating the CPU bottleneck. A locked 120 FPS with FG in Jedi Survivor at Epic settings with RT looks and feels great - and even on a 7800x3D or 13900KS, there are areas where you are limited to 70 fps without FG (Koboh town).",
      "As the other person said, they use these setups to make gaming artificially CPU bound in the assumption that the performance in CPU bound gaming situations would scale/compare the same way. They do what they do for a reason (and it's not FOMO), but it's also true that a lot of actual gaming setups don't benefit that much from high end CPUs (outside probably of the ones where they're being mated to equally high end or even higher GPUs)....",
      "The only real difference you'd notice would be going from the 5800x3d to the 7800x3d and that would still be barely noticeable in 1440 or 4k which us where most if not all gamers using a 4070 or higher are gaming.",

Then once the initial demand drops, the price is dropped, which lets in a new wave of sales. No one even cares about day 1 reviews at this point in the age of YouTube and influencers. It's only the reviewers who still think their day 1 negative reviews have any real-world impact on sales and how large corporations operate.",

The 4060 TI is trash, and Intel doesn't have a card up here, so it's basically AMD competing with itself.\n\nN32's price ceiling is 500 because any higher and the 4070 starts making more sense.\n\nHowever, despite such a small price range, yields aren't 100% perfect; they need two SKU's.\n\nThey're prioritizing 7800 XT's since that card has higher margins (both cards cost nearly the same to make). Thus, the only 7700 XT's are defective 7800 XT's, and yields are excellent, so there aren't many.\n\nThe market for a GPU also decreases exponentially as you go up in price. So if the 7700 XT was 400 dollars (price where it'd make sense on-paper), it would sell out considerably faster than the 7800 XT while still putting *some* downward pressure on the rest of the stack. Thus, its price can be made higher than that equillibrium point.\n\nNow, making a lineup of products is like protecting a goal: you need coverage. AMD has N22 for the 300-400 dollar market, and the 4060 TI 8GB hasn't really dropped enough in price to merit a large response (it's specs are also hilariously imbalanced). If the 4060 TI's drops to 330 and 380, respectively, and N22 is gone, AMD will need a response. When that happens, they'll likely balance N32 production between the SKU's more, which lets a price gap open up between them (maybe 400 for 7700 XT, 480 for 7800 XT)\n\nWe may see a late cycle 7700 with 48CU's, made from the collected dies too defective to be 7700 XT's (kind of like the 5600x3D). That and discounts will also counter Nvidia if they drop the 4060 16GB drop to 350 (if we get to that point, they're just gonna ol yeller the 8GB model lol). It'll also counter Intel, although jury's out on how good Battlemage will be.\n\nI understand that reviews are more based on objective value, but with context, it makes sense why the 7700 XT is 450. That being said, the 7900 XT and 7900 XTX had a proportionately identical price gap to these two cards, but they made a lot more of the cheaper one. My theory there is that it was up in the air on if the renamed 4080 12GB would get a price cut and they had too much N21 left.",
      "Yeah the 7700xt is almost certainly the price it is to sell off RDNA 2 stock.",
      "Pretty clear your best deals are at least 3-6 months after launch, if you don’t manage to get a flagship product for msrp at launch",
      "Prices will go down, but by then the $100 Starfield Premium promo will be long gone.  \n\n\nPossibly this promo will be replaced by something else, who knows (AMD is not always consistency with these promos), but whichever game it happens to be, it won't be as hyped as Starfield. Besides, it is unlikely to be a $100 Premium Edition - basic $60 editions of games is what we tend to get as bundles.  \n\n\nAnyway, I am just pointing this out. If someone is waiting for the 7700XT to go down by $50, but then they plan to buy Starfield, might as well pay $450 for the 7700XT (or get the 7800XT if they can find one).",
      ">You either buy the overpriced 7700 XT or you pay extra and buy the more expensive 7800 XT. It's a win-win either way for AMD.\n\nOr you decide to save some money and go for the 6800XT because it's such good value, and help AMD clear old stock they want gone. It's a win-win-win for AMD.",

Its very competitive vs Nvidia even at $450 so isn't completely DOA.  \nC.

    "selftext": "Hey all.\n\nI'm planning to upgrade from my current laptop (i5-2430M, Radeon HD 6470M, 8gb DDR3-1333) to something faster. Way faster.\n\nI'm torn between these two cards (RX 7700 XT and RX 6750 XT). I have heard something about the RX 7000 series being better for productivity than the RX 6000 series, I don't know if this is true.\n\nThe price difference between these two cards is 63 euro.\n\nI'm planning to use it for Unreal Engine, Unity, Godot and Blender. I don't know much about these programs since I have never used them before.\n\nDoes anyone know how much more the RX 7700 XT is better than the RX 6750 XT for game development and 3d work?",
    "comments": [
      "Between those two I'd say the 7700 XT is the better choice, but you can't go wrong with either. AMD cards will do fine in all of those but Nvidia is just superior in blender thanks to CUDA.  I've done unity dev work on a 6800 XT and it was perfectly fine. \n\nIn all honesty, except for blender your CPU matters more than your GPU with these tasks- Unity will use all the threads you can throw at it when compiling and if choosing the 6750 XT over the 7700XT gives you the budget to go for an 8-core chip instead of a 6-core chip, do it.\n\nThat being said i agree with the other commenter, a used RTX 3080 10GB is the best value in that price range right now. Those that work are well within the valley of the bathtub curve and you'll probably get at least 5 years out of a used one. (Just maybe avoid the zotac trinity model of the 3080 those are cheaper for a reason)",

      "Well productivity wise nvidia seems like your best bet. Although I don’t do any of these tasks and only game, so I went with AMD. But for productivity go for nvidia. Where are you from? 430 for a 3060 seems a bit steep imo.",
      "Less than you'd think. the biggest risk is the lack of warranty",
      "Bro Actually sometimes 7900xtx performs similar to 4060ti in Productivity so it will be better to research if AMD support those applications. It's all on your applications.",

      "LOL AMD used common sense where Nvidia saw none.",
      "> Is there anything wrong with the connector? Nope.\n\nA connector where Psu companies have to paint in order to let the user know that it is entirely in is not a suitable connector.\n\nStop smoking, because your brain is a fried as many 12vh connectors.",

      "Nah, we have seen folks test the connector pulling well over 1kw without issue. This is just a narrative redditors made up. \n\nThe root issue causing burnt connectors was addressed in a revision that reduces the chance of the cable pulling current when not fully inserted.",
      "Nvidia designed the original 12-pin connector that first appeared on RTX 30 series Founders Editions that would eventually evolve into 12VHPWR. Intel took Nvidia's 12-pin design and added the four sense pins to the connector for communication between the graphics card and the power supply for how much power needs to be supplied. Nvidia and Intel were the ones who actually designed the power connector. AMD's only role in the creation of 12VHPWR was that they are a member of PCI-SIG which nearly every technology company is, including Apple, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, HP, IBM. PCI-SIG has hundreds of members.",
      "consortium was planning to release it, while nvidia rushed and made their own version before the standard officially was out.",
      "I think it should've been designed with a 90-degree mounting option (or maybe that's 180-degrees, lol!), to lay on the back of GPU backplate, due to the strict wire bending guidelines the connector has. The connector housing could be designed in a way to fully capture the terminals so that they don't move and cause localized hotspotting and excess receptical-terminal strain.\n\nConnector should not be difficult to fully insert either.\n\nAll of these things should have been considered before allowing high current on effectively the same amount of 12V/GND wire pairs as 2x8-pins (6x 12V/GND pairs).",
      "the v2 of it seems good.",
      "Wasn't that just for the 3090 Ti? I thought all Ada GPUs didn't use the same connector and do use the one from the actual spec?",
      "I like the idea of 12VHPWR where a GPU can be powered with one cable and the sense pins allow the GPU to be aware of what power consumption can be handled by the power supply. The problem is that Nvidia for some bizarre reason tried to make the connector as small as a standard single 8-pin PCIe power connector. Trying to push 600W through such a tiny space leaves such little room for user error. The connector could have easily been slightly larger and chunkier, similar to 8-pins, with a definitive click when it is fully inserted and there would not have been as many problems with it as there have been.",
      "Yeah it's a sound idea to have a new connector, but when I had my 4070 I hated that connector with a passion. It felt like I had to break the damn card to unplug it and it never felt like it was \"in\" like you get with a normal 8 pin. Terrible experience.",
      "if nothing is wrong, why did it get a redesign and manufacturers try to make it better themselves?",
      "More people need to realize how cheap the power supply manufactures got with this. PCIe 8 pins carry a max of 150w so each one of them is designed to be physically capable of carrying 300w to ensure that they'll always be able to hit that 150w spec regardless of manufacturer tolerances. Maybe that's overengineered, but HPWR is designed to carry 600w so the cable is specced to carry... exactly 600w. \n\nAny hardware engineer worth a damn could have predicted that'd be a complete disaster that'd result in actual fires, and what do you know!",
      "Honestly what they should have done is built the connector as a split style design, much like the 20+4 atx or 4+4 12v cpu..\n\nNewer lower tier cards could use half of it with more than sufficient power delivery and the high tier cards use the full connector. And imo, concentrate it into more of a sqaurish block rather tna a long thin connector. Specially for including the sensing pins. Honestly the design of it looks like it was clearly engineered to meet napkin level math and application and takes ZERO consideration into real world use scenarios. The rule of thumb should always be, whatever the requirements are even after adding for some variables, double the reliability and strength capacity."

Navi 23 was released 5 month after Navi 22, 9 months after Navi 21.\n\nOn the other hand the 6600M XT (mobile Navi 23) was announced on the 31st of May 2021, so about 6 months after Navi 21 was released, while the 7600M XT (mobile Navi 33) was announced at CES this year, less than a month after Navi 31 was released, although this doesn't mean much for shipping.\n\nAnyway, that's the info.

Once these things come out it should be 100% obvious what's going to be a better value. As for definate performance regardless the RX 9070XT is going to better looking at it's specs.",
      "I like your answer. The original question was about which is a better value. We can't automatically assume the RX 9070XT will a better value until independent reviewers have results and we see actually sale's prices. These days MSRP means next to nothing. Just because the RX 9070XT on paper is a better GPU doesn't mean it's going to be a better value yet.",

      "I have no doubt Nvidias spin doctors in their PR are gunning for any negative story about a competitor I think we should remember it was AMDs own bad statement which fed the media frenzy with the original starfield FSR rumor.",
      "His \"source\" leak",
      "none of their sources or them \"confirmed\" that it will have fsr3 but they were essentially speculating since the timing of the announcement lined up so perfectly",
      "No, he speculated that it might be.  He did not claim that such a thing had been leaked to him.",
      "AMD's initial statement - to the Wccftech request - read to me like standard PR speak: Answering without answering, boasting while being noncommittal, etc. There were enough other red flags to the article that I felt comfortable simply brushing it off. It's a shame that media outlets didn't notice those other red flags, but whatever the case, AMD's NEXT response - a \"No comment.\" to Gamers Nexus's follow-up - is what really struck me as being a major PR misstep... even if in retrospect I can understand why they they chose to not comment.\n\nBut the media frenzy was already well under way by the time they said anything, and the media frenzy likely would have continued despite anything they said, because AMD seems to just perpetually occupy this nigh second-class citizen status in the gaming space. Gamers writ large have just been so conditioned and are all too willing to write their efforts off and/or uncritically accept whatever criticism is made of them.\n\nLike, the Wccftech article REALLY should have raised some eyebrows. Even re-reading it again now, I'm struck by how clearly slanted the language is, how poorly-written it is, how scant the evidence is, and I'm noticing again how it often uses the tactic of speaking on behalf of its audience. Phrases like \"...this leads to one of the biggest questions that most gamers have right now and that's the DLSS support in some of the biggest recent releases...\" and \"...it gives gamers a very clear message that NVIDIA-sponsored titles are friendlier and open to competitors than AMD.\" should have instantly given any reader, and ESPECIALLY any journalist, pause. That is not the language of a neutral third party. That is obviously loaded language being put to a specific purpose.",

It never ends.\n\nIt's why I basically don't listen to what people here say and just watch/read the sources directly.\n\nAs far as the FSR3 statement he made...he was basically spot on. In addition to the slide above, he merely said that it would be awesome if they did release it with Starfield but nobody told him that it would.",

      "You're conflating a lot of disparate things and drawing one unrelated conclusion from them. In short, you're doing bad data analysis, probably from a position of extreme ignorance.\n\n>Intel cards don't even work in Starfield,\n\nIntel cards are managing to boot the game, so they \"work,\" but they feature a lot of rendering bugs... which is hardly new to Intel cards. Their drivers and software suite have improved since launch, yes, that doesn't mean that Arc is suddenly not still a very experimental generation. Bugs are to be expected with Intel GPUs, growing pains are to be expected. you know that (or should know that) when you buy in.\n\n>and Nvidia cards are being underutilized\n\nIt stands to reason that AMD, who sponsored the title, would work with Bethesda to ensure the game has no speed bumps interacting with its hardware. All games hit different speed bumps with different hardware. That's what driver updates and game patches are for. In this case, AMD and Bethesda have simply \"pre-\"updated drivers and \"pre-\"patched the game to remove their specific speed bumps.\n\nThey didn't (or likely didn't, anyway) *create* any speed bumps for Nvidia hardware. AMD simply haven't helped Bethesda smooth the existing ones over. And Bethesda, because of the sponsorship, have simply bumped AMD speed bumps up to the top of the queue for fixing.\n\nSo it's not that Nvidia cards are being underutilized, but that 1) Bethesda may have deprioritized any Nvidia-specific fixes, and 2) Nvidia haven't had the chance to do its respective optimization passes. (And, according to MLID, the team within Nvidia responsible for driver development haven't received the budget to do so.)\n\n> let alone have XeSS, .... on top of not having DLSS.\n\nThe decision to implement a software feature - any software feature - is ultimately up to the developer (barring, of course, the possibility of contract stipulations).\n\nAdding XeSS and/or DLSS on the developer's side adds more work, even if the integration itself is relatively simple. QA, testing, etc. If there's one solution that works on all hardware, from a dev's standpoint, why wouldn't you want to use that? Simplifies the entire dev process.\n\nI'd even argue that it being so easy to mod in DLSS support is only MORE reason to just include FSR. You cover every single hardware solution in one go with an upscaling solution, you minimize the work you have to do, and the people who want DLSS can still use DLSS.\n\n>Meanwhile... the 7900XT 20GB beats the 4080,\n\n...which it has done on multiple occasions, just as the 4070 Ti has beaten the 7900 XTX on occasion. Heck, the 7900 XT can beat the 40***90*** in Call of Duty. Are you going to argue that AMD paid Infinity Ward to cripple Nvidia cards in CoD? Well, you might, but of course you'd be wrong."

      "It really comes down to the target resolution you play in as well as the types of games you play. If you're primarily playing esports games and want as many fps as possible, the 7700XT is probably the better choice. \n\nIf you're looking to play the latest and greatest, graphically intensive games it's impossible to match the value DLSS adds in regards to performance for such a slight quality loss and how prevelant it is. You can also use ray tracing on the 4060ti, which can make some series differences visually. Sure, FSR is available, but the visual quality isn't really close to DLSS, that may change with FSR 4, assuming it comes to the 7xxx GPUs and that's setting aside it's potential adoption rate. \n\nCurrently FSR 3 is the best offering AMD has, and while it's been available for a while now, it's not uncommon for games to still ship with FSR 2.xx still while DLSS is generally available in the majority of new or major releases. \n\nFrame generation comes with both benefits and negatives, while I have a 40xx series GPU I tend to opt not to use it regardless. Before that, I used to mod FSR frame generation into games to use with my 3070ti, mostly to see what the hype was about",

After 1 year, the monitor starting randomly powering off, and then it started taking longer and longer to power on (probably bad caps).  \n3. RMA'd it to Acer (it had a 2 year warranty). 1 month later I got the monitor back and it worked for 6 months before it failed exactly the same way again. So I RMA'd it again.  \n4. Another month later, a brand new 1920x1080 23.5\" TN panel that was selling for $350 shows up with terrible viewing angles, awful color reproduction, and response times no better than the P-MVA panel I sent in. Contacted Acer and told them it was not what I paid for, what they sent me is unusable junk, and I either want the panel I bought repaired and returned to me, or I want a full refund. They responded that they had no replacements available, they were sorry, and that their customer service would be contacting me to work something out.\n\nI never heard from them, they stopped responding to my e-mails, and I got hung up on several times when I tried (politely, mind) talking to them on the phone. That was the first and last time I ever bought an Acer product.\n\nI've since dealt with Acer a few more times for clients, but those are different stories (and it only went marginally better).",

      "Definitely think the 7700 XT @ $400 would have been a huge home run.\n\nAt $450, you got better options for a small increase, as TUP's conclusion reads.\n\nOh well, AMD gonna AMD. When the inevitable price cuts hit, the 7700 XT will be a decent recommendation as old RDNA2 dries up.",
      "Techpowerup really are the best reviews by far. Great charts if you just want performance numbers, but well written analysis if you're interested.",
      "My only complaints with this release is that I wish each respect card was $50 less and that the 7800 XT dropped the XT as the naming scheme is a little misleading. \n\nThat said, they’re occupying a market that Nvidia doesn’t currently command, and asking for a price reduction is probably asking a little too much from AMD in 2023. \n\nSolid release, just in time for one of the biggest games of the year.",
      "AMD is basically encouraging consumers to buy the 7800XT and the suckers who buy the 7700XT at MSRP are a bonus. So yeah, always wait for the price to go down.\n\nI hate the current state of the consumer GPU market...",
      "Something I like about them, and most tech review sites as a whole, is that they don't vomit Javascript/Angular everywhere and make the site run like ass on phones.\n\nSwitching from reading a Techspot article to say, a CNN one is night and day.",
      "Is there already a review for the 7800XT Pulse out there? Tempted by the card, but would like to know more about how good the cooler is.",
      "At 399, this will be the value card king. Black Friday time maybe?",
      "Thank you <3",
      "I just got this card (Pulse 7800xt) and it is great! GPU temps are in the low 60s (I didn't look at the hotspot temps). It's also very quiet. I can't hear it over the other fans in my system. The cooler is impressive, especially since it's only a dual fan setup.",
      "I would have preferred if they used Cyberpunk RT for testing OC. 3DMark benchmarks are very skewed for RDNA3 GPU OCs and don't tell the full story (e.g. my 7900xtx can run them at 1020mv but games typically need 1100mv).",
      "It costs $50 more than the $400 you are asking, and it comes with a free $100 game.",
      "If the 7700 was priced closer to (or at) $400, I'd be all over it to replace my 5700XT.",
      "Probably much sooner since Nvidia dropped the price of the 4060Ti to undercut this card.",
      "I think because I had to sit out the 6000/RTX30 series and scalpers, I have no issue with the current market. My 4080 cost me less than the 2080 ti it replaced, offers huge improvements and I didn't have to fight scalpers.\n\nBut everyone is different. AMD is definitely going to try to maximize profits, and they should, but consumers should do everything in their best interest.",
      "Not that I've seen. I bought it though and judging from the 7700XT Pulse review, I'd expect identical performance to the stock version of 7800XT but better temps and noise. I can post what I've got once the card arrives.",
      "I assume there's not enough defective dies to have enough supply for a 400 dollar 7700 XT, yet.",
      "As I mentioned it wouldn't. In case you didn't see what TPU said, you need to undervolt to get higher clock speeds for RDNA3. This also means Timespy can get insane gains from a unrealistic undervolt, because it somehow still runs at ultra low voltage, yet for gaming you're only stable at around 1080\\~1100 mv at best. Vex did a test with 15% PL, and it was only like a 5% fps increase. I'd bet there's another 4\\~5% from gain undervolting which he failed to realize since he didn't understand the architecture. It's probably only 10% better at best which is still insane imo as an OC.",
      "Same results with me. Temps hover around 60-62C during gameplay, my case fans are louder than the GPU so can't complain about that. Upgraded from 5700XT Red Dragon so getting generally near double fps with what little testing I've seen. No coil whine either.\n\nThis is with default settings, haven't tried undervolting yet.",
      "Now we wait for NVidia to undercut it so we can get it at $400, oh how the turntables /s",
      "Yeah, curious to see what the pricing does in the coming weeks/months. I can wait a couple months before buying a new system, i wouldn't be surprised if the price on these drops in that timeframe."

I'm not sure if HYPR-RX will release at the same time or if it will be launched ahead of that feature. There's also \"Anti-Lag+\" to be included with HYPR-RX, but it sounds like AMD doesn't want to talk about that yet. Based on the name, we can presume it is their competitor to nvidia Reflex.\n\nThe GPUs will launch on September 6th. FSR 3 is going to be rolling out on a per game basis like any other upscaler, starting with Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum in a few weeks.\n\n[Here](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-amd-reveals-long-awaited-fsr-3-tech-and-frame-gen-for-every-dx11dx12-game) is an article that fills in some gaps that the live stream left. Based on this report, HYPR-RX may be RDNA 3 exclusive, but FSR 3 was out-right stated to be supported on any GPU including consoles.\n\nEDIT: HYPR-RX is reportedly coming to RDNA 3 on Sept. 6 with the launch drivers for 7700XT/7800XT. AFMF will be added later though. It's still unclear to me if Anti-Lag+ will be part of HYPR RX at launch.\n\nThere's also come discussion on FSR3 requirements. Some reports are saying that only GPUs past a certain release date will be able to use, that it is available to any GPU brand and not necessarily any GPU. Supposedly that is RDNA1 or equivalent. I've seen some sites report that could mean GTX 900 or later, it depends, but for sure RTX 2000 or later and results on RDNA 2 and 3 will be better than RDNA 1."

That is not a great showing for RDNA3.\n\nI could probably find some redeeming things to say about the 7700 XT if it launched at $399.

      "> Could enabling or an auto pbo and also setting a static core freq cancel each other out? \n\nYou are telling it to do two contradictory things, what did you expect?\n\nNever set a fixed frequency on modern CPUs, it is either going to cripple your performance or destroy the CPU in a brief period of time if you raised voltage to set anything close to full speed.\n\nReset it and leave it at stock, if you dont know what you are doing. It will boost to full speed by itself if cooled.",
      "It’s on a per core basis from what I understand. Ryzen 7000 will boost the highest performing core by default and PBO will push it further for longer. \n\nWhen you enable CO, you can select an all core or per core curve. I typically do all core and adjust a negative offset until I hit instability (governed by my weakest core).",
      "And am I chasing something pretty irrelevant in wanting an all core static oc with these processors.\n\nWhen I was on Intel you wanted to chase that static all core for performance usually.",
      "Yes you are. No need to static overclock as the best performance in most use cases is through using \"dynamic overlock\" which is another word for PBO.",
      "I’d recommend making the changes in the BIOS instead of with in Ryzen Master. Also, make sure you’re setting a NEGATIVE offset. It’s counter intuitive but the goal is to pull the boost voltage down so the CPU runs cooler, which will give more headroom for the boost algorithm.",
      "Make sure precision boost overdrive is enabled in the BIOS and maybe add a negative offset with curve optimizer. You’ll have to do a bit of trial and error to find what’s stable.",
      "Cinebench just has each core do a static render so it pushes each core to its highest.  In games cores have ALWAYS boosted to different speeds depending on what it is required to do.\n\nIt sounds like you want to use the most electricity that you can just to have the cores sit at the highest boost clock. Maybe stop looking at the core clock speed to help with any OCD.",
      "I have enabled pbo. Have not run curve optimizer yet though",
      "I ran cinebench last night, and my results compare to yours.  I was hitting 95c temp though…\n\nCurve optimizer gave me a -50 offset and a max of 5.5ghz, but obviously I need better cooling",
      "CS:GO is a CPU limited game. At those framerates, you're finding physical limitations in terms of latency within the hardware. It's shocking that the game engine can even run framerates that high, as normally games simply can't do that. Even 2D games have a limit; there is a minimum amount of processing that must occur between frames, and that takes time.",
      "Because it’s cheaper, uses less power, has included decent cooler, and performs almost on par with the x.\n\nI didn’t buy it with the intention of overclocking it, but reviews said it does overclock well.  Reviews also said they were able to all core overclock to 5.3 with stock prism cooler.\n\n I haven’t been able to get it to all core overclock when gaming (it did on cinebench R23) so I was posing questions to see if I was missing something, not asking for buying advice.  I did put a bunch of time into research and deciding between Intel and amd, and the ability to overclock amd led me this way. \n\nI’ve been out of the hardware loop for 5-6 years now.",
      "CO is a good tool to pull the voltage frequency curve down so for a given frequency the CPU will apply less voltage. On Ryzen 7000 you can squeeze more frequency out of it since it’ll use less voltage and in turn less heat. The tricky thing is to find a negative offset that is still stable for all core workloads.",
      "this. turn PBO on, static freq off, but set PBO boost offset to +200",
      "So- I used Windows PowerShell to enable the Ultimate Power plan for my PC, It’s typically hidden but you can find the command line options to enable it, I then deleted the other power plans to prevent Windows 11 from reverting back to the balanced mode. \n\nI’m not totally sure if it really does anything other than preventing hard drives from hibernating. But I figured why not.",
      "Not sure if this still holds true, but PBO is more for all core workloads, where actual overclocking is more for single threaded apps.  I personally just use auto-overclock.  But might depend more on which chip you have.",
      "If you have a non-X CPU, then your BIOS settings should look like these:\n\nPPT = 88 (W), TDC = 75 (A), EDC = 150 (A). For a TDP of 65W.\n\n*(in some BIOSes it can be 88000 instead of 88, so be careful with the units)*\n\nYou can try these settings:\n\nPPT = 142 (W), TDC = 110 (A), EDC = 170 (A). For a TDP of 105W.\n\nThat should basically turn your 7700 non-X into a 7700X. Like I said, 40% more power draw, but only for a marginal performance increase.\n\nMaybe you can go even further, but all that is of course at your own risk, and you'll need a good cooler, possibly better than the Wraith Prism.\n\nOne last thing: before attempting this, it would be wise to restore BIOS to default settings.\n\nGood luck!\n\n|TDP & Stock PBO Settings|PPT (W)|TDC (A)|EDC (A)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|45 W|61|65|140|\n|65 W|88|75|150|\n|95 W|128|100|160|\n|105 W|142|110|170|\n|125 W|162|120|180|\n|170 W|230|160|225|",
      "Overclocking on ryzen is nowhere near the same as on intel cpus. Just do all core curve optimizer with a negative voltage offset. You get more performance out of tuning your RAM than you do getting higher clocks. Also getting all cores to boost to the same frequency is meaningless.",
      "Oh perfect. I actually just went and learned how to format tables in Discord after reading your post to share and pin the information for some others. Thanks for taking the time to make this!",
      "Could enabling or an auto pbo and also setting a static core freq cancel each other out? \n\nI belive pbo is functioning correctly in the chip, as I do get some boosts.  Does pbo for you clock all cores the same?",
      "So in CSGO im not reaching 100% gpu usage, usually hovering around 80 or so… I think my \"insecurity\" is that i feel the 7700 should be able to feed my 7900xt 100% for this game in 1440p… maybe im misguided in that thought…\n\n\nYes I have framerate uncapped.  cpu wattage right now with running pbo at stock settings is between 35-45 watts while playing."

      "Just wrote this to AMD after getting pushback from both Newegg and Sapphire about the Starfield not being included.  Still awaiting AMD reply:   \n\"Hello, I just purchased new release PURE AMD Radeon™ RX 7800 XT 16GB yesterday from Newegg (which is a consumer authorized merchant partner for Sapphire as well as most of your AMD graphics cards.) According to all marketing from AMD as well as the Sapphire website: https://www.sapphiretech.com/en/consumer/pure-radeon-rx-7800-xt-16g-gddr6 , this graphics card qualifies for the Starfield Premium edition bundle. I already wrote to Newegg, and they said it does not qualify. Reading the Sapphire website disclaimer, it states \"Available through participating retailers only.\" Newegg is definitely a participating retailer, as they are showing this Starfield bundled with other 7800 XT brands (ASRock, etc...). Also, since the Sapphire website here shows the 7800 XT as a qualified graphics card, and the only place for a consumer (non commercial) to purchase this specific Sapphire 7800 XT, by default this would have to be a participating and qualified purchase. Sapphire summarily wrote back to me to contact you at AMD directly, as AMD is handling the Starfield game code distribution. I could almost understand the participating vendors disclaimer if there were multiple storefronts offering the Sapphire 7800 XT, however Newegg is the only storefront for consumer purchase. So with one default storefront, combined with the Sapphire 7800 XT as a qualified graphics card, this purchase on Newegg has to qualify, since Newegg is a participating merchant.\"",

Games now run pretty well on 4 physical + 4 logical threads. But then again, games used to run fine on one thread. Then two threads. Now 4 threads. Wait, now the i5 is getting beaten by the i7, make that 8 threads...\n\nSome of the 1080ti reviews already show Ryzen beating the 7700k because it ends up being a CPU bottleneck on total throughput. To an extent, games do generate additional operations for the CPU as resolution and settings are dialed up. Consider shadows, particle effects, physics, etc. Some of this work is done by the CPU, varying in degree by engine. These tasks are often parallelizable, so Ryzen should have a big advantage with such work. And we are already seeing it.\n\nLow settings, low resolution to check for CPU bottlenecking is horseshit, IMO, since that really only tests the main game loop and none of the auxiliary work.\n\nNow I'm REALLY laughing my ass off at the people who cancelled their Ryzen/AM4 orders and insta-switched to 7700k cookie cutter builds.",

But the big issue is, the 13600k is 53% faster in MT. The MT gap is simply too big to care about the marginal gaming difference, it reminds me of early Ryzen, where the 1800x was a moderately slower in gaming than the 7700k, but dominated it in MT. Consumers dont ignore such a big MT difference even if gaming is weaker, and that big MT gap is what sold early Ryzen CPUs.",

That alone compensates for the price increase of lower tier DDR5, there's also the matter of the benchmarks always comparing like-for-like as opposed to people buying 13600K and running it on cheaper DDR4 for the maxdimum price advantage, where I assume performance will favour the cheaper 7700 much more. I'd honestly like to see a 'cheap' 13600 system (i.e. not 4000+Mhz RAM) compared to an AM5 system, instead of people pointing at the 13600 dominating somewhat on a DDR5 system where the total platform costs are much closer to AM5 anyway.",

ALD still holds up better against Zen 4 than Zen 3 does in gaming.\n\n>BTW AMD also have low-end productivity chips that could get 75-80% gaming perf at good price-to-MT perf ratio... it's called AM4.\n\nAnd Intel i5s will offer better/similar gaming performance and better MT at the same price point than AM4 as well.\n\nNow what?",

      "> In the UK 7600X is £320 and the 13600K is £380 ($436!). \n\nThe UK is a special place. Because they had the \"event\" affecting the GBP between Zen pricing was set and RPL launch. With the pound recovering you can expect Intel pricing to come down in a few weeks/months.\n\nThe situation you describe exists essentially nowhere else in Europe. Here in Sweden the 13600KF is cheaper than the 7600X and the 13600K is like 10-15 bucks more. Over at Caseking in Germany the 7600X and 13600K are both €359 (slightly less than the UK price for the 7600X) and the 13600K is €389 (€ to $ is nearly 1:1)\n\nAnd before someone comes with the \"at mindfactory the 7600X is just €349\"\n\nWell, [13600KF Tray at €342](https://www.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/Intel-CORE-i5-13600KF-TRAY_1471141.html)",

And that is assuming board+RAM pricing is the same, but in reality it currently favors Intel.",

      "> while 7600X is 13% higher than 12900K \n\nAnd perhaps you should use aggregate data, rather than the reviewer on the whole net that posts the best AMD results because of his testing setup and choice of games. Two can play this game, I could take TPU results and show you how the 7600X is [slower than a 12600K at 720p](https://tpucdn.com/review/intel-core-i9-13900k/images/relative-performance-games-1280-720.png)\n\nThe truth lies somewhere in between. HWUB is one extreme, TPU is close to the other. The 7600X stock is roughly as good as a 12900K with stock DDR5 and a bit faster if the ALD has stock DDR4. But 12900K has the benefit of gaining A LOT from memory, be it DDR4 or DDR5. \n\n>In Hardware Unboxed review (1080p gaming), 13900K has 8% higher gaming perf than 7600X, while 7600X is 13% higher than 12900K and 17% higher than 12700K with DDR4. Meanwhile, 12700K with DDR4 is just 6% faster than 5950X in gaming.\n\nHWUB DDR4 DRAM benchmarks are in general worthless. After the used G2 at 4000MHz on locked ALD chips rather than just running at 3800/3900 G1, he lost the last shred of credibility he had in that department. His results are also all over the place, with some ALD chips scaling better than others with \"the same RAM\" and game/settings, great consistency there!\n\nSteve is also benching with the questionable hand picked, provided by AMD DDR5 kit from the review package iirc. If Intel had sent specific 7000Mhz+ kits to test RPL with, what would this community have said then? You would have been screaming about bloody murder. AMD does not support 6000MHz DDR5 fyi. Either test at stock or with memory you sourced yourself at reasonable \"max settings\", anything else is just trying to shift the narrative in whichever direction.",

    "selftext": "I got a [build list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4YYmvj) ready for my PC. Now, something I realized the other day was that I needed to make it a priority to get a new monitor too, and that cuts into my budget - I'm trying to shave a few hundred off wherever I can, and I'm wondering if the RTX 4070 Super I so wanted is what has to go.\n\nFrom [this benchmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgBO2ScltgM) it looks like the 7700XT gets about 80-90% of the performance on average, for about 60% of the cost, at least for non-ray tracing. That makes it seem like the least painful way to trim my build cost - I should still be happy with the GPU for years, and I can upgrade it if needed down the line.\n\nI do have some questions though.\n\n1: I know that AMD cards are worse at ray tracing per dollar than Nvidia. However, I only plan to use ray tracing for the novelty - I'm not sold on it being vital to the gaming experience. Can I expect to run ray traced games at 1080p 30FPS on high settings? As long as I can test it out for a few hours without it being painful to look at, I'm satisfied on that front.\n\n2: I saw in a very old thread something about AMD being more prone to needing troubleshooting than Nvidia is. Is there any truth to that still in 2024?\n\n3: Is there anything else you think might be helpful for me to know?\n\nBonus question about general PC building - are there other parts in this build list that I could change out to save more to go towards the monitor and peripherals, without being much of a performance loss?\n\nBonus question 2: if I don't buy a Windows 11 activation key immediately and just use the free version for a month or so, what limitations would that impose?\n\nBonus question 3: I DO want my PC to look nice. Between [case 1](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QnD7YJ/fractal-design-pop-air-atx-mid-tower-case-fd-c-poa1a-02) and [case 2](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3nD7YJ/fractal-design-pop-air-atx-mid-tower-case-fd-c-por1a-01), which do you personally think would look better with black internals? I like the idea of RGB fans in an otherwise no-RGB build, just as an accent, but I'm not sure whether the white case on black internals would \"pop\" or if it would clash. Also, how can I verify that the parts I pick fit inside the case, alongside a [support bracket for the GPU](https://www.amazon.com/Graphics-Brace-Support-Holder-Bracket/dp/B09FPJL1KY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=22N6M82BND9DR&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Y0Ec4wY79HC-EUw6I9gqsmIn4fTWGAyDbE0TrshyDOeoFEwowCxGl4_g4XBy7HEziikoVIAbHXnN9dY4nRyQ94VQYGSHwMA_fSiLsSEnBP9_90BHLq6Xl92-D5MG8MMyQ97XsEk4yePU_2q6jaNl-8g89uFe8Rzq9X5p_TTqg8FdipCmWIoaQziYDdaQtr5VGEGRDrwwPToXjtwM-sbOZLJNqyivx8d7nkAW9ZBk6Wg.Nk4YIqzP0R40yA1jju8ZPwVgIdHp0k7fzbVp1UaYwNw&dib_tag=se&keywords=gpu%2Bsupport%2Bbracket&qid=1709404390&sprefix=gpu%2Bsuppo%2Caps%2C262&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1)?\n\nAnyway, I don't have a hard limit on what my budget is - I have about $1100 USD set aside for this right now, and I'm not willing to make the cuts to fit that budget for a PC/monitor/some other peripherals, therefore I'm gonna need to set aside a portion of my check every month for a while.

I'm not sure there's any data out there to quantify whether or not AMD is more prone to troubleshooting than Nvidia. I personally have had less problem with nvidia cards than AMD. But my experience is anecdotal and not necessarily representative of the experience you will have with your hardware.

No regrets, its like 2.5-3x the performance uplift for me and I paid the same cost as I did for my new 1070 6 years ago.",

The clockspeeds arent much higher and at the same clock getting 9% more perf. on average for doubling the fp32 part of the CU is insanely innefficient.",

It is as if RDNA2 never managed to catch up to NVIDIA.\n\nHow much worse can marketing be ffs...",

      "Yeah, although I think that was more because they didn't plan on bringing that particular die over until the shortages were becoming severe.\n\nImo they should have just called it the 6500 or even 6400 and called the 6400 the 6200 or something.",

      "No it was a used mining card. I was skeptical at first because I never bought a used card before but after looking into it, and how mining cards are usually in better condition (because less heat cycles), I decided it was worth the risk to skip this terrible gen. No regrets, card runs perfect and very cool. Getting a 6900xt over a 6800 non-xt was just lucky. Although either of these cards will be perfect for 1440p for years with the 16gb vram."

This price affects the products down the stack as well, what's the 9070 going to be priced at? 20% less than the xt? That's close to a 5070, and the general consumer market would just buy the 5070 anyway because of the brand\n\nThese performance numbers, are somewhat impressive, but then if the price is still just 100$ off Nvidia, it's good as dead.",

With 5070Ti barely in stock and at $900+ when it is, the 9070XT at a rumored $650 would be a STEAL. Even at MSRP $750, 9070XT would be a good deal at $650, but no higher.",

Despite the spec sheet for 7900, they could reached close to 2.9Ghz as well in gaming.",

      "Interesting, still waiting to replace my 1070ti for 1440p gaming. Undecided between 9070 XT or 5070 TI, definitely need at least the 16GB of ram for some future proofing. The 5070 regular sucks.",
      "All the missing compute units agains the 7900XT are replaced with clocks. So that is the bottom line. Now it remains to be seen how the architectural improvements impacts performance.",
      "I'm also waiting to decide between these two cards, my focus is raster performance in 1440p gaming.",
      "keep in mind that historically the higher CU count does not scale very well with AMD. If you compare 7800XT with 7900XTX thats 60% more CU but results only in 44% higher performance. 7900XT has 40% more CU and 28% more performance. The sweetspot always seems to be around 64 CU (Scaling from 7700XT to 7800XT is way more linear).\n\nAlso RDNA3 used Chiplets while RDNA4 is monolithic. Performance might be 5-10% shy of an XTX. It comes down to architectural changes and if the chip is not memory starved.",
      "I bet AMD did something to make these additional ALUs more useful. Something like adding more register space and extending the types of instructions the second set can perform to allow for single-cycle Wave64 execution more often.\n\nHaving less CUs also means having less scheduling overhead btw. I believe one of the reasons the command processor in flagship RDNA3 clocked higher than the shaders was because of such overhead.\n\nAnyways, the rumored 390mm² seem considerably large for a die with just 64CUs and a 256bit memory interface. Something in that chip is needing tons of space and I don't think it's the fixed-function units or shaders (although the latter are probably less dense than usual to allow for higher clock speeds).\n\nI can't wait to see the architecture reveal and test results from reviewers - I love seeing how these technical aspects affect performance.",

      "Are 7900xt/xtx even the right comparisons? These are the lower end of rdna4 reworked to be suitable stand-ins until udna. Aren’t they even monolithic like rdna2 and small rdna3?",

If it hits 7900xt levels of performance with better ray tracing for 600 then idk I guess that's a win.

Really it should have been 400 at most it would have gotten really good reviews at like 350-380. The 7800xt and the 7900gre were the only rdna 3 cards that had a decent launch price I think.\n\n\nThe sales since then have been pretty good with the 7900xt especially but the launch prices have really hurt amd imo I think it costs them money and pisses off consumers at the same time. The current people deciding the pricing structure have zero idea what good reviews and word of mouth marketing is worth. They are picking up pennies and losing dollars with the high release price strategy. Ironically Nvidia is the one who should be doing that on the 90 tier cards but they don't.

Otherwise, their dGPU stuff is non-existent almost. It's so hard to find an RX 7600S laptop versus a 4060 one for example. I mean what do you expect? They're doing the bare minimum in GPU and sometimes Intel is upstaging them like with XeSS.\n\nTired of seeing these threads... \"Oh wow the 7800 XT sold 1,000 more units at Mindfactory than the 4070, surely AMD is winning!\" /s\n\nI wonder what the next thread will be \"7900 XT outsells the 4080 SUPER at Mindfactory\".

      "Still not cheap enough.",
      "7800 XT is well priced, though would've been great if it had been that at launch, when fewer people cared about RT",
      "Not in EU lol\n\nIts still 1100$ and 4080S 1200$.....",
      "Meh, the 6800 XT was already sub-$500 when the 7800 XT launched. For minimal performance gain and a 3-year release gap, being the same price was crap. 10% off a year later also sucks.",
      "Another week another AMD consumer end price cut, luckily the economy is doing great and they're a data center company now...\n\nRight ?",
      "Oh look, the Nvidia fanboys are here already claiming the cards are still too expensive.\n\nWeird that I don't see that for the 4080 selling at 1050-1200 still and the 4090 going above 2000 again.\n\nI wonder how much Nvidia pays in marketing lol",
      "Always the same, US prices are without tax.",
      "I use two 7800xt in my ai home labs and they’re so, so good. \n\nWorth every penny.",
      "I think it’s odd that there was a brief window to preorder a Sapphire 7900xtx for around $830 soon after launch (with rebate) when the 4080 was going for $1300.  And the 7800X3D cpus were everywhere at list price (or cheaper at Microcenter). \n\nNow after all this time the price -just- drops to $850? And the X3D is sold out selling for higher? This has been such a weird cycle. The only time when the smart value move was to buy a video card and CPU at launch instead of waiting. This is so messed up.",
      "Amd is just being too stingy with their price cuts. It's absurd to me that they would rather price drop the 7900 xt to 660 one day, then the next day they drop it to 650. They need to stop playing games and just give them reasonable price cuts instead of just moving the needle slightly every day. It doesn't surprise me that nobody wants to buy amd gpus at this price, just give us reasonable prices and people would be interested.",
      "These prices are still pretty ass ngl. We're at the end of a product cycle for amd gpus. Nobody is really gonna want a mid level previous gen card when they can just wait a few months to buy current gen and the 7900 xtx is way too overpriced. Realistically it needs to hit at least 750 if not around the 700 for people to consider.",
      "AMD shot themself in the foot in a way that not even Nvidia did by having the 6800 XT available at essentially the same price and performance of the 7800 XT new. The 4060 Ti was marginally worse than the 3070 but about $100 (20%) cheaper. Both suck because they’re not offering what’s worth an upgrade Gen over Gen but AMD was particularly shitty with the 7800 XT.",
      "how much do you people think taxes are like srsly 849 x 1.2 is not $1100 and that's on the higher side of sales taxes 💀",
      "Exactly this.... Just that they are missing that Nvidia is restricting supplies to hike prices again 😂😂😂\n\nNvidia and discounts dont exist lol",
      "6800 XT is not available in most markets, it's been a clearance product for 2 years now",
      "Nvidia's bullshit isn't justification for AMD's. They can both eat crap for this generation.",
      "People have been calling Nvidia cards overpriced since they launched. The 4090 at $2000 is just atrocious but at least it has value in ML applications. The 4080 super being $1200 is just shocking. \n\nThat doesn't stop the AMD cards also being overpriced also",
      "I'm not surprised that we got another price cut tbh. This is like the 3rd or 4th price cut this week. They have a lot of old inventory just sitting on the shelves that no one is buying. On top of zen 5 flop amd is desperate to sell people anything. Their 3rd and 4th quarter earnings for 2024 are gonna be horrendous.",
      "Well idk what they mean with not in the EU, because you can get a XTX for 880 euro in the Netherlands, which is 966 dollars, and that's with much higher taxes than in every US state.",
      "EOL is end of life - no more support. They will be supported for years. The term that you’re looking for is EOS - end of sale. Like the 6900 XT before it discounts will come until stock is gone. Time to make room for next gen."

      "Navi 31 is terrible for AMD. The cost and complexity is just not good from a business point of view. It's done.\n\nExpect AMD to abandon it ASAP like Radeon VII and replace it with something slightly lower in performance like Navi 5700XT.",
      "Yeah, no way its going to match the 7900XTX.     \n96cu vs 64cu.     \n384bit memory bus vs 256.    Both using GDDR6 so cant really compensate with much faster ram. \n\nHopefully it matches 7900XT, but imho a more realisticly place would be somewhere between 7900GRE and 7900XT."

      "Yes, while consuming ~30-40W less power.",
      "The 6800 XT is a pretty big step up and isn’t that much more. It’s not as good of a value proposition as the others.",
      "the really ugly one is going to be 7700, where you're using almost as much N6 wafer area as a 7600 and then adding 200mm2 of N5P.  The MCM area overhead is atrocious.\n\nSo basically take a 7600 and then add three Zen4 chiplets worth of area, to slide performance upwards from 4060 to 4060 Ti performance.  Which it should edge past pretty easily ofc (4060 ti + 5-10%?) but it's gonna be a godawful deal for AMD.  Like I guess if it's 10% faster than 4060 Ti 8GB they do $429?  What an absolute waste of silicon from their perspective.  \n\nThere literally is not a number where that product is worthwhile - even at $499 it would be a waste of silicon for AMD compared to Zen chiplets.  And 7800 really needed to be sold for at least $600.  But the product performance just can't justify that.  This is Vega 2.0 where AMD is getting pinched by how poorly their silicon is performing relative to the established performance levels of the competition, and even AMD can't pretend it's an awesome deal at MSRP, but neither can they afford to go any lower on pricing.\n\nThat was when we saw the bundle deals (\"buy a GPU for $100 more than MSRP and get a coupon for $100 off a specific monitor nobody wants absolutely free, coupon expires in 30 days!\") and other crap kick in to shift ASPs upwards.  And even still, standalone MSRP was so low that partners couldn't actually make a profit on the cards they were ordering from AMD (\"made by AMD\" reference cards).  Everyone got real mad about that with NVIDIA a year ago, I think everyone forgot that was an AMD thing with Vega too lmao.\n\nI think the numbers have to be $499 for 7800 and $399 for 7700, *maybe* they will try for $529/$429 to squeeze a couple more bucks but at $450/$550 they are DOA.  DLSS alone is worth 10% to me.",
      "Cheapest 4080 I see right now is $1140. Cheapest XTX is $960 looking on Amazon and Newegg. So for $180 more I get a significantly more efficient card with better RT, DLSS3, and CUDA. Wouldn't be a hard decision for me to go for the 4080 if I was deciding between the two.\n\nAMD is delusional with their pricing this gen or maybe they just don't care and know they won't sell much at their current prices and are ok with it as long as the profit margins are high.\n\nNvidia is also delusional with their pricing this gen but at least they have a good line of cards and people justify paying more for the better features.",

      "So mostly the same performance to last gen but costs slightly less and consumes less power",

      "I'm guessing most people expected a better generational uplift over the 6800XT.",
      "I know the price is okay in the USA, but here in Australia, it's not that great. \n\nA 7800 XT the cheapest I can find as of writing is $879 AUD, that's converted to USD with tax included ~$561 USD which is about right once you add 10% GST/VAT and maybe some extra fees for being shipped to a penal colony. \n\nThe cheapest 4070 is like $889 AUD. So yeah the 4GB of VRAM extra is nice, but the RT performance, DLSS and other features like NVIDIA Broadcast and just general driver stability or rendering performance keep the RTX 4070 lingering around as an option. The $100 pricing gap between the 7800 XT and the 4070 in the USA is basically not really a thing here.\n\nThe 7800 XT desperately needs a price drop here in Australia to be a relevant purchase. A good $80 AUD price drop puts the 7800 XT into a spot of consideration. But then I remember that a used 6800 XT goes for around $650 AUD, so unless you really use RT or want AV1 can't see a reason to buy a 7800 XT.\n\nAnother AMD graphics card release, another dead on arrival product here in Australia.",

Same performance as last gens card something I have not seen on either nvidia or amds side in so long but hey. It's just $15 more expensive than last gens card so that's good ? Maybe...? I'm so fucking upset how did we get to this? Maybe by the time we get a 9800xt it might be a slight improvement who knows",
      ">it's $499 and runs as fast as a 4070\n\nSure, that's one way to look at it.  The other way is that it runs like a 6800XT for the price of a 6800XT.  Not saying that's bad (at least compared to the competition), just not very exciting.  People want generational uplift and this has essentially none.  If you have a mid-range or better card from last generation, there is nothing for you here.",
      "I just bought one after looking at the reviews. Also an important point is that 6800xt performance uplift via drivers is likely not going to happen anymore but 7800xt is likely going to get quite a few driver updates that improve performance. \n\nPlus I have seen reviews from 3 different sources running sometimes the same games and where Steve was getting better performance on the 6800xt the other two were getting equal or better performance on 7800xt. \n\nImportant thing to note, Steve was running the stock version of 7800xt vs sapphire nitro+ version of 6800xt. Jayztwocents was running the same version of two cards(red devil powercolor) and 7800xt was showing better results vs 6800xt. \n\nAnd I was hoping for exactly this, similar performance for less power draw and same price or cheaper. And it is in UK same price or cheaper.",
      "In theory, yes. But honestly modern cards tend to really struggle with OC's compared to older cards. The way they boost is just pretty aggressive out of the box. I think very few people get meaningful OC's on any 5000/6000/7000 series cards.",

There is a performance gap with the 4060Ti so they could charge it higher, but with the memory deficit it would be hard to justify.\n\nThe 7800XT is really in a weird place though. 499 USD could be really good. 549 would be meh.",
      "Specs on the 7700 XT look better than expected. The fact that they are positioning it against the 16GB 4060 Ti, a $500 card, doesn't bode well for the price though.",

They are comparing the 7700XT to the 4060Ti 16GB, so $449 for 7700XT is more in line with that.\n\nEDIT after the prices were announced:  \n$499 for the 7800XT seems OKish, but $449 for the 7700XT is ROFL pricing. It says in EU the prices will be 549 es 489 respectively and right now you can still get the 6800 for 459 and 489EUR which seems like a significantly better option than the 7700XT.",

A 7700xt at 429 or something with 6800XT level of performance.\n\n7600XT at 299 with 6700xt level of performance. That way even if there is no performance improvement you reduce the prices low enough that lower tier cards can enjoy higher tier of performance for the same cost.",

Sure no one with a 6800XT would “upgrade” to a 7800XT, but if they price it exactly at or above what the 6800XT is available at right now, then why did those “new people” wait? \n\nThe answer is they were waiting for 6800XT performance for 6700XT price or less, because that’s the precedent for the past decade or more. Improving energy efficiency and keeping the price the same while shouting “INFLATION!” isn’t good enough to justify these cards’ existence - especially not when RAM chip prices are way down, AMD is building these on a mature previous gen node, and while they’re not breaking record profits, they’re still more than profitable and being down 18-20% from the COVID spike is misleading at best. \n\nIf the XTX had simply been the 7900 XT and everything else got bumped down a tier, this lineup would look great. A 7700XT (current 7800XT) with the performance of a 3080 12GB or 6800 XT for $450? Awesome! Positive momentum and genuine reason to justify a purchase or recommend. \n\nInstead we got the “Biff is King” timeline, but without real hoverboards.",
      "If it’s true that the 7800 XT more or less matches the 6800 XT in performance, I genuinely wonder what AMD plans to do to fill the gap between that and the 7900 XT.

It's not \"the same\", it has similar performance but greater power efficiency and new feature sets.\n\nThis isn't really for people who bought the 6800xt to \"upgrade\", its for people buying a card today to get something better overall.\n\nIt's not a far out idea, its what most companies do and have always done.",

Priceless!\n\nIf anyone buys a card advertised as a 1440p capable in 2023, it either runs 2023 games @1440p or it's a lie and a fraud. A company's new graphics technology can't be a selling point and a pig to run at the same time, 5 years and 3 generations after its release!",

They have become the Apple fanbois and fangals of PC community claiming things that are false. Its a mute point to even argue with them at this point.\n\nAnd I see lots of builds in PCMR community that are just Intel CPU + 4060/4060ti and they claim that they got a bargain/good PC. Thats the level of tech knowledge they have. Either You praise their stupidity and help them feel good with their awesome choice or do not, cause they aint listening to reason or logic.\n\nRant over.

      "This example makes it clear that Nvidia profits from their status and raise the prices. Those two cards should be in a different price range based on their relative performance. Here in Canada, I guess the prices are not the same as in US, because the 4060Ti 16GB is priced the same as a 7700xt. I know it's similar in Europe and other places around the world so it explains a bit why even if this gen is technically great for AMD, they still loss market shares.\n\nI also can't help but notice how good DLSS is. At 3:04, and even later in other games, if you look closely at the edge of every thing it's so much smoother on the 4060Ti even though it's upscaled (not taking into account the tearing on the 7800xt side).",

They e been accumulating the chips for many months, not selling the cards yet to get rid of 6000 series stock, then they play this game to push out more 7800xt stick, then will drop the price of 7700xt in a month or two to sell those 15% yields. Assuming I understood the YouTubers correctly, who spread unverified rumors with nameless sources.",

      "Note the RT data is quite skewed towards Cyberpunk. They even included RT overdrive benchmarks for w/e reason which was never meant to run on Radeon lmao... even with Cyberpunk benchmarked **4 times** out of the 9 results, the RDNA3 GPUs are still holding up against their counterpart in RT. If you ignore Cyberpunk overdrive, 7700xt is 1.875% faster than 4060ti on average in RT (with Cyberpunk being benched 3 times). The 7800xt would be 4.375% slower than the 4070 in RT as well.\n\nThat brings me to conclude that the 7700xt is actually decent value vs 4060ti 16 GB on paper even if they are both \\~$450. With the 4060ti, you mainly gain DLSS 2 and 3, which isn't always present in all games (or you can pay for it lol ...), and 4GB more VRAM.

      "The main reason that happened was oversupply of last gen stock, so AMD fronted the generational value uplift via discounts, then slotted in these two more or less based on that.\n\nPersonally, even if it makes reviews boring, this strategy is **far** more customer friendly than the typical one. These GPU's are designed, and prototypes are made WAY ahead of time, so selling you reheated leftovers for full price one day and then immediately launching something that makes that price look silly is kind of entrapment...\n\nThey would have came out earlier, but people were incensed that last gen clearance pricing was better value than the 7600 (since last gen is more expensive to make for a given tier of performance so selling through it is top priority).\n\nSo since everyone told AMD that launching the 7600 when they did was an unwinnable situation, they held off releasing these two until last gen products were almost out of stock.",

    "selftext": "I am on this boat. But every week that goes by, I see myself close to jumping off from it.   \n\n\nI will give some thoughts and I would be happy to be proven wrong, and that the 7700/7800 are worth the wait, but I am finding it hard to justify. Here we go:  \n\n\n1. The upper tier of RX 6000 cards are being priced very aggressively as of lately. Namely the 6800XT and the 6950XT. Besides, we pretty much know that whatever price/performance ratio the 7700 and 7800 offer at launch, it is unlikely the beat the discounted 6000 cards. The 7600 vs 6600XT/6650XT was a good example of that.  \n\n2. Free Premium Starfield. That is a $100 game being offered with upper tier RX 6000 cards and we can't tell for sure whether it will be offered with the 7700/7800 cards. These cards are unlikely to be released before Starfield is (which is just 7 weeks away). Moreover, 2023 has been an incredible year for gaming - arguably the best year out of the last 5 years, if not longer. Some are suggesting it is the best year for gaming ever. That might be a stretch. Regardless, each month of this year that goes by without a GPU upgrade, well, it kinda sucks.  \n\n3. RDNA3 offers no significant technological improvement over RDNA2, other than a small performance/watt gain. FSR3 will work for both. Memory (a strong selling point for AMD) won't improve either: the 7800/XT will offer the same memory capacity as the 6800/XT.  \n\n4. AMD is not necessarily under pressure. Their stocks are doing pretty well - the only time in history they were higher was during the peak of the mining boom. Nowadays AI is where the money is. GPUs for gaming is not AMD's top priority, whether we like it or not.",
    "comments": [
      "Your point 4 is incorrect.\n\nThey are under pressure. IP that has been developed and productized needs to make a ROI.

The deals are too good right now.",
      "Is the cheapest, on sale RX 7900xtx still $900+?\n\nThen I have no trouble waiting.",
      "I was considering waiting, but looking their product stack and their pricing, there's literally nothing they could release that would be better then a 4070 for me.\n\nI would pretty much need to get a 7900xt performance wise, but using less power, for the price of a 4070, to want to give up the ray tracing performance, DLSS, cuda, reflex, and other nice Nvidia features. Those features really put in work and I'm tired of getting second class support all in the effort of raster performance. We're well past the point of raster being the only thing that matters, I'd happily give up 10-15% or more of my performance if it meant the card was better in all other aspects, and unfortunately that's the position I'm in with Nvidia and AMD.\n\nThis coming from someone currently on a 5700XT. When I bought that card over a 2070 super, ray tracing and DLSS were jokes. But if I could know how much better they were gonna get in the future I would have happily spent more on the 2070s.\n\nThat, and AMD's pricing here in Canada sucks right now anyways and I couldn't get a 6950XT for anywhere close to the price of a 4070 even if I did want that card, which I don't.",
      "What are you even talking about?\n\n> *nothing* is standard except the VRAM config\n\nThey are literally all the exact same card and will perform within 5% of each other, the only difference is the coolers and the warranty. \n\nPaying extra for better overbuilt coolers is stupid, you won’t get any better performance.",
      "I can understand someone not wanting the 6950xt due to the high power consumption, but the 6800xt is much more reasonable, and is appearing at or below $500 right now. Not much point in waiting. I got mine for $479 a couple months ago.",

I'm in a similar boat as OP's except I'm waiting on a bit of money to come in which I will use to make a purchase and I've been crossing my fingers for a 7700xt release. Really didn't want to buy 2+ year old hardware. Sigh",
      "> Really didn't want to buy 2+ year old hardware. Sigh\n\nTheres always pros and cons to buying brand new hardware. 7000 drivers were a mess at launch and it took months to fix them. Meanwhile, 6000 series drivers have been stable for well over a year. Another example, when I got my 5900x and x570 mobo in late 2020 (when 5000 series cpus launched), my ram wouldnt run at the frequency advertised (3600 mhz) without my system crashing like crazy. I had to run it at 3200 for over 6 months until there was a bios update that fixed it. So I ended up losing performance and paid for something I couldnt fully use for 6+ months. New tech is almost always overpriced at and around launch too.\n\nI get the allure of buying the brand new, shiny thing, but is it really that big of a deal to buy 2+ year old hardware? When you go car shopping, do you only look at the 2023 models and ignore everything 2021 and earlier? Even if you get most of the performance/features for a lot less money? What about TVs or monitors? The latest lg c3 is 25% more money than a c2 and has marginal performance increases at best. Most would say it's a waste of money to buy the c3 over the c2. \n\nI just think we need to change our mentality when it comes to these things. You shouldnt feel bad because youre buying something thats a couple years old. Especially when that thing thats a couple years old is priced well and is a big performance increase to whatever youre currently using.",

      "Surely the card to beat would be the slightly more expensive $600 4070super, no?\n\nThe [Techpowerup RT benchmarks](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/sapphire-radeon-rx-7900-gre-pulse/35.html) has the 4070super coming out significantly ahead at 1080p and 1440p RT. The 4k ones are close, but both cards are eating shit and dying at 4k RT (FPS in the 15-30 range), so not really relevant as no one would be running those settings.\n\nIt should also be noted that while the GRE is a faster card, it takes a bigger hit to FPS when using RT. This allows the slower 4070super to, generally, pull a pretty decent lead in RT.\n\nEither card would be a solid buy. It'd depend on the games you play, the settings you like, and how long you hold a card.",
      "It's crazy how people talk because in the latest generation while Nvidia definitely still maintains a lead it's not as big as it used to be.\n\nI find none of the games I play even use RT.",
      "Loved that he pulled up Ratchet and showed that despite having architectural advantages for RT, and hardware advantages for Frame Gen, they amount to nothing because NV shortchanged the framebuffer. \n\nIt's a 2023 game, at that. That should give anyone buying a 12GB NV card for RT and FG in year of our Lord 2024 some serious pause.",
      "Bu bu bu but AMD is 19 generations behind Nvidia in RT performance?",
      "Or even better, I was able to get a card like the 7800xt for around the same price as the 4060ti. It beats the hell out of it pretty much in everything. Even RT, or at least close\n\nSo what's the big deal? It evens out, and when you don't need RT, it has a massive gain\n\nNo DLSS? I don't even need to use upscaling because I was able to get more AMD card for the same price. \n\nAnd since I've moved to Linux it's a moot point anyway. Nvidia is garbage there (first hand experience)",
      "I don't really get this card. If you upsell to the 4070s for $50 more, you get better efficiency, a better feature set, the same raster performance and better rt performance. I can't really see a world where that's not a better deal.",
      "I don't know how anyone justifies buying this over a 4070S for $50 more tbh.",
      "Maybe I’m dumb, but wouldn’t buying either of these cards for RT purposes be a poor idea? It seems like you really need to jump up to the elite tier to get consistently decent FPS with higher resolutions while using RT.",
      "Man, people are just weird. \n\nWhen the rtx 30 series came out, people said finally RT is usable. Even at the 3060ti\n\nNow suddenly cards that destroy it, and ones 2-3 tiers above, are called too weak",
      "The 12 GB VRAM is the biggest problem with the 4070 and 4070S. I wouldnt buy either for this very reason.",
      "A cut down N31 barely beating a glorified midrange GPU while using 60% more power is not exactly something to be happy about.",
      "Yep for $50 extra you get significantly better efficiency, better raster performance in most titles, better RT all around, and DLSS. Probably a no brainer for most people.",
      "Yet there are so many ppl defending it.",
      "Spoilers: Title is editorialized version of a very editorial title. \n\nThis guy has no problems with comparing frame rates with unequal image quality. Why doesn't test the high settings with RT in Ratchet and Clank? Why doesn't he move down to balanced DLSS that still looks better than quality FSR? If he says that 76 fps is \"borderline\" playable with frame gen due to latency, how come he doesn't show the latency on the 7900GRE without Nvidia's Reflex technology. \n\nThe thing with this channel, and most techtubers, is that they tend to downplay Nvidia's advantages, and oversell AMD's. This is not surprising, they must present things as more of an equal footing for their audience. For narrative reasons, if there is an underdog, it must be plucky one.",
      "16 vs 12 GB of VRAM. That should make the AMD cards usable for one or two more years. 290/390/4x0/5x0 are still usable today if they are the 8GB variant. Those are up to a decade old now.",
      "Epic sent a love letter to AMD with SW Lumen. \n\nApparently it hammers compute, which is why AMD cards bench beyond their weight in games like Immortals of Aveum despite the entire game being designed around RT and not having any option to turn RT off.",
      "Impressive, very nice.\n\nNow let’s check the Productivity benchmarks:\n\nOh wait-",
      "> It's crazy how people talk because in the latest generation while Nvidia definitely still maintains a lead it's not as big as it used to be.\n\nThe advantage is still there just not as visible when you test it in \"we have RT at home\" games like F1, Far Cry or Spiderman. In Alan Wake 2 or cp77 rtx was 50% faster. Other than that, 7900 GRE have 33% more RT cores than 7800xt, the card which is a closer competitor in raster to 4070.",
      "Pretty much this.  They were definitely comparing the GRE to the wrong card.",
      "Part of it might be more people have shifted to 1440p 144hz+."

The front to back push-pull air configuration works best for air coolers, and maintains positive pressure.\n\nEdit: nvm about the negative pressure, didn’t realize it was the Lancool 216, but it would still be a good idea to drop at least two of those top fans, if not all three, going with an air cooler",

Straight horizontal push-pull setup, assuming you have a positive pressure system, means that most of the hot air will exit through the back of the case and not interfere with the CPU cooler.\n\nAnd on top of that, having a negative pressure case will lead to the issue of heat recycling, since the case will naturally suck in air through cracks and crevices, and some of that air will be freshly exhausted, heated air. You always want to make sure you have more intake than exhaust, but not too much more.",

If a 7800 is the same or slightly better than a 6800xt for $499, with some newer features and more efficiency, then that’s a pretty good offering, and a good improvement over previous gen price to performance.\n\nAt $549 it’s not BAD, it’s just not that exciting.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI was trying to optimize the efficiency of my AMD card and wondered why I can't set a lower power target than -10%. So I started benchmarking with different max clock speeds. I don't know if this is good in \"real life gaming\" performance, but I did it on the fly and just thought I could post it on reddit as well. (Spoiler: Yes, it's amazing!)\n\nKeep in mind that the specified clock rates are those that I have set in the software and that the real clock rates are somewhat higher. I also only ran the tests in a 3DMark test, as it is pleasantly short.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Model:** ASRock Radeon RX 7800 XT Steel Legend 16GB OC (90-GA4RZZ-00UANF)\n* **Driver:** 24.1.1\n* **Benchmark:** 3DMark - Solar Bay Custom 1440p, Fullscreen (no Async/Vsync)\n* **Tool:** AMD Adrenalin Software\n* **Default Card Settings:** Power Target: -10%; Voltage: 1.070V\n* **Watt:** average consumption in GPU-Z (by eye)\n* **ppw:** points per watt\n* **clock speed:** corresponds to what I have set in the program; real clock frequency was 100-120 MHz higher due to the lower GPU voltage.\n\n# Scores:\n\n**Stock:** 74 125 - 276W - 268,6 ppw\n\n**Default:** 77 211 - 250W - 308,8 ppw\n\n**1700 MHz\\*:** 44 898 - 130W - 345,4 ppw\n\n**1750 MHz:** 61 222 - 167W - 366,6 ppw\n\n**1800 MHz:** 62 337 - 170W - 366,7 ppw\n\n**1900 MHz:** 65 702 - 177W - **371,2 ppw**\n\n**2000 MHz:** 68 388 - 185W - 369,7 ppw\n\n**2100 MHz:** 70 397 - 195W - 361,0 ppw\n\n**2200 MHz:** 72 539 - 205W - 353,8 ppw\n\n**2300 MHz:** 74 704 - 220W - 339,6 ppw\n\n*\\*real clock was just 1275 MHz*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn its original state, the RX 7800 XT only achieves an efficiency of 268.6 points per watt. My best result at 1900 MHz is 371.2 points per watt (+38%). Comparing the relative power consumption with the stock settings, the card would consumes only 200W instead of 276W (stock score divided by best points per watt value).\n\nThe reduction of the relative power consumption to 72.5% is in my opinion extreme potential. The card is at least as good as Nvidia's RTX 40 cards whose power target would be set to \"70%\". In absolute numbers, this means: With 1900 MHz, 1.070v and \"-10%\" power target, the **FPS loss is 11.4%** while the **power consumption is only 64.1%.**\n\n# Screenshots from Starfield:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zmmh18byrufc1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4bb30ebaa7ab17d2ece426747f141facdf45cca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ku1w4abyrufc1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6599acf16b77213a0f85aaa021aec7d2d53541",

      "Lol, If I UnderVolt my 7900XT it does NOTHING for me if I don’t reduce my already EXTREMELY high Boost clocks from “stock” approx 2860 down to about 2700 or 2600 is then where I see a reduction in power with minimal fps loss maybe 2-4fps",
      "Thank you! But that's nothing special imho. From what I've heard, many people already undervolt their GPUs with lower power target, so oddly this doesn't really seem to be a thing. But I haven't really bothered with overclocking for 10 years because the benefits have always been quite small these days.\n\nMaybe I'm just oldschool and there aren't that many people who care about efficiency anymore. Don't get me wrong, I'm the typical OC guy from 2006-2012 when hardware in general had much worse efficiency. But nowadays all manufacturers overdo it and mid-range products already consume 200-300W. And entry-level models consume less, but in some cases there is no trace of efficiency anymore... Yes i look at you, RX 7600 XT with 190W!\n\nAMD may not have optimized the cards well, but I am very happy that RDNA3 itself is great.",
      "I was able to reduce my overall power consumption and increase my max core clocks on my 6800 XT by doing an undervolt. I don't think setting a power target would be nearly as good as a proper undervolt for AMD GPUs. Taking some voltage away allows the core to boost higher and use less power so a power limit shouldn't be necessary. I think I knocked off like 30-60w on my 6800 XT and got \\~10% more performance with the undervolt. I also went through this with my 4090. Yes, I know the architecture is different but I got the same results as my 6800 XT in terms of doing a proper undervolt rather than power limiting which knocked off about 50-100w depending on the situation and I gained \\~3% performance. Undervolting should always be better than power limiting from my experience and I have been overclocking GPUs since the 3DFX VooDoo 2. AMD in particular is really damn good with undervolting - both their GPUs and CPUs.",
      ">Everybody is going to hate this analogy, but AMD factory tunes their GPUs to be muscle cars, they don't have Tensor Cores or CUDA Cores or PhysX chips or what have you, so they make up for the difference with software optimizations and raw horsepower.\n\nWell I don't really think that's quite accurate, it's more like a base model or mid spec car vs fully loaded/top trim, you get the same on-road performance, without all of the bells and whistles and maybe flashy coat of paint that the  Nvidia cards come with.\n\nI also don't understand where this notion that AMD cards have more 'raw horsepower' comes from or what it's founded in. They're just more basic/less frills gaming focused cards, which if anything, simply have a larger fuel tank (more VRAM). I'll note you didn't say more, you just said raw horsepower, but I've seen that term used (often with the word more) since RDNA2.",
      "Same with my xtx at stock it tries to boost to 3gz and consumes an ungodly amount of power. I limit it to 2650 and see a reduction of about 50-70 w with no real loss in performance",
      "You can of course do both, underclock for efficiency or to increase/hold performance, but since the cards are so far from the sweet spot, it's more profitable for me to limit the performance.\n\n// Btw:  Lowering the voltage in AMD Adrenaline actually is like an offset and i guess it works as a percentage. In other words, lowering the voltage from 1.150v to 1.070v (93%) also reduces the voltage in games from e.g. 0.900v to 0.837v. That's why it's so rewarding to explore the sweet spot.\n\n// 1. feb 24 // It seems under a specific threshhold it is not like an offset. I testet it now with 1.000v and 1.070v. The real life voltage was in both settings 0,783v in FireStrike with 100% GPU Load. Imho the typical weird AMD OC/UV behavior, sadly it is kinda restricted. But the results are still very nice.",
      "Intel is on-par to cheaper than AMD now. (K vs. X parts, X3D parts are another price level above)\n\nGolden Cove/Raptor Cove cores (P cores) are, when properly tuned, better clock for clock and watt for watt than Zen4 - except for cases where AVX512 comes into play.\n\nHowever the E cores, despite being labelled 'efficient' are really only efficient on die area, they're far less power efficient than the P cores. \n\nZen3 was already more area efficient than Golden Cove, Zen4 just makes that worse for Intel - so to keep performance parity without making massive dies that cost too much to sell, they're pumping more E cores which hurt overall power efficiency.",
      "Yeah, RDNA3 sort of missed the mark on improving efficiency over RDNA2, even with the move to N5 (though chiplets aren't helping either). 1900-2000MHz is also where my 6950XT consumes less power, but still offers good performance. 2400-2600MHz is where it will eat power like crazy and use the entire +20% power budget even with undervolting.\n\nThere are cases, though, where the lower clocks may cause slight microstuttering (2160p) in RDNA2 (not sure if RDNA3 has this) that completely goes away once clocks are raised again. There may be architectural design reasons for that where timing targets (in clock cycles) were relaxed for certain pipelines or pipeline stages were added to improve high clock tolerance (common design decisions). Performance critical pipelines likely retain tight timing, short wire lengths, and no increase in pipeline stages to keep ALU throughputs and performance per watt competitive. However, architecture is always limited by the weakest link in the chain.\n\nEDIT: One interesting thing I've noticed in both AMD and Nvidia architectures is that large opaque textures/objects (like a body of water with high pixel coverage or a running river with moving translucent pixels) cause increased power consumption even if overall scene/geometry/object load hasn't increased. Alpha blending has been a power virus since the beginning of 3D acceleration and I wonder if anything can be done to fix that in future architectures. I mean, deferred rendering breaks this entirely, but I wonder if there's a way to make (forward rendered) alpha heavy pixels more efficient, maybe through hardware in an adjacent pixel interpolation pass? Basically trying to cut the amount of alpha blended pixels rendered through inferencing/interpolation.",
      "Yeah. These cards try to hit high boost clocks at all costs. Limiting how far they can clock pays dividends while only costing a couple of frames. I had my 7900 XT undervolted and limited to 2400MHz and those power savings were rather absurd in a lot of cases. I’d slash around 60-100 watts of power (and I’d get a much cooler running card) while still getting the performance I want.",
      ">Everybody is going to hate this analogy, but AMD factory tunes their GPUs to be muscle cars,\n\nApparently though, it's not OK when Intel does the same thing.",
      "Because on heavy tessellation workloads the 400 series ran circles around anything AMD offered back then and for the next gen too.\n\n\nAt the end of the day people only cares about performance and totally ignore efficiency, who could imagine that? *Looks out of the windows to thousands of cars with a single driver moving slowly than walking people*",

      "Yeah same here, however power is cheap where I live, so we send it. After that brutal cold snap last month with heater going, 2 gaming PCs, 2 tvs and electric stove my power bill was only 120 bucks.",
      ">I think that says something about AMD’s out of the box settings\n\nNot necessarily - it could also be saying that OP’s 7800XT has much better performance than the minimum bin AMD chose for that SKU. Without a large scale investigation, it’d be very difficult to figure out. In general I do think AMD cards are usually released with power levels that are too high, but 27% may not be what you’d typically gain.",

      "You will probably go WAY lower than 1900MHz@1.070V.\n\nMy 6800XT is on 2255MHz core clock at 1.007V or 2170MHz@0.963V stable. You will probably be fine at 0.9V or around that.\n\nRemember, what **really** saves energy is voltage, not frequency. P = U^2 / R, as per school physics program. It's a quadratic relation. So, by increasing voltage by 10%, you increase power consumption by 21%. By lowering it by 20%, you lower core power consumption by 36%.\n\nThus, you need to measure it in a different way. You lower BOTH frequency and voltage, define if it's stable, THEN you measure efficiency. This is really a correct way to conduct this  test.",
      "Unlike in this case, however, you usually have to be very clever.",
      "I see what you mean, I have issues with the analogy still but it makes more sense this way. \n\nFWIW I've found many Nvidia GPU's to be the same, stock tuning is right at the tip of performance using more power than it needs, seems like any contemporary GPU from either camp benefits from tuning, but perhaps AMD more so.",

I don't expect to have to upgrade my 6700xt for atleast another 5 years given how slow GPU hardware is improving.\n\nVRAM can be a reason to upgrade if certain games can't run or can only display a blurry mess which is the case with a number of new games on 8gb cards.",
      "If enough people are smart like the poster you replied to the prices will fall before that. I’ll also sit on my 3060TI for another few years if I can’t get a true midrange card again for less than €400.",
      "For real, price difference between 7700XT and 7800XT is already so low that it makes no sense to even consider 7700XT and just go for 7800XT. If they significantly drop the price on 7700XT then it would make sense but then the 7800 non XT would become pointless to consider.",
      "The 4070 Super will probably be more expensive than the 7900 XT.\n\nI don't know why people are in denial about Nvidia's pricing. \"Super\" is never a price cut or even price stabilisation; it's something like 8% more performance for 15% more money...",
      "1650, 1660, 2060 Super were more for more.\n\n2070, 2080 Super were more for the same.\n\nAlthough the 2080 Super was only like 5% more perf.",
      "7850XT would make more sense to compete with 4070 Super.",
      "....\"Rumors state a company that releases updated lineups is going to be creating an updated lineup.\"\n\nIs this really all they have to write about.",
      "It’s completed in the sense that they have released an SKU for each die. Doesn’t mean they won’t release a different variation for each die.",
      "They could always buy an used card for a more reasonable price a few years down the line if it comes to a point where the RX 5700 XT is too outdated.",
      "No, there's two possible reasons for the 7800.\n\n1. Vram prices crashed hard just before the launch of the 7700xt. You can get 8gb of gddr6 for $25 pretty much and this happened around June 2023. With the lead time to a product launch, the August release of the 7700xt was likely planned prior to these prices collapsing.\n\n2. Yields of the dies are good enough AMD wants to up the CUs. It could also be AMD found 60 CUs at lower clocks is perfectly stable, so there's no need to cut down to 54 when they could sell 60 just at a lower clock speed.\n\nSo, there are at least two reasons I see for this that make sense."

Now that is a noticeable difference. I wonder if they optimized drivers or why the GRE seems to be about 5% faster than last year in the HUB and computerbase reviews.",

If that's the case and there's no easy way to get around it even on custom AIB cards that's gonna limit it severely because of how overclocking works on RDNA 3.  \n\nIf not for bullshit artificial limits, these would probably be really good overclockers given the low stock clocks.  OC vs OC you'd probably be looking at more like a 15-20% performance advantage for the 7900 GRE vs the 7800 XT if you can OC the memory on the 7900 GRE a fair bit, and it would significantly close the gap to the stock 7900 XT which is what makes me think AMD will be assholes and artificially limit OC via firmware on these.\n\nFully expect that availability on these will be low as well, just as it was for the RX 6800.  The reason is that this is a die that's already been cut down to make the 7900 XT, in similar fashion to how Navi 21 was cut down to make the 6800 XT and even more cut down to make the RX 6800.",

      "MSRP + $100 incoming...",
      "Just please keep them as close to MSRP as possible. Especially the white because we all know there is usually a ridiculous added charge on white gpus",
      "Jake,\n\nA 850W PSU is recommended for the 7800XT...is that a mistake?\n\nWhen will the clock speeds be announced?\n\nThanks.",
      "1. The cards look great,  but tbh they need to stay as close to MSRP as possible,  or else they're DOA.   \n2. The white model looks the best in my opinion, but I don't like the yellowish logos.   \n3. A giveaway would be a good way to connect with consumers and give back to the community.  Just saying ;)",
      "Considering that the Suggested PSU for 7900 XT is 700W (750W in the ASUS PSU Table), that should be a huge overestimation.",
      "If they cost 10% more than MSRP then they're not worth it",
      "This, unfortunately. White is a real pain and challenge to get the color matching perfectly. Black blends better but white shows everything and even a slightly different hue can be apparent.",
      "That seems like an oversight to me OR that the article was written prior to actually receiving confirmed numbers, which is likely. I’ll pass this along. Like u/poppoo143 mentioned, the higher tier card already states a lower wattage psu.",
      "Personally I feel like the TUF Gaming line as a whole is missing on an opportunity to distance itself from \"gaming\" and be a sleeker more minimalist brand (as it is your cheaper option). I think at this point the whole \"gaming\" marketing in the computer component world is very oversaturated and as of today you could go as far as calling it \"gimicky.\" I'm a gamer, I don't need my components to say it on them. I'm aware I can game on my GPU and Mobo, that is what I bought it for after all. You already have the ROG brand, the TUF Gaming brand is starting to = cheaper asus brand, more than just gaming computer components which I think was the original intention when TUF Gaming launched.\n\nSimply put, if I were the VP of marketing I'd drop \"Gaming\" from \"TUF\" and try to capitalize on the anti-rgb movement and have it be a minimalist, sleek line and pivot from the \"cheap, downgraded ROG\" line that it has become synonymous with. Kind of like pro-art, but again not targeting any specific group. Let's be real, it's not like the consumer hardware itself would physically change if gaming was the focus or not. No board partner made \"mining\" focused hardware brands for example. Your Pro-art GPU dies aren't any different from your TUF or ROG brands.\n\nI would never buy Asus TUF Gaming branded products new unless they were steeply discounted, which is almost never the case, because I assume they're just intentionally built worse than they could be and usually they're not priced as such. And conversely I'd never buy your Strix brand new because I assume that the relative performance increase doesn't align with the price increase. Maybe what I'm asking for is to merge TUF and Pro-art into an economy brand, that is a general economy brand, priced at the bottom of the stack that doesn't feel \"gimicky and intentionally cheaper.\" Like a brand I'd buy for myself and not my 8 year old nephew because he can't have nice things yet. A big part of the problem is the Strix line is infamously overpriced at this point so it makes the TUF Gaming line seem way worse than it is.\n\nYour competitors do a much better job of differentiating and blending their brand tiers in my opinion. Take MSI for example, they have the ventus, Gaming trio & Suprim cards. When I think of the two Asus brands I think of intentionally worse thus overpriced gaming, and very overpriced, high quality gaming. MSI? Ventus is cheap and crappy, gaming trio is more expensive but performs to that bump while establishing a middle ground and then suprim is splurge. Not to say Strix doesn't compete with Suprim, but there's no middle ground for Asus and the juxtaposition between TUF and ROG is too big and obvious. MSI boards? I couldn't even tell you how that branding works, but all I know is they're not clearly pitted against each other as cheap vs overpriced. And Asus mobos still aren't out of the woods from voltage-gate from a public perception standpoint. ASRock? Same story as MSI, unique branding, no \"gaming\" overkill and sensible tiering.",
      "We should have pricing soon and I’ll update when we do. Part of why we’ve targeted the TUF series was to help keep prices a bit more reasonable compared to some other options.",
      "Recommended means nothing dude. I have a 850w psu for my 7900xtx. You're 750w psu is more than enough.",
      "It’s actually not ridiculous for white to be a more expensive color. It is harder to get good yields on white injection molded parts and painted parts. Which means either parts are rejected and then scrapped or reworked. In either case that leads to more money be necessary to make a unit. The auto industry does similar. The white colors tend to be an up charge color.",
      "Haha giveaways aren’t off the table though my personal preference is to first have some open and honest dialogue. Giveaways can muddy the waters on feedback and honest discussion.\n\nThanks for the feedback on the cards!",
      "I would like to know whether the coolers are repurposed nvidia ones or not. Some ASUS radeon cards have coolers designed for nvidia models, probably to save cost of development idk.",
      "Bro 3080 10GB is arguably the worst to get right now, the 7800xt will probably match its performance or slightly supersede with 6GB more vram for proper 2k or 4k textures in the near future. \n\nThese recommendations are really meant for typical buyers who usually have shitty Psu ... for example a noname 850w psu (such as that infamous series from Gigabyte) cannot match a solid 650w from FSP. Hence, they have to inflate these recommendation numbers in case some dumb ass uses these no name psus\n\nJust have a solid 650-700w and you should be fine with these mid range gpu",
      "Car paint =/= plastic parts for GPU.\n\nAlso white color isn't always the cheapest for cars, sometimes you need to pay extra for white.",
      "I like the rgb, it's not over the top. Looking at an 7800xt for a friend just waiting on availability and price in NZ, really happy with my tuf xtx",
      "I could probably find some info and other bits to sell you on a snazzy new gen card, BUT I think you’ve actually answered this yourself. The RX 6800 is cheaper and does the job you need, it sounds like? If so, that’s likely the best option for you. I’ll usually advocate a little bit for new versus used because of warranties, but when it comes to the generation and tier level, I’ll always suggest to choose what fits your needs and wants. \n\nIf you need to play X game at Y resolution, then base the purchase on that. \n\nIf you want a shiny new toy, then buy what you’ll have fun with within your budget. No need to justify your own expenses for fun.",
      "Your 750 should be perfectly fine I run a 7900 xt with a 750",
      "I liked the older TUF Sabertooth(X99/Z87/990FX etc.) aesthetic more than the more recent yellow TUF design. Seems like a massive downgrade.   \nROG/Strix lines seem super upcharged while being hit-or-miss quality wise."

    "selftext": "I'm seeing numerous posts on here saying that the 7700 XT is really just a 7700 or even a 7600 XT class card. Heck, even the 7600 is not spared although I think it performs fine as a 6600 successor. Are people just parroting what others online are saying?\n\nLet me break it down for you:\n\n* Architecture: They are both Nx2 classes (N32 vs N22)\n* Memory Capacity: Both 12GB\n* Memory Bus Width: 192 bit\n\nBut that's where the similarities end. It is much closer to a 6800 non-XT than it is to the 6700 XT\n\n||RX 7700 XT|RX 6700 XT|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Core Count|54 CU|40 CU|\n|Boost Clock Speed|2544 MHz|2424 MHz|\n|TDP|245W|230W|\n|MSRP|$449|$479|\n\nIMO, it a worthy successor to the 6700 XT and at a $30 discount, bringing much more features and significant performance uplift.\n\nIf anything that the 7700 XT should be guilty of is that it is priced too high or too close to the 7800 XT.\n\n**EDIT:** Again I want to clarify, not spotlighting the price (that is a separate debate), it's that people won't stop labeling it as a 7700/7600 XT. Even if they do label it as a 7700, people will complain the price is too high, but the performance would be greatly above its predecessor (6700).",
    "comments": [
      "Yeah it seems good but people are pissed it's priced so close to the 7800 XT. I think a $70-80 difference would set them apart better (either increasing one or decreasing the other).",
      "GN nailed it - at $50 gap it's not worthwhile, at $100 it's extremely compelling.",
      "You can't really compare release MSRPs because the 6700XT is now selling for $330.   \nPeople are disappointed that the 7700Xt is priced at $450 because the 7800XT is \\~20% better and 11% more expensive, essentially funneling everyone toward a higher price bracket.   \n\n\nThe 7700XT doesn't really fill a meaningful position in AMD's GPU lineup right now, at the $450 price point.",
      "Because if they released it at $400 they'd have the $330 6700xt and $350 3750xt collecting dust. Inevitably the 6000 GPUs will sell out and the 7700xt price will drop to $400 or less. Sucks but if they got stock to move they're going to price it around making it move. \n\nBasically where it sits now pushes people up to 7800XT or pushes them down to a 6750 or 6700. Once the bottom of this tier falls out (6000 series sold out and done), the price of the 7700Xt falls in response. Its pretty basic business and is done with almost every product you buy that has recurring releases.",
      "I live in Europe, and the price gap is actually roughly €100 here. The 7700 XT retails for around €520-550 and the 7800 XT is around €620-650, depending on XFX/Sapphire/Asus etc. (including all taxes and stuff).",
      "Yeah, people easily forgot what happened just a generation ago. if 7800XT is really priced that good then keep saying that 7700 should drop in price, can't the opposite also happen in which the 7800xt might actually increase in price? \n\ni am in a region where GPU prices tend to stick to what is release price and dont decrese BUT will actually increase in price if its always sold",
      "So AMD should just raise 7800xt prices! \n/s",
      ">Are people just parroting what others online are saying?\n\nthey're all saying the same thing because it's true, why would you buy the 7700 XT when you could get the bigger 7800 XT for just $80 more?\n\n$80 is a small gap for the current GPU economy today, and it's certainly better than the $170 difference between the 6700 XT vs 6800 XT.\n\nthe 7800 XT is not only faster, it also has 16GB of VRAM, quite a few RT cores and should only draw like 50-60watts more.\n\nthe 7700 XT is not a bad card, I've not seen anyone say that anywhere. it's position in the market is just weird.\nhere's hoping for a price cut for the 7700 XT.",
      "Then why would you ever buy a 7800xt or 7700xt when 6800xt is 500 brand new.",
      "Mindfactory sold many 7800 xt units for 559€, sadly other countries tend to get screwed with pricing.",
      "What a level-headed take",
      "If 7800xt rises more in price, then there is less actual incentive to chooce 7800xt over 4070 so i doubt it will go that way if amd is smart.",
      "It's even more pointless to compare it to heavily discounted 6800xt cards, that will disappear from the market in a few weeks. \nThe 7600 was compared to the 6700 10GB discounted to sub $300, which never had many cards on sale to begin with.",
      "So AMD should raise 6800xt prices too!!",
      "You can't really compare \"is now selling for\" prices either.\n\nA 6700 XT here (Philippines) is still $460. However, a 6750 XT is $440 - because the retailers got newer stock for it at a lower price. It used to be $540. It's also why a 6950 XT is cheaper than a 6800 XT.",
      "I'm so fuckin confused why every outlet insists on basing their review on MSRP and not *performance*. In 6 months none of their conclusions will make sense because the prices have shifted. \n\nI mean go watch everyone's reviews of 6700 XT or 6800 XT etc from last year. They all shit on it for being too expensive, and some even *re-reviewed* it after prices normalized. \n\nPeople use your recommendations well after launch. Like years later even. Including MSRP as a consideration is absolutely pointless beyond mentioning its current price. Because when you watch it a year later for a recommendation, suddenly the videos telling you to not buy a perfectly good card because they think it's not a good deal.",
      "Not everyone makes purchasing decisions from the mindset of \"what is the absolute maximum amount of money I can possibly spend?\"\n\nI could afford a 4090, but there's no chance Nvidia is getting $1,600 out of me. I could afford a 7950X3D, but it would be a waste. If the price:performance is close, yeah, I'll eat a bit of value for more performance (say, 30% more performance for 40% more money). However, with stuff like the 7700 XT and 7800 XT, it's easy to fit another $50 in the budget.\n\nHeck, there are times I'm debating between going all-out for a top-tier product to keep for a long time or getting something with much better value and upgrading more frequently.\n\nThat said, neither of these cards really does it for me. If the 7800 XT were $50 cheaper, I'd maybe get it. The 7700 XT needs to be more like $80-100 cheaper, IMO.

    "selftext": "Its been already asked since launch of 5060 ti but every case is a little different.\n\nI want (in fact I need to) change my GPU\n\nNow i have old excellent  GTX 1080TI. Its holding up fine but recent games seems to struggle to much.\n\nAnd i have kind fixed budget. And I need to buy something.\n\nBest i can afford is RTX 5060 TI 16GB  or RX 7800xt (previously i have considered Intel B580 so its already a huge price increase.) So RX 9070 or RTX 4070 or 5070 is not an option)\n\nIt has to be one of those two.\n\nIn theory 7800xt destroys 5060 TI. In every gameplay i saw like 10 to 30 fps more with RX 7800xt\n\nSo its seems that choice is simple. But, (there is always but) its not that simple.\n\nA small background.\n\nI play at 1080p 60hz LCD screen or 4K 60hz TV screen (only older games - 1080ti is too weak for 4K)\n\nI have rather weak CPU i7 11600H with DDR4 3200 memory.\n\nI would not change that in near future.\n\nAnd here comes upscaling and frame generation\n\nNvidia DLSS an FG is far more superior and common than FSR3.1.\n\nAnd i think for 4K gaming even RX 7800xt will struggle to to get 60FPS without upscaling.\n\nFor newer games (GTA 6 ???) even at 1080p i guess\n\nSo card with bad upscaling is not good choice for next few years....\n\nSo although im impressed with raw performance of RX 7800xt I still consider waiting for price of 5060 TI 16GB decrease, so it will be cheaper than RX 7800xt\n\nBut choice has to be made.\n\nWhich one would you buy?",

      "I own a 7700 XT and I never experienced that.",
      "I would personally buy the 5060 ti. The 7800 xt is stuck with FSR 3.1 (which is abysmal), is less efficient, and performs worse with RT on (unless it's a super light, and therefore pointless rt implementation). The 5060 ti should overclock quite easily to just about match a 4070 in raw performance (not that far off of the 7800xt).\n\nEdit: It may also be worth sticking with your 1080 ti for just a bit longer and saving enough to get a 9070, 9070 xt, or 5070 ti",
      "Tbh the 5060ti 16gb makes more sense to me, yes the 7800xt is a bit faster, but i think the current version of DLSS grants a bigger advantage. FSR 3 is pretty meh and falls really short compared to DLSS 4, only the 9000 series with FSR 4 comes close but obviously you'll be spending more for a 9070/xt.",
      "I just bought rtx 5060ti :) not the greatest model MSI ventus 2x oc plus but it will do the job.\nI found it at mrsp so it turned out to be 50$ cheeper than the cheapest Rx 7800 that I could find.\nI would get it on Wednesday. I will let you know how it works:)\nWas it good choice? Time will tell...",
      "I dont agree, dlss quality is like 30% performance increase, and basically all games where you will struggle with fps will have it.",
      "In truth, you’re asking if you should buy the midrange card (7800XT) or the budget option from the newest series (5060TI) which is purely up to you. Me though, I wouldn’t spend an equivalent amount on the budget option when you have a midrange card capable of some great raster performance available to you. Your cpu isn’t all that weak, and there’s nothing wrong with ddr4 memory, your cpu gets some pretty decent price to performance and in truth I don’t understand why you think you’ll need any kind of frame gen. If you want frames and raw performance, the 7800XT is your choice, if you *want* to use frame gen and have slightly less frames without using that feature then you should get the 5060TI. My choice would be the 7800XT though. I use it right now with a 9600x and I’m pushing the last of us part one with the settings cranked as high as they’ll go in 1080p well over 90-120 frames. Keep in mind ray tracing isn’t available in every game and that’s the reason (outside of greed) why nvidia costs so much.",
      "I DO have a7800xt and ive never seen anything that makes videos, even 4k video look any different than when i watch on another device",
      "It helps a lot and it's doing it with much better results than fsr3.1. if fsr 4 was available for rx 7800 than it will be much simpler choice. But we don't when  it will be (and if it will be because it's not clear)\nFor recent games it's seems like Rx will better choice, but for future releases? Not so sure",
      "As you can see it's hard choice :) \nAbout budget. It's not that I can't afford more expensive card. If I want to I can go and buy 5090 out of the shelf. It's that I think it's not worth it. I'm not heavy player. But I do like to play occasionally. To buy better card I will have to replace screen, cpu ,motherboard, memory and psu to make it sense. So it's pointless to buy better card ither than those two mentioned in my opinion.\nAbout DLLs and performance. My nephew has a rtx 4060 paired with Ryzen 5600.\nI was amazed what this setup can do with dlss on cyberpunk or last of us compared to what I was getting with my 1080ti\nThat the performance that I was looking for.\nAnd I almost bought 4060.\nBut then Intel b580 came out.\nI almost bought it :) . But It was little overpriced at the beginning. So I decided to wait. And then came Nvidia 50xx card release with 5060 announcement.\nI thought I will wait a little bit longer.\nAnd now when it's released I almost bought it :)\nBut I watched YouTube video with comparsion to rx 7800, where red team destroys green:)\nBut it was with very strong processor of course, without using DLLs or fsr , no RT.\nSo after all this digging in internet I still don't know ...

      "I have used both and really only started getting fed up with Nvidia with extreme prices and planned obsolescence because they use a smaller amount of memory. This is on purpose as its not a huge cost. So use what you want. Nobody will be able to afford upgrades soon. Get a card with the most ram.",
      "If you don't want to wait 7800xt.\nAt 4k FSR3.1 is not bad. Yes DLSS is more available but you can always optiscaler to try to inject FSR.\nNewer game that still lack any info can be as bad as optimized as it can be that 5060ti struggle alot even with DLSS and the excess performance of 7800XT might help especially in 4k.\nFor a rather old title, your best bet is using Lossless scaling in my opinion anyway.\nBut since AMD haven't yet release it's 9060xt, there is also option to wait for a bit to see how it's performance and hopefully at that point 5060ti/7800xt price also going down.\nSo more options as well.\n\nFor for now, my pick would be 7800xt.\nUnless you care about RT or efficiency (5060ti is a very efficient card) but probably wait is also a better choice.",
      "I have both. 5060ti in my main rig, and a 7800xt in our lounge gaming PC. I play at 1440p on the main PC, and the 7800xt at 4K in the lounge PC.\n\nThe 7800xt plays games like dragon age Veilguard and AC shadows at 60fps with some settings tweaks or frame gen. I generally steer clear of upscaling as I don’t like the artifacts it creates and FSR3 is pretty mid, however XeSS can be used by any card just like FSR3, and it looks a lot better imo especially at 4K.\n\nI think the 7800xt is a better option for 4K as it has more brute strength in terms of rasterisation. I’m happy with what I use it for. \n\nHowever, DLSS4 is very impressive, the best upscaling I’ve seen so far. It’s not perfect though, there are still artifacts etc, just a lot less than DLSS3. \n\nI personally use the 5060ti for high fps at 1440p, as it has more dials to turn as DLSS is more viable to use. I really don’t like upscaling in general, but especially at lower resolutions and DLSS is better at lower resolutions. I also chose it as it’s my main PC and it runs a fair bit more efficiently, and my main PC gets used a lot more than the lounge PC. The 5060ti sits at anywhere between 150-190w whereas the 7800xt is more like 190-250w.\n\nPersonally since you don’t utilise high fps in either situation, the 7800xt is a better option for you as it’s more capable at 4K. If DLSS or power efficiency is a major point of contention for you then maybe consider the 5060ti.",

      "You’re not missing anything",
      "Only thing this is good for is pushing the 7800xt price down to $450",
      "the argument is that by using the name “7900xtx” and creating a whole new segment (last gen topped out at 6900xt/6950xt not xtx) that it screwed up the whole alignment of the stack with respect to the actual performance of the products. The 7900XTX was not a 4090 competitor, they said that from day 1, so *creating a whole new segment on the top of the existing 6000 series for it* probably was not justified... and once you're committed to the XTX branding, it drags the whole rest of the line around, otherwise you get weird gaps.  \n\n7800xt for example barely outperforms 6800XT, and you can view that as a result of the top of the stack being too high and everything having to slide upward to fit. That 7800xt could have been called a 7700xt and then it’d have a sensible generational gain.\n\nOn the other hand I think this downplays the fact that AMD probably didn’t want to charge 7700xt prices for it at launch etc.  If it doesn’t use significantly less/cheaper silicon than the 6800xt, AMD can’t really reduce prices all that much. And remember they still knocked $150 off the original msrp of the 6800xt already… and 6800xt was not really inflated at all.  The 7800XT already launched at \"almost\" 6700XT pricing.  The naming isn't what matters, at the end of the day it's pricing that matters, and unless the lower names came with lower prices it wouldn't really change anything.\n\nPricing and naming has become this Rorschach blot though, everyone knows its “too high because of the pandemic/mining” but this allows people to impose whatever number *they think it should have been* and the reality is most SKUs aren’t gouged as much as people wanted them to be. 6700xt launched at $480 but probably never would have been less than $420 or $399 even without gouging… but people imagine that it would have launched at the current (clearance) pricing or something.  It would absolutely never have launched at $330 or $299.\n\nAnd I think that's the unacknowledged problem with this theory... if you call cutdown N31 as \"7800XT\" then you have that product segment going from $649 MSRP with 6800XT to $900 MSRP with 7800XT and that's bad optics for AMD too.  Even if you assume it launched at the \"real price\" of $749, that's still a $100 price increase over RDNA2.  7700XT (full-die N32) at $499 would have been a $20 increase over \"already gouged\" 6700XT pricing.  Etc. \n\nAMD is not immune to the price increases taking place either, they just went with \"shrinkflation\" (smaller generational performance increases) instead of outright price increases.  Basically instead of increasing prices they slid everything down a tier and then cut prices a bit so people would \"feel like\" prices went down after mining, despite a lot of that actually being the shrinkflation...",

Plus your average consumer is gonna look at the 8 GB VRAM of the \"7700 XT\" and compare to the 6700 XT and see the card as a downgrade.\n\nAnd even if you ignore all the above and just do the math, navi33 with 1/3 the CUs of a 7900 XTX is never gonna outperform the 6800 XT even if it throws power efficiency out the window",

If 7900xtx can beat 4080 in most cases then it's a fantastic card and as far as I am concerned 4080 is in a different price bracket.

They wouldn't be naming cards like this if it didn't work. I'm sure the vast majority of their customers don't know too much about card hierarchies. They just know that bigger numbers are better and Xs at the end are even more betterer.",
      "Also the outrage is really western centric. Previous generation AMD had massive discounts through the year over there. Meanwhile in the Philippines, 6800 XT is still $680 and 6700 XT is at $390. 4060 TI 16GB is at $550 now, so if 7800 XT releases at $550 here, that's massive value over previous generation.",
      "This whole naming problem just goes back to the XTX and XT. They tried to copy NVIDIA's homework, by copying the idea of naming a card higher than it should be and it's come back to bite them.\n\nIt should have been: \n\n* 7900 XT (instead of XTX)\n* 7800 XT (instead of 7900 XT)\n* 7800 (instead of 7800 XT)\n* 7700 XT (It can stay, it's probably the most appropriate name so far, but its overpriced. It needs to be $399 to be worthwhile.)\n* 7600 (another decent name, but it should've launched at $229 to save face on the reviews at launch, it sells for around that now anyway...)\n\nBecause they named the 7900 XTX and more importantly the 7900 XT what they did it's made the rest of their naming in the lineup pretty poor. They got greedy and decided to upcharge by naming the 7900 XT what they did to reap more profit, they get what they deserve really. A \"poor\" generational uplift in terms of performance when comparing the 7800 XT to the 6800 XT in reviews because of a dumb naming scheme.",
      "I believe the simple answer is that they actually wanted to get rid of the non xt versions. I really think the non xt's were a \"necessary\" evil during the GPU shortage simply because it allowed more product segmentation and allowed them to increase profits(6800's are just 6800xt's that were underperforming) so they didnt have to sell them as 6700xt's. \n\nNow we are over the shortage issues they want to get rid of non xt's for branding and simplifcation which i think is fine. The fact that the 7800xt looks \"bad\" compared to the 6800xt is just a reality and its a fair critisism but its a minor one as 6800xt was already a really good gpu at the price so a modernized version isnt bad per se, but from a consumer standpoint every GPU should have been a notch, in nvidia's case sometimes 2 notches, below what they actually are. Its just a reality of current gen GPU's. In the end price to performance is king and 7800xt is a good GPU.",
      "To be fair too, they still sell a lot from first day sales numbers from multiple outlets. Having the 6800 XT at great value doesn't make the 7800 XT a bad card at all. Especially since some countries never dropped the price of 6800 XT (still $680+ in the Philippines). The 4060 TI 16GB is at $550 now, so the 7800 XT releasing at same price is MASSIVE value over the 6800 XT.",
      "You don't get the point, the name doesn't change the performance of the card but it is used for deceptive marketing and as excuse to inflate prices.",

No one was really complaining then for some weird reason, people just read the specs and checked prices instead of expecting that number 6 or number 9 provides whatever they want.",

By the time FSR 3 comes out DLSS 3.0 will have matured and have made its way into games, basically meaning FSR 3.0 is probably going to have the same issue as previous iterations—adoption rate. Next problem will be RT performance, power consumption, content creation, and probably pricing to compete. \n\nAs seen with the comparison between the 4070Ti and 7900XT, rasterization performance alone isn’t going to sell a lot of cards, feature sets are going to dictate what card has better value. \n\nI had high hopes for AMD with the 7xxx series, but when I see basically normal generational steps up with their lineup while not pushing the envelop and charging high prices, it really disheartened me. \n\nNvidia, while still expensive, saw some nice gains, especially in the 4070Ti, while also bringing out a much more robust feature set at launch, and nailing the power consumption, unlike AMD that just keeps promising, is why I chose Nvidia this time around. \n\nC’mon AMD, innovate!

The current prices are insane, and the lowest RDNA 2 discounted cards are the only ones that remotely approach what i consider a fair pricing. \n\nSeriously, it wasn't long ago when the top end GPU was like $500. Then suddenly it was $700. And then it was $1000. And then $1200. And then $1600. \n\nIt's insane. \n\nHeck, I remember in the late 2000s you could get like a 9800 GTX for like $250 or something. \n\nI remember my first GPU being a $80 3650 and my first \"REAL\" GPU being a 5850 for like $300 or something.\n\nAnd that was like the fourth strongest single card on the market at the time, only below the 5870, 470, and 480. \n\nI mean I remember when the market had like several tiers of products in the $100-200 price range alone.

Current amd gpu gen is looking so pointless, at these prices, unless you are going for a 7900xt or 7900xtx.

AMD no longer has a **90 competitor, yet they've reintroduced the XTX SKU for some reason. RX 7000 GPUs have all the downsides of being MCM products with none of the benefits.

Every GPU launched in between is just a stepping stone.",
      "As usual it depends on the specific game but overall the 7900xt is much faster. 27% in God of War, 40% in Cyberpunk, 30% in AC Valhalla, 35% in RDR2. Also 26% higher in Port Royale and 28% higher in Speedway.",

Seems like the larger lower level caches help alleviate the need for more Infinity Cache. 128MB Infinity Cache on the RX 6800 is overkill as you'll never clock high enough (2.6 Ghz max) to introduce notable bandwidth bottlenecks in most titles.",

But you just *know* AMD are going to try for 600-650",

I just want comptetition again but if you think AMDs sells just as many GPUs as Nvidia - or even outsells them - you need to wake up from that dream.\n\nI think many AMD users just buys from Mindfactory. They are very AMD and always released their CPU/GPU sales with the public. If you look at [Caseking.de](https://Caseking.de), one of the biggest German retailers, and check their GPU popularity (most sold) it does not reflect Mindfactory at all either.",
      "This isn’t indicative of the rest of the world. Germany has more of a Radeon culture than the rest of the world because ATI/AMD have/had a bunch of major offices there iirc.\n\nI do find it interesting they’re still going for Radeon after the major increase in energy prices though. I’d have thought they’d go for either a 4060ti or a 4070 because of how much more energy efficient they are. The 4060ti in particular just sips power, I wish an AIB would come out with a half height or single slot version already."

      "I don't think they were complaining. \n\nIt's well known in the industry that Nvidia withholds details about their power limits from manufacturers until the last minute, and in the meantime the AIB's are stuck designing coolers for the absolute maximum TDP they think a generation can ever reasonably expect to hit. That's why the 4080s and 4090s were pretty much universally overbuilt, everyone built them to be able to reasonably dissipate the heat from a 600w load. \n\nRealistically, the 30-series coolers would have been adequate for the 40 series. \n\nThe size bloat is Nvidia's fault. They determined power limits too late in the development cycle, even their own FE cooler is overkill for what these GPUs can be expected to do.\n\nNone of this is a slam on any of the AIB's or even Nvidia, it's just the way it is, and it bloated both size and production costs. We would hope that Nvidia would learn from this and finalize their engineering earlier in the development but the 4090 was an unprecedented success and all their efforts are going into AI now so we consumers will just get what we get going forward.",

      "I fear people will OC their card to be unstable then continue to blame bad drivers when infact it's user error flamed by inflated expectations.",

Memory overclocking is much trickier to get right and the chips on the card are rated for 18gbps, not 20 like with the other 7900 cards. the fact that they managed to get it to around 20gbps should not be taken for granted.\n\n\n\nI feel like a good amount of people are going to try and replicate other people's results and when those fail at some point, blame the card or the drivers. \n\n\nWe probably see that happening already with so many recommending undervolting the cards expecting to replicate others' results without first realizing that just because the value sets and it doesn't crash immediately, you won't get some sort of issue later on. \n\n\nRunning a card out of spec can have many different ways to fail, you could see more issues with frame pacing, you could see driver resets, you could see texture or polygon flicker, you could see artifacts, sudden crashes to the desktop without an error message and all of them could be random at a random time. It doesn't even need to be at load to manifest itself. \n\n\nPeople used to be way more aware of the consequences of overclocking and undervolting. I don't know if it's just me getting older and crankier or if it is actually an issue.",

Now.. if you are able to overclock it and get let's say 15% not 10%, it's even better value, let alone 20%. IDK how to translate +10 fps into % performance, but i guess it's somewhere between 0% and 10%? Anyway, if it's true, this is a good value gpu right now.",

That's around the price of a 6800, but with less VRAM. Plus you can find 6800s for $430, which is the maximum this card should have been. AMD probably saw how bad the 4060s were and got a little too confident.",
      "On AMD's own slides the 7800XT is 20% faster than a 7700XT for 11% more. There is definitely something weird going on like yields are really good, so they are making many more 7800XT and don't really want to sell 7700XT???",
      "Its probably both cards cost a similar amt to make, like the 7900xt/xtx, and they want to push folks into the more expensive SKU. In a few months, the 7700xt will be down to 399.",

      "People have been brainwashed to consider mediocre products good after travesties such as 7900 XT or even worse, the absolute potato 4060 Ti.\n\nIf 4070 was a 4060 Ti sold at 499$ - which it should have been - anything more than 449$ would have been outrageous for this 7800 XT which should have been 7700 XT or at most 7800 to begin with.\n\nBut with Ada being mildly (4070) to very underwhelming (4060 Ti), 6800 XT performance for 499$ and newer tech sounds very compelling out of nothing - **because in the current market, it is.**\n\nBesides, AMD has a (recent) history of not actually competing with nVIDIA at launch in terms of MSRP, so the fact that they have at least read the room this time makes this launch better than it actually is.",
      ">$450 for the 7700 XT is bad.\n\n7700xt is clearly there to upsell 7800xt and would likely be disounted later like 7900xt was.\n\nHonestly 7800xt seems like an amazing 1440p card  after their FSR3 presentation that will last years. Both need independant testing though.",
      "The whole point is to upsell 7800xt, yes, to be discounted later. Atleast 7800xt looks amazing unlike 7900xtx for its price as long as FSR3 lives up to DF expectations.",
      "I don't think it's \"falling for\" anything as much as it is making the best out of a shit sandwich.",

      "Because 7000 series supports Anti-lag+ and driver-level Frame Generation. It has AI cores that would be needed for future iterations of FSR and therefore those cards would last longer than 6000 series despite their similar raster performance right now.\n\nThat's objective. 'Upscaling looks horrible' and 'Fake Frames are not real frames' are subjective.",

(1080p) CAM software doesn’t show GPU stats anymore but with the dual bios that’s not necessary anyway. Stress tests all maxed out at 65 degrees on silent bios. Noise was fairly loud on the performance bios preset and adrenalin fan tuning doesn’t seem to make a difference so I went with the silent bios preset, haven’t had any issues so far. Exactly what I was looking for and I only imagine performance improves from here with FSR 3 and the advance of RDNA 3 drivers. Have high hopes for this card!!

What I did was do the auto overclock and I comes up with a mhz it will overclock to. Mine came up at 3105mhz so I set my max to 3100mhz and min 2200mhz.

On value, AMD loses at every tier. In value, RX 7000 loses to RX 6000 at every tier, since 7000 uses the price and name of a higher tier than it should.",

Instead, it's a similar-powered card for less money.\n\nEven then, it's generous to consider. It's around the same price the 6800 XT is selling for now. Where we'd expect a new GPU roughly a year after launch, the 7800 XT is launching almost 3 years after the 6800 XT. So, it's on-par with a 3-year-old card that's been on sale for about the same price as the 7800 XT.",

      "What makes it matter is a lot of consumers just don't know enough. They check in every 3-5 years, look at the numbers on the box, then make a choice.\n\nThis lets AMD slide their cards' branding up a tier. People will see \"$1,000 7900 XTX vs. $1,600 4090\" and not realize they're buying a 4080 competitor. They'll see a 7800 XT and not realize it's a 4070 competitor that's not much better than the 6800 XT. They won't realize they're buying a 7700 XT with a different name.",
      "**They don't!** And for the most part, AMD have had naming conventions that were wildly different from Nvidia's. There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut AMD ***chose*** to align their product numbers, pricing, and performance (for the most part) to Nvidia's for both the RX 5000 and 6000 series. The problem is that AMD *mostly* did the same for the RX 7000 series, but completely threw it in the bin at the high end. It's a way for AMD to pull the wool over anyone who doesn't pay enough attention. Why else would AMD announce a SKU above the 7900 XT in a generation where they don't hold the lead?\n\nIt's just a matter of setting a precedent then going against it arbitrarily.

      "It's the best selling gaming SKU because it's one of the cheapest 7900XTXs and the RTX 5080 is both unobtainium and the best advertising for the 7900XTX since it launched.\n\nPeople holding off on an upgrade who waited for the 5080 are sorely disappointed so probably buying the 7900XTX because they can't get 4080s.",
      "There was also people looking to upgrade to latest highest performance AMD GPU. e.g. me\n\nGiven the 9070 won't outperform the XTX, you may as well buy the XTX instead of waiting how long for them to release a 9080/9090",

      "I don't think there's a meaningful argument to make about this right now. Much of the RTX 4000 lineup has gone out of production to make the RTX 5000 stuff, which is on the same node. Between that, allocation of silicon to datacenter cards, and the general lack of availability of RTX 5000 right now, there's not a lot of stuff to sell. Even the 7900 XTX can be hard to find.\n\nWe don't even know what it would take for AMD to make a higher-tier card this generation. Would it take 3 times the silicon (like with the 5090 vs. 5080)? Could it match a 5080? 4090? 5090?\n\nMuch of RDNA 3 was, in my opinion, a mediocre bunch of products. Pricing and time to market was a bug part of why. The XTX is selling now because Nvidia has nothing you can buy and it's come down 15% or more from its launch price. It's not like the XTX has been a sales monster for the past 2+ years.",

      "From what little I have heard of RDNA4, it is going to look very alien compared to even RDNA3.\n\nCUs appear to be larger individually based on die size leaks. N48 is \\~30% larger than the N31 GCD for 67% the CUs, and while yeah, GDDR6X PHYs are large, they aren't that big.\n\nComparing to N32, which has the same bus size and only 4 fewer CUs, its GCD is about half the size rumored of N48. N48 is similar in size to GB203, likely a touch larger, so 5080-like silicon costs given both are 4nm.\n\nRDNA2 to RDNA3 by comparison isn't a large jump in the actual CU design from what I can tell after probing around on my 7900XTX and 6700 10GB cards, or my 780M and 680M machines. Most of the changes appear to be in dual-issue support, WMMA support, and some little RT tweaks. Caches also look like they got some changes to handle the extra interconnect delays maybe. RDNA3 looks like RDNA2 on steroids from my perspective, while RDNA4 looks like it may be more like a RDNA1-2 style shift.\n\nIIRC FSR4 relies on FP8, which RDNA3 does not natively do, or at least does not do well. If RDNA4 has dedicated high-throughput low-precision hardware, such as a big block of FP8 hardware in each CU or WGP, then that gets you both die size increases and functionally exclusive FSR4 functionality. Of course brute-force compute is also an option. Maybe there is some threshold amount of BF16 grunt that RDNA3 can put up for at least the halo cards to be technically compatible, (7900 family being a nice cutoff) but maybe not.",

At that price range if you're just playing games, you're arguably wasting money on a card like the 4090 because it exists to do more than game.\n\n^(EDIT: Although for 4K enthusiast, it is a compelling offer, but the price coupled with Display Port 1.4 support does hurt new 2023 4K monitor support..

Sure the 4090 is an absolute behemoth of a card but it's just too frigging massive and power hungry. The pricing is exploitative at best and the 4080 12gb was an absolute farce.\n\nThe plan right now is, wait for the zen 4 3d cache cpus in apr/may 23, pull the trigger on a full amd rig and give the middle finger to nvidia.

If you compare 7800XT with 7900XTX thats 60% more CU but results only in 44% higher performance. 7900XT has 40% more CU and 28% more performance. The sweetspot always seems to be around 64 CU (Scaling from 7700XT to 7800XT is way more linear).\n\nAlso RDNA3 used Chiplets while RDNA4 is monolithic. Performance might be 5-10% shy of an XTX. It comes down to architectural changes and if the chip is not memory starved.",
      "I'm also waiting to decide between these two cards, my focus is raster performance in 1440p gaming.",
      "I bet AMD did something to make these additional ALUs more useful. Something like adding more register space and extending the types of instructions the second set can perform to allow for single-cycle Wave64 execution more often.\n\nHaving less CUs also means having less scheduling overhead btw. I believe one of the reasons the command processor in flagship RDNA3 clocked higher than the shaders was because of such overhead.\n\nAnyways, the rumored 390mm² seem considerably large for a die with just 64CUs and a 256bit memory interface. Something in that chip is needing tons of space and I don't think it's the fixed-function units or shaders (although the latter are probably less dense than usual to allow for higher clock speeds).\n\nI can't wait to see the architecture reveal and test results from reviewers - I love seeing how these technical aspects affect performance.",

      "Clocks can't solely compensate for missing SM/SP. I'm hoping the node change/monolithic design adds something. The performance is definitely going to be between the 7900GRE & 7900xt. Hoping it's closer to the 7900xt.",

      "Not cheap anymore after 20 Jan.",
      "It's because if someone is paying $1000 or more for a gpu they'll just go Nvidia.  People on the mid and low end are more willing to go with amd because of the price to performance.",

      "2-7% faster depending on the outlet/games used.",
      "First of all isn't it basically what I said? The difference increases as the resolution does. 1080p Numbers for 4080s and XTX are the least useful numbers you could find.",
      "With you there, though never even considered 5070. I sold my XTX as I felt ML upscaling has become a requirement for high end gaming. \n\nI'm leaning towards 5070ti simply because I don't want to be left out of the show, again. But the 9070xt might just be such a good deal in comparison while still having good RT and upscaling that I'm still undecided. \n\nI'm at uw1440p so I'd assume if the leaks/rumors are just sorta right the 9070xt is gonna be a fantastic option. But id assume for very good RT performance the 5070ti is likely necessary, especially at my resolution."

    "comments": [
      "No. This is right. This is what AMD claimed.\n\nWe can't tell how true the numbers are until we get to benchmark it ourselves, though. But it looks great.",
      "Use the Techspot / Hub chart instead. TPU tested with a 5800X which did cause some slight CPU bottlenecking at 4K with the 4090.\n\nTechspot had the 4090 scoring 144fps in the 4k 13 game average and the 6900XT scoring 77 fps. The 54% perf/watt claim was for a 7900XTX at 300W (sneaky bastards) so that gets us to 119fps @ 300W. The extra bit of wattage will allow higher clocks but I expect that causes the perf/watt to drop off (otherwise AMD would have just compared stock vs stock like in prior launches) so lets say that extra 18% power only increases performance by 10% (might be generous but I don't know). That gets us to 130 fps in Techspot charts. Their 6950XT scored 85 fps in those charts and 1.54x that is 131fps so it is close IMO.\n\nGiven that that would make the 4090 about 10% faster than the 7900XTX in raster.\n\nThe 4080 16GB in the NV slides was about 20% ahead (using fantastic eyeball maths!) of the 3090Ti. That card scored 91fps in the techspot chart so that puts the 4080 16GB at around 110 fps.\n\nSo stack will probably look as follows for raster\n\n* 4090        144 fps ($1,600)\n* 7900XTX  131 fps ($999)\n* 7900XT    115 fps ($899)\n* 4080 16   110 fps ($1,200)\n* 4080 12   90 fps ($900) - or whatever it renamed to\n\nFor RT it might be more like (I did raster * 0.65 for NV and raster * 0.5 for AMD here)\n\n* 4090       94 fps ($1,600) 66 fps with new scaling\n* 4080 16   72 fps ($1,200) 51 fps with new scaling\n* 7900XTX  65 fps ($999) 41 fps with new scaling\n* 4080 12   59 fps ($899) 41 fps with new scaling\n* 7900XT    55 fps ($899) 37 fps with new scaling\n\nSo if you want RT performance then 4080 16 is not terrible, about 10% or so more performance for 20% more money. If you want raster then 7900XTX or XT are both good. If you want both you spend the $$ and go for a 4090.\n\nEDIT. I went through and checked the RT scaling at 4K in the games techspot tested. 4090 came out at 0.46x and 6950XT came out at 0.31x. Assuming the 4080 and 7900XTX are similar to those numbers I have updated the numbers to reflect that. It pans out that perf/$ is looking to be about the same for RT performance between NV and AMD but AMD will hold the advantage in raster which might offset the features NV have for some people, time will tell.",

      "I think the biggest issue is that the prices have just been unrealistic for months. Like before the price cuts the 7900 xt sat at 680 and the 7900 xtx was 880 dollars. Who wants these cards at these prices? Amd needs to be realistic. No one wants end of life generation products for a premium. There's a reason why these just sit on the shelves and no ones buying them. As a result, you need to make them more appealing by price dropping them significantly or otherwise nobody will buy them.",
      "AMD completely screwed the pooch with pricing this generation, despite Nvidia giving them every opportunity to yank away market share with a superior value proposition.\n\nIf the XTX had launched at $750-$800, the value proposition versus the 4080 would have been absolutely undeniable.  But instead they launched at $1,000, and at that point, people either spent a little more for the 4080, or a little less for a 7900XT/4070ti.",

But I concur, I've been around since Poor Volta and Raja. AMD's marketing seems to be the only part of the company that's made zero attempt to improve at all. At least the GPU division *tried* with RDNA to some degree. \n  \nEdit: It appears I've angered those that love Nvidia. You all may not agree with how I view things because, while I realize a publicly traded company solely exists to make money, my worldview comes first. And in that, ethics is important and no entity is spared. If you want me to concede that jumping on an opportunity for monopolization and price gouging isn't consumer-hostile, I don't know what to tell you.",

If you want strongest there is - you go for 4090 without choice.  \nSecond: 4090 actually provides noticeably better performance AND noticeably better featureset for higher price. For some this is enough to pay the premium.  \nThird: quite a few people bought 4090 not for, or not only for, gaming - it is the best GPU for many working tasks there is today, including modelling, AI ect.",

It can be on comparably usable levels IN BEST CASE SCENARIOS (Quality preset on 4K output), but the moment situation gets harsher: either need for lower preset or lower than 4K resolution: FSR becomes very obviously worse FAST. As for \"given it's open source it's likely to surpass DLSS at some point\" - not happening. No bias or anything - just absolutely technically impossible for it to even match DLSS, let alone surpass it.

The reason they might not compete in this area in the consumer discrete gpu market has less to do with capability and more to do with how much they care to prioritize the market segment in general.

They are competing with Nvidia who is significantly larger than it and only does GPUs whereas AMD is competing on both CPU and GPU side on a shoestring budget compared to both main competitors.\n\nIt's a shame really but if AMD could invest more money into the driver team (not that they don't work, just need more help) it would pay dividends as they do improve a lot after launch, because their launch state was just bad.",
      "It's a known issue in the driver\n\n> Some virtual reality games or apps may experience lower than expected performance.",
      "You know with big companies it is often not the teams but management fucking up. I am confident they knew about problems, reported and worked on them but management thought pre christmas release without good vr support is better than other options."

    "selftext": "- compilation of 14 launch reviews with ~8490 gaming benchmarks at 1080p, 1440p, 2160p\n- only benchmarks at real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks\n- geometric mean in all cases\n- standard raster performance without ray-tracing and/or DLSS/FSR/XeSS\n- extra ray-tracing benchmarks (mostly without upscaler) after the standard raster benchmarks\n- stock performance on (usually) reference/FE boards, no overclocking\n- factory overclocked cards were normalized to reference clocks/performance, but just for the overall performance average (so the listings show the original performance result, just the performance index has been normalized)\n- missing results were interpolated (for a more accurate average) based on the available & former results\n- performance average is (some) weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks\n- all reviews should have used newer drivers for _all_ cards\n- power draw numbers based on a couple of reviews, always for the graphics card only\n- performance/price ratio (higher is better) for 1440p raster performance and 1440p ray-tracing performance\n- for the full results and some more explanations check [3DCenter's launch analysis](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-geforce-rtx-5070-vs-radeon-rx-9070-xt)\n\nNote: Many testers have used heavily factory overclocked models for the 9070 (XT). This effect was of course deducted from the average performance values. For this reason, the average for 9070 & 9070XT is (some) lower than most of the individual values.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRaster

      "Worth mentioning, that ray tracing includes black myth wukong, which is completely broken on AMD and is basically bruteforced, so it Heavily bricks the results for ray tracing on AMD cards. It's ~5-6% better average if you exclude it (since it's a huge outlier)",
      "This. Removing the statistical anomaly or highlighting it would be helpful for a more accurate understanding.",
      "I was planning to buy an RTX 5070 but everyone on the internet told me to wait for RX 9000.\n\nI bought a Gigabyte Gaming OC RX 9070 XT for 85 USD more than the cheapest RTX 5070 in my country🙂\n\nThank you people. My RX 9070 XT demolishes the RTX 5070 where it matters. I believe the 5070 only beats it in path tracing and Black Myth Wukong.\n\nEdit : For those wondering here was my options in my terrible country (expensive GPUs, low wages, 3rd world)\n\nRTX 5070 : 85 USD cheaper than the RX 9070 XT\n\nRTX 5070ti : 195 USD more expensive than 9070 XT\n\nI'm very happy with my choice.",
      "Perhaps watch the DF video on Avatar?  It's one of the best implementations of GI and other RT features (bar the path tracing titles).\n\nIt runs well on AMD not because its RT is bad but probably because it favours AMD in raster and so when Heavy RT settings are used AMD GPU's have a bit more cushion for extra performance drop.",
      "Cant buy either for sane price in Europe",
      "Worth mentioning that Black myth wukong uses a specific Nvidia fork of unreal engine. Not a conspiracy to assume that Nvidia cards have primary focus on that engine.",
      "He's talking about Black Myth Wukong results being an outlier due to raytracing in that game being broken for AMD. Not the existence of raytracing games being an outlier.",
      "TLDR, just look at the average row for each set. It's normalized to a 5070, so if the average line for a card is 110%, that means it's 10% faster than a 5070.",
      "Test was done at very high RT. The usual usage of it, not PT level. For BMW and Alan wake it's PT, actually, that is why it is borked. In Alan wake both vendors die anyway, so having 20 fps on AMD or 25 on 5070 - who cares. Cyberpunk RT works great on both cards and that's what will be in future games.\n\nBMW on the other hand, is completely broken on AMD. Like, it's a sabotage at this point.",
      "No, but the RX 9070 XT beats the rtx 5070 (12GB) even in Ray Tracing😂 Its path tracing where it falls flat on its face, but that's a super duper tiny Sacrifice I am willing to make. \n\nThe RX 9070 XT beats the RTX 5070 in Cyberpunk at 1440p Ray Tracing Ultra preset and basically anything that isn't path tracing I believe (besides Black Myth RT)\n\nI got significantly faster raster  , a little bit faster RT and 16GB VRAM for only 85 USD more. The RTX 5070ti (16GB)  is almost 200 USD more expensive than the RX 9070 XT I bought\n\nI love this card. I just finished undervolting the card. I am getting 230w avg power usage and -3.5% perf decrease",
      "This is many number, and I many stupid…\n\nIs there a TLDR?",
      "Games that rely on RT only like Indiana Jones and Metro Exodus work well on AMD cards so IDK what that guy is talking about. Wukong just runs badly on AMD.",
      "No, the game specifically is an outlier. Cyberpunk with path tracing on all other AMD cards before this performed similarly with the 7900xtx falling behind even the 3060 Ti, but performance is much better with the 9070 and 9070XT. The 9070 XT performs on par with a 4070 in path tracing in Cyberpunk now and heavy RT results across the board are miles better than last generation... But Wukong still performs like shit.\n\n5070 is 15-20% faster in Cyberpunk PT and 73% faster in Black Myth Wukong for some reason.",
      "Same situation in Australia. These companies only care about the American market.",
      "nice",
      "It's a huge outlier and statistics doesn't work that way.\n\n\nIf you keep the broken crap - the difference is 20%. If you ignore that one single crap - it's 10% or so. And that might be a very important thing for buying decision.\n\n\nSo yes, it is important to mention the outlier, so people can see that a make their decision correctly. Because in other RT games AMD is very competitive, like in cyberpunk or avatar or star wars.",
      "BM:W catching strays for no reason.",
      "Also don't forget access to FSR4 when choosing between 9000 and 7000 cards. It's apparently a night and day difference",
      "GNexus review kept BM:W out of the main averaging and still reported the NVIDIA as better in RT. But said 9070 XT was a good buy for MSRP.",
      "how do you come to that conclusion? the 9070 is faster, the 9070xt is faster than the 4070 super.\n\nIts faster than the super and the same price (or 9070 is less).\n\nVery bad TLDR"

I can't believe people were saying 90-95% of the 4090 at a much lower price before,\n\nAMDS marketing was definitely misleading now looking at the average uplift and the conclusion. people were expecting 50-70 percent more performance than the 6950XT but AMD lied out their ass.\n\nwith the average performance jump being 35% with many games below even that. They've definitely pumped their numbers before with every single GPU launch press but this is by far the worst one yet. it led to people having way too high expectations for this GPU, I guessed the average would be below 50% because of the small amount of games tested and cherry-picking and lack of 4090 comparisons but dang\n\n&#x200B;\n\none last edit: this also shows that time spy extreme is really accurate at predicting performance. that leak showed the 4080 and 7900xtx dead locked which is exactly what happens in real world games",

Always loved AMD and despise Nvidia but that’s the truth. Should’ve been $799 for xtx, $649 for XT or something like that, would hurt rdna2 sales ofcourse but all nvidia has to do is drop 4080 a couple hundred dollars or Mayb not even that and it would seriously mess with the sales again",

Radeons are primarily gaming cards, meanwhile Nvidia has a pretty strong foothold in many industries and especially 3090/4090 are very attractive pieces to add to workstation by any 3D generalist.

From his own articles rasterization performance:\n\n>We'll start with the 4K results since that's the most demanding scenario, and CPU bottlenecks can come into play at lower resolutions. \nRTX 3090 takes a modest 8% lead, though the devil’s in the details. Of the 13 games, ten have the 3090 in front, leading by anywhere from 2% (Far Cry 5) to 25% (Strange Brigade). Three games (Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Borderlands 3, and Forza Horizon 4) end up favoring AMD, with Valhalla looking suspect at lower resolutions. Drop to 1440p, and the RTX 3090's lead shrinks to just 1%, effectively tied. \nThe RX 6900 XT now leads in six of the games, though several are basically tied. Valhalla meanwhile jumps to a 30% lead, and as an AMD-promoted game, that's an obvious concern. On the other hand, the 3090's biggest lead comes in Strange Brigade, which is also an AMD-promoted game. Finally, at 1080p, the 6900 XT takes the overall lead by 4%, still leading in half of the games but with very large margins in Valhalla and Horizon Zero Dawn.\n\nTL;DR the 3090 only really beats the 6900XT consistently at ray tracing, which everyone already knew.",

Or like the 4500, which is likely just a batch of leftover Zen 2 chiplets that had cache defects.\n\nThe 7900XT is both an attempt to recoup money on bad stock, as well as acting serving as the [\"decoy\"](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-medium-size-tricks-you-2014-5) to get you to either help AMD move more 7900XTX's (\"it's only $100-200 more!\") or clear old stock (\"the 6950XT is $200-300 less!\").",

AMD seems very confident that with 20 GB and a slightly cut-down MCM chip, they will sit in a comfortable position against the RTX 4090 and may even outperform it in pure rasterization performance while bringing a big jump in RT performance versus the existing RDNA 2 GPUs.\n\nI *still* have my doubts about this but usually when more and more people start saying the same things (Kimi first hinted it with his polls, then Greymon said it, and now WCCFTech)... well maybe there is a chance after all. But maybe just waiting for Nov 3rd is the best stance to take in this situation.",
      "Yeah I kind of wanted to get the 6950xt to meme on my old Radeon 6950.",
      "If this is true it is an unprecedented move from AMD. Their strategy for ages, has been to release the flagship chip in full fat form. 6900XT was full Navi 21, vega 64 was full 10, Fury X was full Fiji, 290X was full Hawaii, 7970 was full Tahiti, 6970 was full cayman and so on. The only time they brought a cut down chip was with Radeon VII but that was a special case, they did it because they wanted to avoid cannibalization of their own pro cards and that card was of limited scope anyway.\nDeciding to compete vs 4090 with a cut down chip shows A LOT of confidence.",
      "Yes",
      "Ah my baby, got destroyed from The Witcher 3.",
      "Knowing amd they will show charts of how 16 gb is not enough for 4k and you need 20 gb now.",
      "I’m expecting $1100. Then they can say a 6900XT crushes the 4080 for less money.",
      "The problem here as always is price. AMD probably could add HBM and then the GPU's costs more and everyone is angry.",
      "Chips are made out of “wafers”, silicon discs that get “carved on”. Each wafer can be made into hundreds of chips but the production process isn’t flawless. Small particles or other factors can affect the tiny transistors in the surface of the wafer which can result in chips that don’t have all their units functioning. Instead of throwing these away, companies deactivate the affected areas and sell them in cut down configurations. In AMD case, a 6900XT was a fully functioning Navi 21 chip, 6800XT was a cut down version of the same chip that had some cores deactivated.",
      "I got a 6800 XT at launch myself! \n\nThere’s dozens of RDNA2 owners.  Dozens!",
      "Double 6950XT core performance, raise TDP, raise clock speed, raise memory speed and bandwidth. If they hit the goal again like RDNA2(6900XT is about exactly double the raw performance of their top RDNA1 card) a ~425W Navi 31 would absolutely at *worst* match a 4090, but *should* be slightly faster.\n\nEDIT: a 6900XT/6950XT has exactly double the specs of the 5700XT. The top Navi 31 die has actually more than double the cores of the 6900 cards(5120 -> 12,280 or something like that).",
      "Sure, but 'Nvidia is toast' just isn't something that's going to happen anytime soon.",
      "You make some really good points. It's also plausible that the reason RDNA2 is still priced where it is is because there isn't that much stock left, so they are trying to get the largest margins they can...unlike Nvidia who has a year's supply still. And yea, they could probably drop prices once RDNA3 is showcased.\n\nGuess we'll see in a couple weeks. I fully plan on buying a 7800xt or 7900xt...but I won't reward stupid pricing. I got the 6800xt  for MSRP because it was an *extremely* fair price for the performance you got from an 8 series. I'm hoping AMD can continue that. Otherwise I will pass."

I estimated that thermal expansion and the pads were causing the core to have less ideal contact, and it appears that was the case.\n* Replaced thermal putty with ptm 7958-sp. This was a paste I applied to the core, let cure for a few hours, and then reassembled the GPU.\n\nEven for this run, the hotspot was still in the 90s, but that's 550w of power being cooled on air (Heck, hwinfo reported like a 670w \"GPU Power Maximum\" at one point, holy shit, but I dunno if to believe that)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 430w power limit I'm still sitting like 62/82.

Maybe it's stacked chips, maybe it's a Ray Tracing Die (RTD) alongside the MCD and GCD, or atop one or the other.

It’s also the same reason why AMD are so slow to launch the 7800xt and lower.

      "AI is sorta weird.\n\nAn average consumer can't really make money off that. You can use it with StableDiffusion to make some fun pictures and memes but their monetary value is about $0. At higher grade - like, say, game development - you also don't really need any computer clusters for this, there are no streamlined tools and processes and output you get is kinda garbage. \n\nWhereas professional grade cards require specs way beyond any home class GPU. anyway Want to run GPT-4 locally? Well, a decent language model needs 400GB VRAM. As in - 5x A100 80GB cards for $12000 each.\n\nYou are a Radeon user? Well, screw you then, best you can have is ROCm with 30% increased memory consumption and 50% higher chance of crashing compared to Nvidia.\n\nBoth AMD and Nvidia have already \"secured\" their consumer grade cards from AI training, it's a completely different stock with significantly altered feature set - 20-24GB VRAM sounds like plenty for a consumer but for a datacenter this is woefully insufficient.\n\nPlus you can't really use any sort of AI by just renting an office room and shoving 50 GPU setup in there, a very common scenario in the mining era. Instead you would need to be a billion $ business with top of the line PhD researchers to advance your chosen field of study - be it sound synthesis, image generation, anomalies detect, medicine and whatnot. Barrier of entry to the lucrative part of the market is extremely high making it significantly different from mining.\n\nSo it doesn't explain any sort of rise in GPU pricing. Your usual home class card would never become a capable AI device - you would need major infrastructural changes. Sure, one can argue that you could just build these instead of consumer ones but... demand is also not as huge as you may imagine for now. There's also a severe shortage of skilled workers that can make any use of these which significantly limits growth (and it's probably why for instance you hear about Elon Musk whining that such development should be stopped for 6 months cuz he couldn't secure his piece of the cake yet).",

      ">But buying into it today at this price is just not worth the saving\n\nI would disagree with this assessment but it depends on what you're doing with it. It's generally 4080-4090 levels of performance for 20-50% less money and with more VRAM than anything except a 4090 which is nice for loading large ML models if that's your bag.\n\nThere are other nice to haves as well. DisplayPort 2.1, USB-C so you can use PSVR2 without an adaptor, normal power connectors.\n\n>gimped RT performance \n\nBe honest, how often are you playing a ray tracing game? In the very few games where RT adds anything the 7900XTX performs around [3080](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-benchmark-test-performance-analysis/6.html) to [3090ti ](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/avatar-fop-performance-benchmark/5.html)levels which is hardly 'gimped'.\n\n>the worst upscaling solution on the market\n\nIt supports TAA, TSR, IGTI, XeSS, FSR, and whatever other custom temporal upscalers exist. The only upscaler it doesn't support is NVIDIA's proprietary DLSS. Not that that matters much since FSR 3.1 is [very close in quality and performance](https://www.techspot.com/review/2860-amd-fsr-31-versus-dlss/) and we know AMD is [continuing to invest in FSR](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-plans-for-fsr4-to-be-fully-ai-based-designed-to-improve-quality-and-maximize-power-efficiency).\n\n>I bet you anything in the next two years, if you are targeting around 90fps, 4070 TiS will give you better visuals\n\nAnd I bet you that in two years time the limited 12GB VRAM on the 4070Ti will result in some sub-optimal gameplay experiences. Avatar already hits 12GB in 1080p Ultra, The Last of Us Part 1 hits 13GB at 1080p Ultra.\n\nThe 4070Ti Super with 16GB is much better off but even that's also going to start hitting walls in 2-3 years.\n\nIt's hard to have better visuals when you're running out of VRAM and have to drop settings.",

    "selftext": "\nSo for context I have a 13700k that I bought at the beginning of 2023 and a 7900xtx. Well unfortunately I suffered from the intel stability issue about a half of a year in that caused major instability, performance issues, and other problems that got worse over time. So earlier this year I had to finally RMA the chip as it finally just like gave out even on complete stock settings. So I get the new processor and I can finally use my computer like I wanted without crashing every couple hours and everything seems okay at face value until I start gaming. \n\nNow on not very demanding games such as Skyrim, Pathfinder games, Fallout 4, and the like it was running fine but anything newer than like 2022 was a hit or miss if it ran well on my computer. I was stumped, everyone seemed to having a grand ole time on specs equal and worse than mine. I wasn’t able to get through like 10 minutes without having unexplainable frame drops or hitching and stuttering during gaming. Turns out after a period of not gaming for awhile due to college I find the motherboard I upgraded to (Z790-F gaming WiFi), since presumably I bought it, had a broken PCIE slot which was limiting my card to PCIE x1 4.0 instead of x16 and wouldn’t change no matter the load.\n\nNeedless to say I was not happy after the discovery and my own ignorance. Ended up RMAing the motherboard and rebuilding and holy moly the rig works beautifully for like the first time in over a year. And hot diggity damn the 7900xtx is way faster than I ever thought it’s unreal. I can’t believe put up with that for like a year.\n\nCheck your PCIE speed people, don’t be like me. \n\nTLDR: had to RMA a faulty CPU due to stability and performance issues only for them to remain, find out it’s also the motherboard running at the wrong PCIE link speed cause the slot is broken.",

      "FWIW I’m on a 9800X3D with a 7900XTX as well, but based on the motherboard design and my needs for storage, I have the card only running x8. Games still cruise at max raster settings on all kinds of stuff from CS2 to Satisfactory at well over 100 fps at 4K. The card is an absolute beast, and while I could move cards around to favor GPU slot data rate over storage rate, benchmarks suggest it wouldn’t make much difference going to x16, so I’m leaving it be for now.\n\n(My motherboard is a Gigabyte x870 variant.)",

(first PC I built myself).\n\nI always had a feeling that I was underperforming in some games, but benchmark scores in 3D Mark, Unigine Superposition etc. were normal, so I thought it was all in my head.\n\nThen when a friend with identical specs and settings was getting 100 FPS more than me in CS 2 I was finally convinced something was up. I spent days trying to figure out what the problem was, reinstalling the game, the drivers, Windows, everything. I had given up. Until one day I was looking through my glass panel, and it finally hit me.\n\nWhen I switched to the correct slot, the gains I made in FPS felt as if I upgraded my GPU, like a free Christmas gift to myself.",

They refused to believe me that my CPU could have died. \n\nThey had me show proof of the CPU sitting in the socket of two motherboards (causing me to have to rip my existing computers apart), and then after that they had me, a week later, do it again but this time holding my case number in the photo. Then they wanted all sorts of pictures in the box. \n\nThey tried to tell me that is user error or that my power supply had issues. It was the longest back and forth ever, sometimes of them repeating stuff I’ve already done or sent.

One incident was so bad we had to replace the motherboard, RAM, battery, bottom cover, and palmrest.  The user didn't shutdown the computer, and wasn't asked to, opened the bottom cover at the request of the OEM tech support, didn't manage to unscrew every screw and pried open the bottom, breaking the bottom cover and cracking the palmrest, he then disconnected the CMOS battery, not the main battery cable, then unscrewed the heatsink from the CPU while the system was hot and running, dropping the screw on the live board and shorting out the entire system, catching the battery cable on fire.\n\nI had to fight the OEM for all of five minutes to accept responsibility.  The tech support guy naturally said that if the end user wasn't comfortable doing it he shouldn't have, and I said tech support can't ask the end user to open their device without accepting the risk that the end user might inadvertently cause another issue.  The tech spoke to their higher level support and immediately accepted my position and sent out every part I requested.  Unfortunately, I wasn't the one that got to fix the system 😞",

      "Lots of misinformation and the usual snide comments here. You can tell when no one has any actual experience with something.\n\nStar Citizen's performance is not as bad as it used to be, nor is it as bad as people jeer about in comments.\n\nI'm on a 6900 XT, run at 1728 or 1800, and get upper 50's FPS on average. It's near enough to 60 that I have Chill enabled for the game because some areas will go above that. If I run at 1440p then the game's performance is generally smooth across the board unless the server is chugging hard.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nRamble for more info, if you're interested:\n\nPresently what matters the most in Star Citizen is the CPU rather than the GPU. Think of it as an MMO in terms of performance behavior rather than a first person shooter and you'll know what the performance is like. Whether someone wants to classify it as an \"MMO\" or not is irrelevant, I'm just talking about performance. In this regard, if you get something like the 5800X3D (or a more recent equivalently performing CPU) then you're going to get significantly higher frame rates.\n\nPatch 3.18, which is currently on a separate additional test server, has the first iteration of the Gen 12 renderer which off-loads some of the CPU work onto the GPU. If someone is currently CPU bound in SC then 3.18 can improve their performance somewhat, though I haven't seen numbers to know exactly how much of an improvement this has been. Basically, they're moving away from the existing aging renderer to Vulkan for improved performance, visuals, and the option to add modern things like HDR, VR, et al.\n\nBut if you don't have access to 3.18 yet or you don't have a better CPU, then there are also numerous INI tweaks that can be done, as is typically the case with PC gaming. Just do a YouTube search for Star Citizen Performance Guide or the like and you'll find them. The one that says 3.17.2 FPS+++ in the thumbnail is my favorite because it doesn't waste too much time with fluff in the video and the description has the necessary info, but the others probably work fine. Follow it and the game doesn't look like poo, though you're obviously trading some visuals for performance, and it will run much better.\n\nWhat you're going to see in the comments are a lot of people who remember when no amount of hardware could push the game beyond 30 FPS. Some will claim this is still the case. Those people have no idea what they're talking about, or have really bad hardware, or refuse to do any INI tweaks because they feel like \"They shouldn't have to do that\". In a PC game. As though this has never been the case in PC gaming. 🙄\n\nPersonally I get my aforementioned FPS without doing the INI tweaks and this is almost entirely because of the CPU.\n\nThere are some very real issues to complain about with SC but performance, if you've been gaming on the PC for any length of time and know how to edit a text file, really isn't one of those issues.",
      "I play everyday past two years idk what people on internet think",

It's admittedly 60fps capped, but got it to run that stable with all settings maxed out.\n\nOne snag I've run into - was [trying to get a run of Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK/blob/main/shark/examples/shark_inference/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_amd.md) but it doesn't look like the RDNA3 driver supports MLIR/IREE yet so no dice :( (garbage output in fp16 mode, IREE compiler error in fp32 mode). Sure enough the last MLIR/IREE driver was a month ago and only 5000/6000 cards. Will try with DirectML (which is *much* slower) tomorrow.\n\nEdit2: Did in fact get DirectML Stable Diffusion working [following this guide](https://gist.github.com/averad/256c507baa3dcc9464203dc14610d674),\n\n    12152022-145016 - Model: C:\\Users\\LordAlfredo\\Stable Diffusion\\model\\stable_diffusion_onnx Scheduler: PNDMScheduler\n    12152022-145016 - Inference Steps: 64 Guidance Scale: 10 Width: 512 Height: 512\n    12152022-145131 - Seed: 277436425 - Gen Time: 40.4030237197876s\n\nCaps out at 768x768 generation (at that point I'm at full VRAM usage).

This thing is a fp16 compute *beast*, 50 iteration 512x512 image generation finishes in ~30-40 seconds!\n\nEdit 3: Finally hit an OC instability crash in 2 hours of Cyberpunk w/ a second monitor running.

Any movement on the voltage slider for example core clocks shoot up but scores go way down.

Talk of 2x performance boosts and 'almost 4GHz GPUs' clearly let down some fans and rather unfairly, took the sheen away from AMD's actual achievements, which are highly impressive in many ways.\n\nSame thing every time. The rumor mill surrounding AMD is always toxic as fuck.",

It's actually 2x performance and 3GHz clock speeds\"\n\nNobody seriously thought Navi 31 would hit 4GHz - the sensible speculation saw it around 3.2GHz before overclocking, and up to 1.8x perf. Way off, but still nowhere near 4GHz.\n\nLikewise, the only people who said Lovelace's RT perf would be 3x or 4x the 3090 Ti's was Nvidia. The leaks all suggested 2x-2.5x. Even they were off - it's about 1.8x on average at 4K, it looks like.",

It'll have better raster performance (?), worse ray tracing performance (?), and the FSR3 and \"frame interpolation\" features won't arrive until sometime next year.  \n\nDisruptive would've been a 4090 competitor below the 4080 price point of 1200 USD, or a 4080 competitor below the \"4070\" 12 GB price point of 900 USD.\n\nPeople will debate which product to buy based on use case, but it will settle in right next to Nvidia's offerings rather than disrupt anything.",

      "No, $1k is still a high asking price but people are happy including myself because its alot less tha Nvidia, if it was priced at $700 then it would indeed disrupt the market.\n\nSo we have no option but just bite the bullet and accept these prices",
      "Exactly because like 95% of people using a console don't even know what hardware is inside, which is fine it's just a more casual demographic. Typically if you tend to care about PC hardware on an enthusiast level you're much more likely to get into PC gaming vs console.\n\nEven at the ultra-enthusiast level where people know AMD is a good option Nvidia dominates. I think when you get to this level of people paying $1000+ for a graphics card the mindset is they want the absolute best they can get which tends to be Nvidia. That's why you see heavily discounted 6900XTs and the like right now because AMD is having a hard time getting enthusiasts to buy them.\n\nObviously they need to have products at the high end of their product stack but I think they need to more aggressively market to the mid and low end markets looking to buy GPUs."

      "Has anyone ever seen a **$1,000 card with a cooler from that of a $500 card** in previous generations?\n\nForreal, **massive disappointment in AMD**. They clearly developed the 7900 XTX in the same vein as the 6900 while not anticipating the massive jump between Nvidia 3000 and 4000 series. So while the previous X900 segment, the **6900 was close to 3090 with 6950 matching 3090ti, now it can only match the 4080 in raster. And light years away from 4090.**\n\nMeanwhile, everybody knew to expect worse off RT but the gap is 30%-40% worse in RT + only matching 4080 in raster + a barely okay cooler that gets **84C memory temps under load in open air test bench**. $200 doesn't justify this, it needs to be much cheaper and not just a little cheaper, and AIB coolers will fix this but at $60-$100 price jump which makes the value proposition a joke.\n\nThe 7900 XTX offers no real value compared to 4080 when you factor in same raster + RT + crappy barely okay cooler. And buying AIB 7900 XTX (@ $1050-1100) is just insane when you can spend a little more over AIB models to get even better thermals from 4080 Fe (specc'd for 650 watts) and vastly superior RT.\n\nThe 7900 XTX is really more like 7800XT and should be price at $800.\n\nAMD clearly saw their competitor increase their prices and took the opportunity to do the same even though their **product segmentation is vastly inferior, slipping from 3090ti competitor to 4080 competitor**. They saw their chance to increase their prices and they did while claiming to offer value, but if you consider the RT difference and the cooler difference, the value isn't there. It needs to be even more cheaper to offer real value.\n\nThe 4080 FE's insane cooler designed for 650 watt 4090 runs at low rpms even under load, meanwhile the 7900 XTX with Gamer's Nexus testing hits 84C memory temp on a open air test bench.\n\nIf you are spending close to $1100 for AIB RX 7900 XTX then there's no reason for you not to spend $100 more to get 40% better RT from 4080 FE and even better thermals than AIB 7900 XTX as I doubt even $1100 AIB cards will have coolers specc'd for 650 watts.",

      "Anyone that can shell out $1000 on gaming gpu, will want to have RT. The same people will pay a slightly more for a much better RT.",
      "It is a real thing but only for high-end cards and still won't leave raster in the past until the next gen of consoles, who should be able to do RT much better than the current ones - and they dictate the market, basically.\n\nMost RT games barely have any significant visual impact (implementations like in FarCry 6 do not count), and the ones who do (Cyberpunk-like) need a significant drop in resolution/FPS to achieve it on anything below 4080 - which you may or you may not take - up to a point it's debatable and depends on each individual.\n\nIt's disappointing from a 999$ part, nonetheless, **but the raster performance of just equaling the 4080 is much more disappointing than the RT one** if you ask me.",
      "I've been waiting on this review to pull the trigger on a new card. I'm still on a EVGA 8GB 1070ti, which has performed valiantly over the years. I've been trying to push it into 1440p gaming but it's limping along at this point.\n\nReading the other replies and I feel like I'm missing something. At 1440p/RT/Ultra on the worst title benchmarked (CyberPunk) it ran close to 80fps. And neither 4080 nor 7900xtx can hit the 120fps with these settings so consistent/high 60fps+ seems like the best you can do at the price tier. As a 1440p gamer, that looks good to me. Not to mention it'll trade blows with 4080 on raster going forward. \n\nOthers are saying it's not worth $1000 tag, but at that price what is a better value? Why would I spend extra $200 just for an nvidia brand at this point? I get that $1000 is a large sum of money in the absolute but in the GPU market comparing with what else is available I'm probably still going with this one over the 4080 or the older gen 3090.",

After COVID and mining made RX 6000 a mess for consumers (and AMD, since supply restrictions kept then from meeting demand), it really feels like AMD hamstrung Radeon with high prices this generation.\n\nOn both sides, AMD and Nvidia, I don't know anyone with a current-gen card. Most everyone got priced out of real upgrades or had their interest in DIY severely diminished by how GPUs rocketed upmarket this generation.",

That's my ideology.\n\nThis is my philosophy too, when it comes to these things. I'm in a few hardware sales subreddits and it's so frustrating to see people eternally \"waiting for next gen\" just hoping to save $50 on this-or-that. I get it. It makes sense in some situations. But the way I look at it is, if I buy it now, versus six months from now (assuming it goes on sale) - will six months of enjoyment with it be worth $50? I think it is. 28 cents a day? That's a fair trade, I think.\n\nI hope that made sense.",
      "This is more or less how I feel. Even with a real desire to replace my 1080ti I just hate the options right now. Considering my lack of a console I'd almost rather buy a PS5 Pro when it comes out than a new video card right now.",

    "selftext": "This is a short and sweet post but honestly looking at the reviews for the 4080, I'm hoping the 7900 XT(X) really hits the nail on the head. For some of the numbers, I've watched from reviewers like LTT, GN, and J2C all the 7900 series cards need to just perform at least 1.3x the performance of the 6950XT to equal or outperform the 4080 in everything. 1080 to 4k rez. I do think a 30% uplift is possible be it AMD says they can get up to a 67% bump in performance with recent charts. Time will tell but I think I'm becoming a full AMD boy by next month. (BTW This is all super simple look at numbers and then multiply by 1.3x) Damn, I love competition.\n\nEdit: (12/12) Circling in back to this post since the benchmarks are out. Raster performance looks to be on average compared to the 4080 which is great! Sometimes higher sometimes lower. Obviously RT is hurting bad and I don't see that performance getting a crazy uplift so it seems AMD will always be 1-2 gens behind with RT. All we can hope is the drivers are stable and constantly updated as well. I do believe that Nvidia will drop the 4080 to $999. I cant see a future where they don't so it'll then become a battle between team green or team red. AMD IS STIRING THE POT!",
    "comments": [
      "Let's just hope they bring competitive pricing too. The XTX is priced well for a flagship, but I'm wary of the XT being $900. We'll see what everything ends up being.",
      "By \"7800xt\" you mean the real 7700xt? Right? Because AMD is doing the same thing Nvidia did with RTX 4080 12GB. Higher price point for the lower tier card so they switch the names around.\n\nRX 7900 XT should have been called RX 7800 XT.",
      "If AMD's official benchmarks are close to reality, which it should be.\n\n7900XT should more or less match 4080.  XTX should be within 10% of 4090.  This is traditional performance only of course.  We will be one full generation behind on ray tracing.  DLSS is better than FSR too.\n\nObviously AMD doesn't want to compare against 4090 directly because XTX loses in every metric except price, but overall it should be a strong alternative.\n\nIf you look at Steam, 3070 and up vs 6700 and up, Nvidia has 10 to 1 lead in hardware survey.  I hope AMD can close the gap to something like 4 to 1 or even 3 to 1, one year from today on 4000 vs 7000.",
      "The issue is that Nvidia has so much mindshare, it might not even matter.  \nI see so many people on discord and other social spaces only looking at the new nvidia cards and complaining about prices without even considering getting an AMD card instead.",
      "Honestly, if the XTX is within 10% of 4090 perf while costing $600 less, that IS a win for AMD.",
      "Nvidia is being greedy and planning for an inevitable 4080 Ti to bridge that performance gap. The gap between the 3080 and 3090 was much smaller, but it also meant that people didnt buy the 3080 Ti.",
      "You'll also see lots of people on Reddit lambasting Nvidia and claiming they're going AMD, only to just go ahead and buy Nvidia anyway.",
      "I think many people aren't aware of the fact that AMD is already the better dollar per performance option and still not dominating for various reasons. I can't think of a reason why this gen would 8nherently change this",
      "Provided the 7800xt is similar price to last gen I'll be happy",
      "It's just longtime fans who are still stuck in the Underdog frame of mind. \n\nAMD has been a raw raster *and* price value king for the last two generations, and it resulted in practically no change in their market share. The 3060 alone outsold all of RDNA2, for example. \n\nIt's not enough to just be cheaper and comparably performant at regular raster performance. There's so much more that AMD need to catch up on before casual gamers start taking them seriously. \n\nRT for example. This sub can shit on it all they want, but regardless of whether someone intends to turn on RT or not, they'll still want a GPU that won't shit the bed on the off chance they decide to try it out. And right now, Nvidia is basically double the performance of AMD in that space; I can see why some might go Nvidia despite higher prices because of that.\n\nThink about it; if you have Nvidia card A and AMD card A, and you wanted something cheaper but still RT-performant, you could just go down one tier to Nvidia card B, and *still beat the RT performance of AMD card A while spending less than both Nvidia card A and AMD card A.* All while still having access to stuff like DLSS, NVENC, CUDA etc in the rare off chance you decide to exploit those features.",
      "I'm just saying, RX 6800 XT is the same GPU class as 6900 XT and 6950 XT.\n\nRX 7800 XT will NOT be the same GPU class as 7900 XT and 7900 XTX. It's pretty obvious what has been done here but nobody is raising alarms because it's AMD so they get a pass for something that is literally the same as what Nvidia did to the point where Nvidia had to \"unlaunch\" their 4080 12GB due to backlash.",
      "Everyone acts like their friends and family will rush to buy a 1k GPU on here lol. Even if it’s competitive it won’t matter in the grand scheme of the market. Nvidia and AMD most profitable GPUs are the midrange. There’s over 5xs the amount of 3060 over 3080 and the 3080 was $700. Thinking that a 1k GPU will somehow turn the market is being delusional. These 1k+ cards won’t even break 1% of the market share.",
      "All they want from AMD is to get them to lower Intel and Nvidia prices. At least on the cpu side, AMD are firmly established as a equal quality product after the 5000 series.",
      "It realistically wont be though. It will maybe get there or even match the 4090 in some games, but some others will get demolished. People are doing all kinds of mental gymnastics but the reality is that when you start averaging a large amount of game all with their engines and bottlenecks (cpu or otherwise) the average performance goes down. Even the 4090 is not well represented because the faster you are the more bottlenecked you get.",
      "Same. If the performance uplift from 6700xt to 7700xt is trash then I'll just get a 6800/xt. I'm tired of these normalized prices/upsell tactics.",
      "It's amazing how people are already jumping to conclusions months in advance with zero knowledge.",
      "That too yeah.  \nKinda like people saying they will boycott a popular new game and still buy it on release.",
      "Yes, as was the whole 5000 series line. I have no idea what they’re talking about. I bought my 5600x at full price and I know several others who did too, it was a great value at the time.",
      "I won't even consider a 4080 because of the massive cooler sizes. And I would rather get Nvidia at comparable prices. But I will seriously look at AMD this generation.",
      "If that's the case I'll prolly just go with 6800xt"
