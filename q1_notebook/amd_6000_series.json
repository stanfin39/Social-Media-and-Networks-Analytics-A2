Before these 6600XTs, I had 3 Nvidia cards in a row and I can say that they feel as stable as Nvidia cards. Maybe overclocking, undervolting and tweaking in general I would give an edge to Nvidia.

It would blackscreen and restart my computer multiple times a day, and many posters would say that my 750w platinum rated PSU was the issue (lol). Along with countless other \"fixes\", OS wipes, drivers with DDU, etc.\n\nSo what did I do? I bought the highest rated power supply I could find at microcenter, wiped my OS, and it still failed. Fine. Maybe my motherboard has issues with the card. I built a second computer out of older parts and that power supply and guess what, it still failed. At this point, I have tried multiple hw configs, drivers, and countless OS wipes. At one point, an AMD employee recruited me to a dev discord and sent me new drivers and tools to record the issue. This went on for a few months but no beta driver helped me. To note, so many people on the two subs were having these exact issues - this was not an isolated issue.\n\nAbout 3 months later, I RMA the card to powercolor, who after 2 weeks, they find 0 issues with it. I get it back, furious, so I forgo ever putting it back into a system, and sell it at a good price with an obvious caution \"had issues with it, but Powercolor says there is nothing wrong with it\".\n\nI buy a 2070 super and have had 0 issues. No reboots, no black screens, no crashes, artifacts, anything ever. It's been about 6 months since then. I sincerely hope the person who bought that card has had 0 issues with it. I still love AMD as a company, but the entire experience left a terrible taste in my mouth because nobody took blame for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I now realize that I haven't posted since swapped cards, I still have the 5700xt as my flair lol.",

      "Every single driver released since May is completely unable to properly render Motion Smoothing for ANYONE, an essential effect in some highly demanding VR games.

    "selftext": "AMD have given an MSRP on this card and promised a few things--\n\n1.) $199 MSRP (actual available price targeted)\n\n2.) Large available quantity at launch.  Lisa Su:\n\n>We’re positioning the launch such that—and I know, you guys always say, ’Well, yeah, they’re just saying that’—but we really are positioning the launch at a $199 price point. It is sort of affordable to the mainstream. You know, we intend to have a lot of product out there.\n\n3.) Its no good for mining and according to AMD, that was an intentional part of the design.\n\nNumber 3 above is key.  If this is true (and it will be tested, I can assure you), then miners wont be buying truckloads of them-- they shouldnt actually be buying any at all.  Again, this means that anyone selling these tomorrow at above MSRP are outright scalping /scalpers.  In normal times, this is a $160 card, at best.  Its gimped in mem capacity, gimped in hardware video codecs, gimped in PCIe lanes/bandwidth.  Consider that if you are thinking of caving in and paying more than $200.  Dont do it.\n\nIf you purchase one of these cards for anything more than a penny over $200 USD, you are supporting  and encouraging scalping, period.  This should not be able to be blamed on miners. Do not pay more than that at Amazon, Newegg, Best Buy, Microcenter, etc, and for DAMNED SURE do not pay more than that on Ebay or some hardware swap forum.\n\nShow some backbone and say no to scalping once and for all.  Make the scalpers who purchased multiple cards with the intent of flipping them sell for a loss.  Send a message to the AIBs that its not OK to upcharge 50% of what a product should cost just because they slap a \"superclocked\" or \"OC edition\" label on it. If the community doesnt unite and take a stand against this BS it will never stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*EDIT:  There are already some people trying to justify higher prices by saying that \"Oh, the AIB versions will have a bigger cooler, etc, so they will be more expensive.\"  BULLSHIT.  AIB cards are the only ones that are being sold and Lisa's comments about targeted street price of $200 already take this into account.  That means that AMD has sold these GPUs to AIBs at a low enough price that $200 should cover everything else they need to produce the card and still make a profit.  Dont fall for that BS.  This is a tiny die, on a tiny card, with a tiny amount of memory.  It doesnt need a  triple fan Arctic Frozr cooler or some exotic liquid cooling shit on it, dont be that gullible.**",

      "People should also note here, this card is not worth MSRP, let alone above it, it has been gimped in too many ways, (Not to prevent mining, so they can cut costs producing it and increase the margin on it), AMD saying its to prevent mining is a PR stunt, nothing more (Unless someone fancies telling me how gimping the PCIE lanes and memory bus also help 'prevent mining' when the 4gb vram is already in place)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are a gamer on a budget (Which realisitcally if you're looking at this card, you are), don't bother, get a current generation console. These are easier to buy than GPUs, are more powerful than this GPU, and will cost less (Comparing total system cost).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point of the PC platform is to give a premium experience over consoles for a premium price, this card represents a premium price for a worse experience \n\nYou aren't really getting the freedom of framerate and resolution here, even settings tweaks really, and you're below the XSX/PS5 performance tier so what's the point in buying it more than those systems cost",
      "Supposedly somewhere around RX 580-ish.",
      "Even MSRP seems like too much honestly. Unless they can get it to run at full speed at PCI-E 3.0 x4 and is meaningfully faster than the 5500 XT, this card is going to be terrible at 200, but with how messed up the market it, I'm sure it will sold out even at 400."

If the 6500 XT wasn't so gimped or the 3050 was priced accordingly, this would be a completely different conversation.  \n\n\nWelcome to 2022, where \"best value\" basically means \"this purchase will dick you over the ***least ...*** but it will still give you the D.\"  Fingers crossed that Intel releases a reasonably priced budget card.",

Both the 3060 and 3060ti cost a lot more. The market changes and so most the perspective of reviewers. \n\nI would like to get a high end GPU for 350CHF (like my r9 fury), but it will take a lot of time for that to happen.",

Significant adjustments in retail pricing aside, the RX 6600 is still an expensive 5600 XT with shitty ray tracing performance, while the second thumbnail is now correct, dropping to $450 US makes it the best value GPU in the current market.\n\nUpon release the RX 6600 didn't look impressive, pricing didn't sound as though it was going to be remotely interesting and it wasn't, so what did you want the thumbnail to say? \"The probably crap value RX 6600 is here?\"",

      "Except the 6600 and 6600 XT were both called bad value cards at launch by most reviewers, so them being bad cards as a result was indeed part of most of the launch reviews of those GPUs. It's only more recently that reviewers who shit on the 6600 XT are having second thoughts about it.",

Micro Center had plenty available near MSRP, even had cards left at the end of the day. \n\nHowever, there is no guarantee this will continue to be the case in terms of both quantity and pricing. In fact, the pattern from the 3060 and 6700xt launches were that they had cards near MSRP on launch day but almost only expensive ones later on. Given that even the 6700xt is selling for $800+ from most board partners, I would not be shocked at 6600xt going above $600-650. \n\nWith all the reviewers’ complaints about the $379 MSRP, they forget that getting this card actually at $379 is an absolute bargain in this market, and probably only likely to happen on launch day. The correct advise to their audience should have been to get one at MSRP on launch day if at all possible and just sell your RX580 or GTX 1060.",

There may be some GPU performance impact depending on the connector but it's so small you won't notice it anyway.\n\nEdit: for my own anecdote, I'm running a reference 6900XT and a corsair RM 850x that comes with daisy chain connectors. The wire from the PSU to the first connector is much higher gauge than the chained connector.\n\nI have no performance difference using either 2 separate 8-pin or a single daisy chain. The heat in the wire measured 1 degree higher which is not much and within error of the indirect thermometer I was using.\n\nSo it really depends on the PSU and again, I doubt any PSU maker would risk the liability of not having more than adequate daisy connectors."

AMD keeps shitting on the $200 market and has done so for the past few generations; no Vega model, RX 5500XT, and now the RX 6500.   It's sad when a 5-6 year old card outperforms a brand new offering that should blow it out of the water.",

Your flair says you already have a 6700XT so really it won't affect you, just like 99.95% of commenters shitting on it that will never own one any way, this isn't aimed at ANY OF US it's just to get more cards out the door in shitty bottom barrel prebuilts, and NOBODY buying one of those is seriously contemplating \"streaming\".",
      "The issue is, if someone is buying a '$200\" GPU they likely have a really old, slow performing CPU. People aren't going to pair these with a modern Zen 3 or 12th gen CPU, but likely a 5+ year old budget one.\n\nSo it absolutely becomes an issue.",

      "The explanation I have seen is that both the x4 interface and the lack of hardware encoding is because it's a notebook GPU repurposed for desktop. Notebooks don't need a hardware encoder on the GPU because the iGPU already have one, and they use PCI-E x4.",

      "I don’t understand how 3050 prices have stayed so elevated as everything else drops, the cheapest on Newegg is $330. That’s arguably even worse value than a $200 6500XT.\n\nMeanwhile the friend I just helped build is very satisfied with his $250 6600.",
      "the 6600 & 6600XT are pretty much the default choice for 1080p gaming right now, unless you can get a 3060Ti for around the same price as the former two cards.",
      "If you did the numbers at the MSRP, it's literally just a faster 6500xt. 20-30% faster for about 25% increased price. And that was *if* you could get it at Nvidia's MSRP, which we all know is a joke\n\nMeanwhile the 3060 and 6600 were practically 2 times more powerful for 50% increase in price. 3050 is genuinely a worthless card",
      "3060Ti could've been the people's card for this gen if not for fucking miners.",
      "I have a 3050. It lives in my unraid server and it transcodes plex and does some rendering work. It replaced a 1060 6gb with a net influx of 50 bucks in cash. So effectively a free upgrade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAMD didn't have anything that I could do this with. All their cards at that price range don't have proper encoders. OpenCL is also a joke and no proper rendering software really supports AMD over CUDA.\n\nThat's the realistic niche for this card. It's unfortunate AMD doesn't have much to compete with it.",
      "Yep the only thing new we learn from this video is that AMD card prices keep tanking even below MSRP and somehow 3050 prices still above MSRP. About the performance part from the moment they come out from all the review we already knew that 6600 1 tier above and closer to the 3060/3060Ti/6600xt (hence the name) than the 3050.",

It 'SHOULD' be a replacement for the 1650 Super in Nvidias product stack with similar performance but with RTX and DLSS features added (despite how fairly useless they may be in most games on this card, there are some low-demand games that will still work well with DLSS at 1080p like esports titles). \n\nBut at $300 it's ridiculous",
      "Mining is dead and nvidia cards still overly overpriced. RTX 3050 is 330€ for the most basic model, which is just absolutely nuts when you can buy RX 6600 for 300€. RTX 3060Ti is also pricy as hell here + it's quite power hungry for what it is which will start matter soon with skyrocketing electricity prices in Europe (which were already like double the US prices).",

      ">I don’t understand how 3050 prices have stayed so elevated as everything else drops\n\nI would guess that AIB's sold them to retailers for higher costs, and now since the crypto crash and with demand dropping out hard, retailers are hoping to not have to discount cards below what they paid for them, seeing if they can get some suckers to clear out what they have now.",

The only card I ever had issue with was a 7900 GT, that luckily I bought from EVGA, so it was a quick and easy RMA.\n\nI don't get the diehard siding with one brand over another. Each gen, I read reviews and chose the best bang for my budget. Sometimes its AMD and sometimes it is Nvidia.",

      "I think the problem with this comment is that you didn't mention how larger chips have a higher defective to functional dies ratio per wafer than smaller chips, rendering them more expensive, also you failed to mention that running this chip ant high power could potentially reduce its lifespan as it was made to be efficient at lower voltages and clocks, pushing it this high certainly requires relatively high voltages than what it was designed for, which could lead to chip degradation and failure. Given all that I'd say that it seldom balances out, as a larger die with more cores would give the same performance at a lower voltage compared to this laptop die which is being pushed beyond its efficiency sweet spot. Now while higher voltage doesn't always mean lesser lifespan, it does usually mean less power consumed, which is always nice, if we assume that both dies would pull the same amount of current to achieve their targeted performance.",

It is horribly crippled. But it is crucial to remember that every single component on the card is in short supply or overpriced, even the copper used in the PCB traces is up substantially. Shipping is up substantially. Inflation is up. The design costs for a 6nm part are massive. TSMC has also raised their prices. \n\nI cannot see how it could cost any less.\n\nThe best price NVIDIA can do is $250 on their RTX3050. That is less compromised but it's also more expensive.

And this thing - even though it is mid-tier - is a beast. It pulls FPS close to my friends 1080ti.",

The difference may improve more as Resizable Bar support improves, but even for now a good PCIe3 NVMe isn't much different for increased frames.\n\nPCIe Gen4 is being implemented now for increased storage speed, GPU's weren't at a bottleneck yet on PCIe3. Its only been an issue with newer x4 lane cards like the RX6400, which was more AMD using PCIe4's double the bandwidth to get away with releasing an x4 card.",

      "GPU utilization at 62% tells the story.  That card is not being pushed.",
      "That’s probably why, Tomb Raider isn’t going to stress out a GPU like that too much",
      "Are you capped at 60 fps?",
      "it's also at just 1100 MHz, which means lower power state, and even at that state only 62% of GPU time is used.",
      "This is correct.  Gpu is idling and saving power because it's capping at 60fps. Why frame capping or vsync is good for many games that don't need unlimited fps.",
      "Yeah",
      "That seems to be the consensus. I just switched from a 390 where I'm used to hitting 80c in Tomb Raider. A difference of -30c is baffling to me. Guess I'm not used to all the advances in the new cards. Cheers!",
      "Looks about right , your gpu util is only 60% so not even pushing the card. Plus 6600xt is a low wattage card.",
      "Time to swap back",
      "3 options:\n- Leave as-is, everything is fine\n- Up quality settings to utilize GPU more\n- Get a higher resolution and/or refresh rate monitor to utilize GPU more",
      "Thats one of the uses for vsync",
      "160W TDP doesn’t mean 160W in games at all times.",
      "We've come a long way that's for sure",
      "Lol no wonder then",
      "It's because the framerate is locked to 60fps, so the card and cpu doesn't need to push more.",
      "Correct me if I’m wrong, but high clock with low usages is not bad. \n\nHeat depends on load not clock. \n\nLook at CPU‘s. When you overclock your i9 to 5Ghz it’s not running at 90 Degrees all the time. \n\nAnd the clock is always more stable with low usage. Like you can boot with 5.2 into Windows but Prime is only stable with 5.\n\nI myself cap my FPS to stay in G-Sync range. \nNever had any problems. And GPU Temps are way lower.",
      "Look at the FPS number to see the whole story. OP has vsync on or has manually capped the FPS to 60. Unlock that cap, OP, and your GPU will stretch its legs.",
      "Well that answers your question. If you had the frame rate uncapped, then it would use more power to render more frames.",
      "Tip: 60 is divisible by 120 but not by 144, so if you're going to play at 60 fps you're better off setting that 144hz monitor to 120hz so 60 fps look smooth on it instead if stuttery. Nothing can be done about the resolution though, if it were 2160p you could use Integer Scaling to get 1080p at the same quality of a 1080p monitor, but 1440 isn't an integer number of 1080.\n\nRSR would be perfect for this though, but I doubt the 390 is going to get it. Maybe with modded drivers."

That’s quite a bit extra heat in the case in the first image and can definitely affect results. Of course a LM application should see lower temps regardless so nothing to really see here but not really a scientific process conducted here either.",
      "I thought about that too, but it takes literally seconds for your CPU to reach at least 80% of max temp during load, unless you have a very large cooler. He might just have run another program on the second pic.\n\nBut your theory could be correct as well. I'd just expect a higher CPU temp even for shorter benches.",
      "No idea why. Had the same background apps running. Just a spike I'd guess.\n\nEDIT: looking at that chart it looks like it was running something for at least a minute while taking that shot. Honestly don't know. Maybe Windows updates, or something else. But I don't think it effected GPU temps at all. The VRAM load is the same and they are both at 99% GPU load. Either way I'm not removing the LM to retest lol.",
      "You can run LM safely on a GPU if you know how to apply it correctly.\n\nI have ran and still do Thermal Grizzly Condactonout on all my Ryzen CPU's and Gpus, for years now perfectly fine.\n\nObviously it's not for everyone.",
      "I didn't say it took a few seconds to reach peak temp. I said you'll reach at least 80% of peak temp in a few seconds during load. For me it takes literally about 5 seconds to reach 85c on my CPU, it maxes out at 88C no matter how long I push it. It does however downclock about 100MHz after a while and stays that clock forever. But I have a weak cooler with exceptional fans, but they're loud as hell. With a larger cooler and weaker fans it'd take a bit longer to reach peak temperatures. The hotter the cooler/CPU gets the faster it'll disperse heat.\n\nNow I mainly reach 90% of my max temp in seconds due to PBO and a small cooler. But even using an I3 with a Noctua DH-15 will definitely net you 80% of peak temp after 30~ seconds stressing it.",

      "Fun Fact - Sony uses liquid metal on the PS5.",

      "There are lots of guides on LM - never use it with aluminum, nickel plated is best but it can work with copper as well in my experience with Thermal Grizzly Condactounaut. As it is not as reactive as some other brands.\n\nFor ex. - I've had it on a Noctua nh-d14 for 1.5years with the same exact temps. (on a Ryzen 2600)\n\nJust apply the correct amount properly. You can also install a small barrier of foam etc. around the cpu if you are paranoid of it leaking out. I never have and it has never 'leaked' for me anywhere.\n\n\nThe least reactive and most stable is Thermal Grizzly Condactonout.\n\n\nThat is all I've been using for last 5 years on all my cpu/gpus. 10/10 would recommend.",
      "I've got that card and 2k RPM doesn't sound bad at all, even considering you can only achieve that kind of fan speed with an overclock. Nice and quiet.",
      "Liquid metal can short circuit components, handle with care.",
      "Probably not. Runs cool enough already. I figured maybe lower temps would cause it to automatically boost higher, but not too a consistently measurable amount from what I can tell.",
      "My friend. The fucking graphs.",
      "It takes a bit of a while to actually hit peak temperatures. Usually takes my gpu and cpu about 20-30 minutes to hit an actual max temperature that's stabilized.\n\nThe first 5 minutes of your benchmarks mean jack shit because the cpu is still cold and going up in temps. It's kind of like putting a glass of cold water with ice in a room that's hot, obviously isn't gonna change much in a couple minutes.",
      "Same thing happens with my 5600x under Dark Rock 4. It hits peak temp ussualy 10sec after starting a MT test and holds that for a long time. It is called temp equilibrium, it's normal behavior. For some ppl it takes much longer because it all depends on what kind of cooler you have and how much air does your case push...\n\nAnyway, i do not recommend using liquid metal unless you (anyone) really knows what you are doing. LM can react with the aluminum in the cooler and you can easily end up with a dead Gpu... IMO, it is better/safer to use a high quality thermal paste like Thermal Grizzly..."

The second they got to within spitting distance of Nvidia's performance (a charitable assessment of their performance) they abandoned competitive pricing.\n\nAnyone who doesn't need a workstation computer or who isn't rich should forget PC gaming imho.

So now we have cards like this one, the 6700xt, 3070ti, (and to a lesser degree) 3060 with terrible MSRP.\n\nThese are going to go for above $500 anyway. MSRP just decides how much of that goes to the manufacturer.",

I even think the PCIE x8 lanes were a last minute decision to save costs just because they can nowadays.\n\nOf course, with demand outstripping supply and shipping costs and raw materials costs being what they are, if this is actually available at MSRP, it will be the best deal of the year.",

      "Depending on the benchmark/metric the 6500xt is 3-3.8x the performance of the Vega 8 on the Ryzen 5000 APUs or the GT 1030 DDR5.\n\nThe 6400 has the same memory bandwidth but 3/4 the CU's and a 15% lower clock.  **At worst it would still be** ~~2.25-2.9x~~ **1.9x-2.45x the performance of the 5000 iGPUs/GT 1030.**\n\nThe 6500xt is about 2.1x the performance of the 1050ti.  So the 6400 would be at worst ~~1.5x~~1.3x the 1050ti.\n\nConsidering people have been buying 1030's and 1050's for ridiculous prices (seen $130-$150 for the 1030), the 6400 (at an expected $150) isn't a terrible proposition.\n\nCould it be cheaper?  Sure.  Will it?  In time.  Is it a good GPU for playing newer AAA games? Oh hell no.  But it does quite well with a lot of games at 1080p and med to low settings.  Several times better than an iGPU for sure.\n\nEdit: the 6400 does have a 15% slower clock speed so adjust the numbers above accordingly.  So the 6400 becomes 1.9x to 2.45x  the performance of the Vega 8/GT1030.\n\nIt's still an upgrade for those on an iGPU for those that want to play older games or games with modest GPU requirements.\n\nEdit2: Best visualized with this relative GPU performance chart.

And here I can get it new for just a little cheaper than a 1650. Not a great deal, but everything else (new) looks like a worse deal. So it's actually kind of an ok card imo. In this shitty climate at least, if things get better, it's also gonna fall in price.\n\nI'd guess a 6400 would be somewhere around a 1050/1050ti.

      "Man I love this, I wish MXM was more accessible",
      "Got my hands on an MXM form factor RX 6600 and tore it down yesterday.\n\nWhat a lovely compact design using Micron GDDR6 (4x 16Gb modules), OnSemi power stages/voltage controllers, and high quality capacitors. Notes:\n\n- There are two NCP81022 4+1 voltage controllers with 10 phases in total (7 for VCore and 3 for GDDR6/SoC?)\n- Each phase is handled by an integrated OnSemi 55A power stage\n- VBios is set to 75W TDP, but I was able to push it past 130W with MorePowerTool and survive Furmark stress indefinitely. With the tiny heatsink, it matches my Desktop RX 6600 performance which has a 3X larger heatsink and two fans.\n- Curiously, there is no fan header on the board. Instead, the fan plugs into a host controller board on the other side of the MXM interface.\n- Manufacturer is Hightech (HIS)\n\nSo MXM is not dead yet....",

      "Nah, the government and some workstations still take this standard. Companies like Dell/Alienware used them up until 2014, clevo I believe still use a modified version of it that can be supplied their own power.\n\nPNY still designs GPUs for this form factor! It’s rare but you can find RTX 2060s and RTX 3000/4000/5000.\n\nI’m looking to get a GTX 1070 MXM in the next couple of months for my Alienware 17. Such a cool concept; too bad people want thin and light BGA crap",

    "selftext": "So I had the reference 5700 XT since launch for about 18 months. It served me ok, but the card would get so hot / loud (even tried an aftermark cooler) that I had to use it at about 90% of its clocks with some undervolting. Also had issues with HDMI audio that never got fixed (hw issue apparently). So while satisfied, I was eager to upgrade to RDNA2.\n\nThen the 6800 launched here in NZ for a reasonable price, I was even able to get it on \"special\". Powercolor Fighter, boy, this is the best GPU I've ever had. No RGB BS, ultra quiet, such a performer. With some undervolting (as my HTPC case isn't great), card used about 160-180W and you couldn't hear it. The \"useless\" 16GB of memory have seen up to 15GB used!!! when playing at 4k plus AA. Seriously, highly recommend.\n\nNow, I haven't been playing for months and such amazing card being idle was a discomfort to me. Decided to see for how much they were going - miners and all - and was surprised with what I saw. Long story short, sold it for \\~25% more than what I paid 7 months ago.\n\nOf course I had checked what was available - plenty of 6600 XT here for the same price 5700 XT were sold 2 years ago - so I grabbed one right away. XFX Speedster QUIK 308, screw RGB.\n\nComparison with 6800\n\n\\> testing here at 1080/1440p and it has between 65 and 75% of the 6800's performance, while costing 53% of that 6800's sale price. I'm happy. Noise wise, with overclocking and no undervolting (2750@1150mv and 2200+fast timings), it's maybe a notch above the awesome 6800 Fighter, but still a great and quiet card.\n\nComparison with 5700XT\n\nAs stated above, due to case constraints, the 6600XT is about 20-25% faster and MUCH quieter. The HDMI audio issue was fixed in the 6000 gen so there's that too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor overall desktop use and Youtube/Media Player Classic, this card is amazing. Fans always idle, uses so little power to play even 4k videos, just perfect.\n\nVery happy with my awesome HTPC card + single player gaming here and there.\n\n\\>>> Is it worth the upgrade from a 5700XT?\n\nYes, as 5700XT are going for crazy prices (mining) you may get a 6600XT for $0 or even make a profit",
    "comments": [
      "I've had my RX 5700 XT since November 2019, and despite some driver issues early on, it's worked pretty much perfectly for me. I admit I don't game a lot anymore though. I'm afraid to sell it in case I can't find anything to replace it with.",
      "I thought it is going to be something negative since most people post about problems.",
      "I've never felt such a strong connection to a card before. From 6200 OC, to 9800GT, to GTX 460, RX380, RX480, (5700XT here) and with the 3070 now. 5700XT was such a good card for the price. Definitely felt bad letting it go for ~$950 after my buddy snagged an extra 3070.",
      "Great to hear your experience with those 3 cards!",
      "nah it has been great on me, nothing to complain :)  \n\"oh but it's soooo expensive\", well, here in NZ a high end 6600 XT is going for \\~70 USD less than an entry level 3060 non TI",
      "hell you can get a 6700 xt with how much 5700 xts are selling for. That's what I did",
      "Considering it was twice as expensive as 480 and twice as fast, I wouldn't consider it a good card for the price, it only looked good compared to the equally overpriced Turing.",
      "What is the HDMI audio issue you are referring to?",
      "So true. The 6700XT is a \"mediocre\" card according to everyone, but I fucking love mine. It's a beast for 1080p 165hz and does everything I need it to.",
      "Upgrades for free are the best upgrades",
      "I think we live in a buy now think later market. Of course unless you’re buying something from zotac that is borderline scalper prices",
      "This is awesome.",
      "There was nothing to be impressed about when you had twice the performance for twice the money 3 years after 480.\n\nWhen I upgraded my 270X to 580, I got double the performance for almost the same money - but well, I guess those days are over, especially since people are pleased with anything right now.\n\nOh, and we're discussing about periods where GPUs **weren't** money printers, now it's a different story altogether + COVID, inflation and all that.",
      "since when a \"3070 with 12GB of memory\" is mediocre? these people",
      "In NZ they are just that much cheaper, and I'm also a long date AMD fan. I had heard that other 5000 series models (5500,5600,5700 nonXT) didn't have the issue so I was confident on the 6000 series.",
      "Yeah, I have a 5700 and haven't noticed any issues with HDMI audio on the rare occasions I use it.",
      "5700XT has some audio drops through HDMI, like a second long drop every few minutes. Not sure if it's only triggered with some specifics devices (Sony and Yamaha here), but if you research you'll see a lot of people talking about this particular issue. Fixed on 6000 gen (5700 non xt was ok I think)",
      "Really depends on what 5700XT you have tho, I own gigabyte 5700xt aorus and not only it is super quiet and with low temps, but it also basically run 2020MHz 24/7\n\nNot to say 6600xt is not great if you can swap for free (not possible where I live and most place's), but it’s not that simple conclusion and also depends on what exactly are the two cards in question. Mine is basically a lot faster vs reference that was a lot faster vs how you ran yours + no issues like hdmi audio and 4 years warranty - won’t swap it for just any 6600xt and ofc - I will not swap it for 6600xt at all as this will be not any upgrade performance wise (potentially it will be overall a downgrade). Would swap for 6800xt or up, but I am planning to wait for the next gen.",
      "May I ask why did you decide to stick with AMD GPU despite the issues you had with the 5700xt ?\n\nIn the end it paid off, but still out of curiosity.",
      "Do you have a link to these issues being actually acknowledged or documented?\n\n\nI had ZERO issues with my reference card while using HDMI audio to a Denon receiver also a Sharp TV."

What's that all about?",
      "Don't think people buying this kind of performance are often above 1080p, and the 1080 Ti is still quite powerful to his day (was a match for the 5700XT/RTX 2070, which aren't any slower than the 6600XT). It's probably losing steam in DX12 games but still, it's no slouch. ?ot sure why one would buy one at this price though",
      "Actually above 1080p is where the 1080ti claws back some ground. It's kinda hard to find good comparisons since the 1080ti is pretty old now, but Hardware Unboxed did a revisit a few months ago comparing it to a 3060 and 5700xt. \n\nWhen compared to the 3060 the 1080ti was 3% faster at 1080p but 5% faster at 1440p. When compared to the 5700xt the 1080ti was 3% slower at 1080p but equal at 1440p.\n\nI would imagine the same would hold true when compared to a 6600xt, probably due to the 6600xt's anemic memory setup.\n\nI think the 1080ti's memory config is really helping it's longevity. The 1080ti has 11GB GDDR5X on a 352bit bus which is good for 484.4 GB/s. Meanwhile the 6600xt is 8GB GDDR6 on a 128bit bus, good for only 256GB/s",
      "Agreed, my 1080ti is still going strong at 3440x1440 hoping to upgrade eventually with 7000 series assuming prices are reasonable, but not actually in any hurry to upgrade as I can still run most games on medium/high at 100+ fps (except bf2042 lol). On most older games (which is what I normally play, games like BFV, BF1, Destiny 2, Dayz) you can max out all settings and still easily hit 144+",
      "Which is bizarre because those cards are going to require some maintenance and are seriously showing their age at resolutions above 1080p",
      "Heh, even in games like Star Citizen, the 1080Ti is still a champ. The only exception being when you turn cloud settings to... Well, \"on\". \n\nOther than that, you only need a Schwarzenegger-CPU, then you're fine (I'm drooling over the 5800X3D, heh). \n\nWell, and preferably more than 16GB of RAM. \n\nWell, and you definitely need to have the game on an SSD. \n\nWell, and the page file of your OS on an SSD too. \n\nAnd THEN you're fine... Well, as fine as anyone can be.\n\nSo yeah, I'm glad plenty of games exist that are being continually optimized for older GPUs :) \n\n(In a sense, that's true for Star Citizen as well, as they basically based their performance target around the 1060 6GB card. Pre-cloud tech, anyway.)",
      "Not yet, but surely in my list, along with Pillar of Eternity and Trine series. Hopefully I can play these games at 144 fps with APU in the future."

Meanwhile, anything arbitrary we as consumers can say such as \"90C is safe\" or \"80C is too high\" (and I've heard both of those in the same thread before) come from nothing more scientific than our own personal *comfort levels* with various temps. Much of that is based on historical conventions that don't apply anymore (after all, at one point a 50C CPU was considered hot).\n\nIt's just like the old R9-290X debacle, where AMD officially stated they were designed to be run at 95C, and everyone freaked out because they were convinced that 95C would kill it in a matter of weeks. Lo and behold, I have an R9-290 that's been run on the stock cooler at 95C under full load still alive and kicking today, 8 years later.\n\nI won't say no to cooler temps when they're available.

At 31% higher price vs. 6700 XT STRIX, the MSI RX 6800 has 55% more silicon, 50% more VRAM, 33% more memory bandwidth, and 50% more CUs plus decent 4K gaming.\n\nThis whole situation looks like AMD wants people to buy RX 6900 XT. It's been rumored that AMD want to sell as much high-end stuff as possible and push aside the entry to mid-range market. AMD's first card to come back in stock were the RX 6900 XTs and followed by RX 6700 XTs (also $1700-$2000 price tag means low sustained demand). RX 6800/6800 XTs are coming back last because AMD's solid yields at TSMC mean that most Navi 21 dies can be 6900 XTs, so why disable CUs for lower margin RX 6800 series GPUs? At the end of the day, value and price-to-performance are no longer AMD's intention or goal. In contrast, NVIDIA's RTX 3060 and 3060Ti cards are this generation's price-to-performance leaders when in-stock.",
      "What a piece of crap, the 3060 have the same price/performance while having a lot of extra goodies like 4GB more vram, better rtx performance & support, DLSS, more memory bandwith to handle 1440p gaming without relying on cripplingly small cache.",
      "The biggest joke outside of the terrible \"MSRP\" is that it's AIBs only. So while before, a lucky few are able to get cards at MSRP from AMD's website, for this one... Not a chance. Least Nvidia still sells a 3060 Ti at MSRP on bestbuy when available which is a better buy even under normal circumstances.",
      "A worse 5700xt for more money, this is literal regression.",
      "Regardless of the current market prices, this MSRP is a joke."

I checked the airflow by dangling a piece of flimsy paper behind the exhaust fan to see it was blowing out the air instead, and it was blowing it out. \n\nOf course as the system fan came with the cabinet, it is not the best.

    "selftext": "Let me get this started by saying I dont like the MSRP either. You're basically getting a 5700 XT for 5700 XT prices. This is not generation to generation progress.\n\nBut... In the current market we're in, MSRP is almost meaningless. All the negative reviews and comments from everyone on launch for the 6600 XT seemed to have forgotten that the 3060 and 3060 Ti are virtually impossible to get for MSRP. The 3060 founders doesnt exist and I have yet to see **anyone** get one for its MSRP price. I have seen the occasional 3060 Ti for below 500, but they're extremely rare.\n\nAt the end of the day, it wouldnt have mattered if AMD set the MSRP at $379 or $250, the price is dictated by the supply and demand. What we have here is a realistic MSRP which matches the current market.\n\nBy the looks of it (at least here in the UK, the sapphire pulse has been sitting at £375 **in stock** all day at overclockers) the 6600 XT has immense supply. Many retailers have received more 6600 XT's than **all** Nvidia cards put together over the last week.\n\nEveryone was saying the 6600 XT is the end of the budget card. But I would argue otherwise. The 6600 XT has been by far the easiest card to buy at near its \"MSRP\". To the point where it will start pushing down RTX 3060 prices. Even if the 6600 XT only matched the 3060's performance, the fact that almost everywhere it can be found for $100-200 less is definitely taking away some of demand from the 3060.\n\nRight now, we simply need prices to drop. Not crazy low MSRP's that wont be achieved. And the 6600 XT is the card doing that.\n\nSure, lets say 6 months from now the 3060 and 3060 Ti can easily be had for MSRP, yes the 6600 XT is bad value. But who honestly thinks it wont drop in price? Remember what happened with Vega? A $400 Vega 56 and $500 Vega 64 were going for as low as $250 and $300 respectively, just over a year after release. I would not be surprised if we see this happen. Heck, I managed to pick up a Vega 64 Nitro+ brand new from scan for £250 in 2019.\n\nThe reason as to why the 5700 XT never dropped in price was because it was so competitive to start with. It punched in the same performance tier as the 2070 Super, a card which cost more than $100 more. The 5700 XT had no reason to be cheaper.\n\nTLDR: The 6600 XT is *currently* our saviour. Not the enemy.",

      "Thank you for the constructive take. Comparing by MSRP is simply missing the point, it's the actual prices that one is paying that matters.\n\nIt's a similar concept to buying a property, which has a government assessed value that is often different from the real market value. You won't see people basing their purchases on the government assessed value either, as that isn't the amount they will be paying.",

This card makes building a PC feasible now.",
      "I know it's hard to get into the minds of people who don't live in the world of trust funds and the bank of mummy and daddy, but some people don't build new systems every time they buy a new GPU. I'm just replacing an old, dead graphics card and looking to get something I'd want to use, and that won't fall badly behind because of a stupid limitation.\n\nAnd using that logic even high end GPUs are gimped because they could always carry more memory, have bigger dies ETC but that isn't the point here. I don't expect them to perform the same as top end cards but design decisions that reduce performance to save a couple of bucks on substrate to me are not a necessary compromise, that's just AMD being cheap.",
      ">By the looks of it (at least here in the UK, the sapphire pulse has been sitting at £375 in stock all day at overclockers) the 6600 XT has immense supply.\n\nAlternatively, they don't have immense supply and there isn't much demand. We have seen that people are more willing to pay up for green cards than red cards, and people are more willing to pay up for top end cards than low end cards.\n\n>Right now, we simply need prices to drop. Not crazy low MSRP's that wont be achieved. And the 6600 XT is the card doing that.\n\nYup. Any card AMD is willing to produce in volume is great news for the market.\n\n>Sure, lets say 6 months from now the 3060 and 3060 Ti can easily be had for MSRP, yes the 6600 XT is bad value.

I would not be surprised if we see this happen.\n\nIt strikes me that the 6600xt is bad value at MSRP. Of course, if its street price stays close to MSRP, it's far from the worst value on the market. It remains that very few gamers should be buying at market prices, particularly since this card is basically a half-gen card in terms of release cadence.",
      "If you want to argue that it's the least crappily priced card, maybe. But as someone who will be impacted by the decision to cheap out on PCI-E lanes I'll wait for a 3060 I can afford.",
      "Looking at the issue with Doom Eternal tells me the future. It loses 25% performance in 3.0 x8 mode which puts it behind a 3060. With the new consoles carrying 16GB of memory games are only going to get more memory intensive, so I don't expect this card to hold up well, as someone who doesn't upgrade regularly that would be a problem for me.",
      ">At the end of the day, it wouldnt have mattered if AMD set the MSRP at $379 or $250, the price is dictated by the supply and demand. What we have here is a realistic MSRP which matches the current market.\n\nTell me you know how capitalism works without telling me that you know how capitalism works. \n \nPricing is not mathematical, it's social, prices are determined by *perceived* value.

Is it a good value *in the current GPU market?*  Unfortunately, yeah, it is. \n \n>\"You should buy a 3060 or a 3060Ti instead.\" \n \nThat just *isn't* a viable option right now, it probably won't be a viable option for months to come.",

I haven't had a chance to test many of them, but I'd generally expect x670/B650 boards to be faster than something like A620 just because the latter would likely have less PCB levels, and is less likely to use low/med-loss PCB material, among other design choices.\n\nAll of the x670e boards that I have personally tested are DDR7200 stable (mostly 2DPC boards).

Were I buying a 1080p constrained budget card today, RT would be the least of my worries. Looking at the 100 most played games on Steam, it appears it's the least of everyone's worries. Nevertheless, DF continue to choose to use 6 NVIDIA sponsored games, give too much emphasis to RT, ignore that upscaling/reconstruction below 4K is REALLY sub par and more egregious of all, being called EUROgamer, ignore that the 6600XT is the only fucking card you can buy since launch throughout Europe without selling a kidney. Would I advise anyone buying it? Fuck yes, if you need a card and have the money and don't want to pay 150% MSRP, otherwise sit this, the 3060 and 3060ti out, they are absolutely garbage tier value historically, a fact which apparently does not merge well with the very NVIDIA friendly (heavily sponsored) DF editorial direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: this should be, at best, a 200€ card.

If you stick it in a 3.0 slot it’s slower than a 5700XT, so it’s actually less-desirable for the crowd that it should be aimed at (people holding on to their older cards and hardware as long as possible). \n\nPlus you’re paying the same price or more than a 5700XT cost right before the launch of RDNA2. I got my XFX THICC II 5700XT for $336 a couple months before RDNA2 launched for example. I reckon if the market weren’t compromised by crypto and the pandemic that the 6600XT would have been a sub-$300 card, and for under $300 it would have been a great buy. $380 for essentially a more flawed version of a 5700xt though? Years later? Yeah not so sure about that.",

I could have sold it for more because it went in like 2 hours. Probably Could have gotten $860+\n\n$379 is too much for a midrange card, yes, in theory. In practice, these cards will be sold out at $500 as an incredible deal -- because that's almost what a used RX580 costs these days -- and you'll actually be seeing them sold closer to $600+, still being sold out.  I'm 100% going to buy one if I see a $500 price, because I'll get more performance than my 5700 and a few hundred in spending cash as the net result, even if the card isn't worth half of that $500 under normal circumstances. \n\nBoth Nvidia and AMD are selling every single card they make, and they're selling them way cheaper than their actual market value. \n\nBecause, again, $379 is way, way below market value for an 6600XT right now. \n\nHow are AMD or Nvidia greedy fucks for selling below market value? And why would it matter in the first place if the MSRP price is fake bullshit in the first place? \n\nI understand the people who are worried that this is the new normal, but those people are complete idiots. In a competitive market, prices aren't dictated by tradition or expectations. They are dictated by how much it costs to bring something to market (i.e. the margin) and the supply and demand for the thing being made.

Hot spot had nearly 110 Celsius degrees and the card fan noise was similar to the starting airplane. It was working with max RPM all the time (3400) in any games that would make the card warmer than 73 degrees (I read that the issue is related to a faulty temp controller because I was not able to change the fan curve in the MSI Afterburner). So I was told that I will get my money back and now I am looking for a new GPU. My budget is limited and RX 6600 seems to be the best option. My CPU is 12400f, I have a 550W PSU and 16GB of RAM. My MOBO has a PCI 4.0 slot.\n\nAs I mentioned in the title, the last time I used the AMD card was 14 years ago and it was the Radeon HD 4850. I had so many driver issues with it that I just didn't want to have an AMD card in the next years. \n\nNow we have 2022 and I know 2 things:\n1. I don't want another 2060 (I read too many things about how bad the 20xx series is)\n2. I also read many things about how good performance/price you get with the RX 6600.\n\nThe problem is no matter where I go I find lots of people complaining about the AMD drivers. There are users who had no issues at all, there are users who experience some issues for a week or two after releasing new drivers and then they are fine for a month and also there are users who had so many driver issues that they gave up and rebought NVIDIA card.\n\nI mean it happens both ways. All I want is peace. I play a lot. Would you give a shot to RX 6600? I can get the XFX SWFT 210 Speedster with Dead Island code 2 for the price of returned RTX 2060. I saw that it will give me around 10% performance boost on average but all I care about is not looking for another card in the next months after buying this one due to some issues.",

      "Honestly, with how much they've improved, it gives me hope for Intel's graphics drivers too.",
      "I highly recommend using the AMD Driver Cleanup over DDU if you ever do have troubles. DDU still sounds the best to clean your Nvidia drivers out before the AMD driver is installed. Optional driver updates are really optional, but I still pick them up right away if they targeted a new game I'm going to play.",
      "It's funny because I just picked up a second hand rx 580 for my second machine (1060 in my main machine) and I am really impressed by amd's software so far. It tells you the actual gpu power draw! I had to change the default fan curve, put a cap on power draw to limit it to the same 120w max as my 1060, used radeon chill to lock fps to 60 with supposedly reduced latency compared to vsync, got some really good looking sharpening going on too and it's super responsive. \n\nThere's so many features in adrenalin and so much real-time data that you don't get with nvidia\n\nEdit: the power limiter lead to a bluescreen during darktide, and my fan curve adjustment caused an overheat in darktide after 4-5 hours. My own fault for slapping those values in without stress testing it. Default seems to be OK and power draw was near enough 120 under load anyway",
      "Yup, the entire problem with Arc is 100% drivers - and intel knew it would be, i'm pretty sure that is why they only tried to compete midrange on silicon.\n\nthe reason the amd and nvidia driver packages weight half a gig is because there is an entire library of game specific fixes and optimizations (rewritten shaders, etc) in them.\n\nthe arc is also not even running D3D11 or D3D9. They're doing JIT translation of all non-D3D APIS to D3D12.  That is going to take some time for them to mature that code and get it up and good.\n\ni expect by the end of the decade intel gpus might be competing at the top end",
      "The only time you can probably get some errors is when pushing oc too much, Nvidia doesn't even have a built-in feature like in order to play safe, then people tend to blame AMD for \"bad\" drivers for their own mistakes when in reality AMD is giving you a little bit more freedom to play with graphics card settings, oc'ing, fans speed, etc\n\nAdrenalin is a full feature software, easy to use once you understand how to use it.\n\nI've been using Radeon graphics since the R9270X era exclusively, it's been a great journey for me so far, so much that I have never considered buying into Nvidia at this point.",

      "I've still never had a driver issue in 7 years of using Radeon GPUs. \n\nThere were a couple releases where radeon settings was a bit buggy, mainly UI stuff. But always solid performance. \n\nJust stick to the most recent recommended driver and you'll be good.",

      "That works too because of very large chunk of people that have AMD driver issues are people that have switched over from Nvidia and haven't done a clean install or they haven't used ddu",
      "I had a 5700XT before the current 3080FE and never had any issues even during the peak of the black screen driver complaints. It was a Sapphire Nitro+ which was one of the top of the line models which maybe why it was faultless. Also had good quality HDMI cable and EVGA power supply.",
      "And has no warranty. Used cards without warranty are like lottery tickets. There is no point in buying them unless you have 200+ USD to take a risk.",
      "I will just go with a clean installation.",
      "Run the stable driver (not the optional driver) and I doubt you'll find a single instability. Been rock solid",
      "If you are just a gamer, and dont do heavy streaming and content creation, imo AMD has the better drivers by now (simply because of modern looking UI that gives you ton of options you dont have with stoneage nv ui). I joined AMD 1,5 years ago (6800XT) after 17 years NV only and didnt regret it once. More the contrary, i wonder how NV still has this ugly ui and so much less utility in their drivers. The last issue AMD drivers had were their huge DX9/11 overhead. But the pretty much fixed it a couple of months ago.",
      "I don't know who needs to hear this but I was getting pretty regular timeout errors in almost every game I played with my 6900xt.  I tried underclocking it maxing the fans running older driver versions etc.  Turns out it was my RAM the entire time, even though it was on XMP it wanted more voltage.  Every crash seemed like a GPU related crash (adrenaline error or GoW was saying GPU temp errors) but it was RAM in the end.",
      ">Yup, the entire problem with Arc is 100% drivers \n\nOh, the hardware has big issues too.   Awful idle power usage, even in the best case scenario (DX 12 game, higher res) the performance isn't very good for something with that much die are and power usage.\n\nIntel has a long way to go hardware wise as well.",
      "My 6900xt is the first AMD card I've owned since the 290x in 2014. Got it a few months ago.\n\nIn the 4 months I've had it I haven't had any issues. It replaced a 3080."

I don't think I've heard from anyone at GSKILL in like \\~15+ years, so rather doubtful; IIRC their response way back then was not offering review samples due to few kits performing so exceptionally well while granted these days they seem to be much more robust. The other GSKILL units I have were received from AMD in prior review kit bundles.",

Zen 5 might be a little better, but there aren't enough sample to be sure yet. \n\nWith Zen 4, above 6000 MT/s fCLK is more important for real-world performance than the memory frequency - assuming timings are already tuned. \n\nFrom my experience, unless specified otherwise, motherboards will usually drop the uCLK to 2:1 above 6000 MT/s. In most cases, 1:1 should work up to 6600 MT/s, again, if the CPU can handle it. \n\nSo the absolute highest you can go on Zen 4 would 2x32GB 6600 MT/s (\\~CL28, \\~120ns tRFC) 2200 MHz fCLK, 3300 MHz mCLK and uCLK. This configuration should outperform a 8000 MT/s tuned configuration that is running at 2000 MHz uCLK and 4000 MHz mCLK and 2200 fCLK, since the IMC is running slower and also since tREFI cannot be raised above 65635, meaning that higher mCLK values reduce memory performance due to the memory doing refresh cycles more frequently. This is an artificial limitation on the Zen 4 memory controller / UEFI.",

Dunno what the board will output but AIDA64 has that info\n\nand 8000MHz is 2000Fclk (1:4) + 2000UCLK + 4000MCLK",

      "tRFC and tREFI are the most important, IMO. You can have a kit that is stable at 8000 MT/s with CL10, but if set tRFC close to tREFI, the RAM is unusable. More realistically, good kits can push tRFC really low (Hynix A-die is around 120ns, or ~360 cycles at 6000 MT/s, M-die is around 160ns, or ~480 cycles at 6000 MT/s, while most Samsung kits are around 800 cycles at 6000 MT/s. Obviously, cutting the refresh cycle by half is going to improve performance noticably. The rest of the secondary timings are also quite important, you can get some nice performance with them. Tertiary timings are interesting when you have dual rank memory, otherwise most of the timings are not really used. Primary timings are the least impactful, apart from scoring well on memory benchmarks that are doing artifacial, burst-y memory operations. Just imagine how often a real game or app, using 8-20 GBs of memory at a time, will access 8 bytes of memory. As in only 8 bytes. No more. In that case, primary timings are super important, but if you need more memory than 4 Unicode characters, secondary timings are in play already, and there you have tFAW and tRRD (S and L) and tWTR (S and L) timings in play, governing the vast majority of memory operations.",

However more competitive games like CS and such then x3d CPUS  are gonna be a fantastic upgrade.\n\nSo in general gaming 5600x with a 6750xt is a fantastic pairing. I had 5600 with 6750xt and upgraded to 5800x3d. Thats because i wanted more fps in games like CS but also a more future proof CPU. The 5800x3d is really good in gaming that it will last for a while and you can just upgrade the GPU and it will still hang with that. In gaming at least. Other things it might hang back but it is very future proof for gaming. If it wasnt for something like CS2 and me wanting future proofing then a 5600 would still have been good and i would have upgraded GPU instead.\n\nHowever i decided to get CPU and upgrade GPU later as 6750xt is pretty good for now.\n\nAs AMD has extended their AM4 support, I would even suggest that you get a better future proof GPU right now. It will do fine paired with the 5600x, unless you want higher performance in competitive games then obviously go with 6750xt and x3d CPU, in that case 5700x3d is gonna be a great choice as well.\n\nHowever if you play more graphics heavy games and such. Then i would even suggest not upgrading CPU just yet(wait to upgrade CPU). Instead put money to get 7800xt or better as GPU. Save up a bit again and buy a x3d CPU later on. That way you will be even more future proof set.\n\nYou could get a 5700x3d as well save that money and put it into GPU. But 5600x or 57/8x3d both will do great paired with a 6750xt.",

      "Don't worry so much about the memory voltages - just use the rated value, which is probably 1.35v for that kit. DDR6000 will run with SOC @ 1.2V or lower.  You want to run the lowest stable SOC voltage to reduce waste heat and shift more of the socket power budget to the CPU cores.  1.15V is stable on many/most CPU samples with DDR6000. The reason DDR6000 is the \"sweet spot\" is because it is about the fastest speed you can run while keeping UCLK at 1:1 ratio (3000MHz instead of 1500MHz in this case).  Good luck, take care!",

SOC drawing 7 watts at idle and 13 watts under heavy load...\n\nVDDG (both) - 0.85\nVDDSOC -1.07\nVDDIO - 1.35\nVDDMEM/VDDQMEM - 1.43\nVDDP - 0.95\n\nAIDA MEM results - 67500/94000/67500/59.6\n\nZen4 does not require high voltage for 6000C30. The gains from 6000C30 to 6400C30 are almost nil, is less than 1% in synthetics and a 0% gain in almost every game. \n\n6400 is not the way.\n\nYou gain zero on read/copy and about 4000mb/s in write speeds as well as -1ns first word access time going from 6000 to 6400.\n\nThe gains for 7800X3D should target IF instead. Each step of stable IF over 2000 is about 1000mb/s read/copy and -0.5ns first word, up to 2133. Above 2133 you will have latency performance regression whilst still gaining bandwidth, so it's still a gain, but the gain is so small it's not worth pumping any voltage to get.\n\n7800X3D is not limited by IO at 6000C30, it's limited by AMD SMU programing to target 1.08 VDDCPU and 80 watts before pulling core speed back instead of letting the CPU actually boost to 1.15 like it should be. \n\nYou can confirm this yourself, go run OCCT CPU benchmarks or look at the database of results and look at sustained VDDCPU/PPT during high load.

Llano blew that out of the water easily.\n\nProgress! But old systems will usually need something cheap to replace dead cards, or newish ones to reuse existing.",
      "Except for that the 6980HX and its Radeon 680M GPU is a 12 CU APU Product, whereas \"Raphael\" seems to shape up to have a 4 CU Design, that in anything but the top end SKUs seems to be binned to 3 CUs for the vast majority of first wave Desktop APUs for AM5.  \n\nYes we heard rumors about \"Phoenix APUs\" being potentially 24 CU Parts, but nobody yet knows if those are meant for Desktop Sockets, when they will come, or what kind of Tradeoff will be made on their CPU side to make enough spacial and thermal \"room\" to fit them there.",
      "Yep, gonna be interesting in three years.",
      "It's worth pointing out that the RX 6400 is out now while the AM5 APUs are still at least half a year or longer away.\n\nI don't see what's so mind blowing about a future APU outperforming an existing low end card.",
      "There are both Raphael and Phoenix. Raphael is the Zen 4 with just some not-too-fast iGPU, kinda Intel UHD.",
      "All APUs we got on AM4 were repurposed Laptop Chips, in which offering \"powerful graphics\" makes sense for single chip thin & light / cheap designs that are space and power constrained, that were put in Packages that allowed them to run on Desktop Boards, but they all were monolithic designs that sacrificed CPU Performance by taking some space from the CPU portion to fit the GPU parts in.  \n\nFrom what we know so far, the reason \"all AM5 CPUs will be APUs\" is because AMD tries to streamline their lineup, by getting rid of monolithic designs, and making the iGPU part of the IO Die, to still be able to offer multi chiplet chips without wasted duplicated resources.  \n\nthose IO Die iGPUs will not necessarily always be on the same process as the CPU chiplets. AMD is trying to get to the \"good enough for basic tasks\" APUs intel has basically had since 2nd Gen Core.  \n\nYes, they might still do \"more powerful\" APUs, but you can only make integrated graphics so good until you run into space, power and cooling issues, because whatever iGPU you decide on still shares the same contact surface and cooler on top other stuff that fits into the socket does.",
      "The rumours out there, for example this one from a leaker that has atleast in the past been reasonably accurate (Komachi) points to a 4CU 0.5Tflop iGPU for Raphael (Zen 4). https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-7000-raphael-rdna2-igpu-could-offer-a-third-of-steam-decks-graphics-performance\n\nSome APU's probably will have more CU's, if we get designed for mobile APU's to desktop again (like the Cezanne based 5x00G we have now) as we  but at least, but i wouldn't expect the full AM5 lineup to have powerful gpu's for now. There seems to be a good chance that the desktop parts get a Intel like iGPU, and not something more powerful as for example Rembrandt has in mobile (Ryzen 6000).",
      "Even if that rumour will end up being true IIRC those iGPUs are supposed to be very weak and even then that won't suddenly add iGPUs to all of the AM4 CPUs and other CPUs lacking iGPUs.",
      "Construction Wise, with how Chip and Memory are layed out on the PCB, and how much space and attachment points they have for putting a cooling solution onto it, it much more resembles a GPU that happens to contain CPU cores too than the other way round.  \n\nThe size you have to work with to fit everything is the CPU socket, the heat transfer is not direct Die cooling but is an IHS, and the amount of power you can push through it is determined by how the motherboard VRM is layed out, all this restricts an APU on a PC motherboard far more than the chip of a console.",

People will tell you that the 6600 XT is mediocre at QWHD, they never\n\nI'm gonna go out and say that i'm satisfied with my 6600XT and I play at 1440p. It's run every thing i've thrown at it well at high settings, Insurgency Sandstorm, Battlefield 2042 (I only played it just so I could benchmark it at 1440p, that game sucks), Forza Horizon 5, CoD, etc. I've seen benchmarks of it at 1440p from other people and it did fine. Now the obvious exception is Cyberpunk but that game doesn't run very good on anything, and i'm fine with lowering to medium (which I think gives the 6600XT around 65FPS from what I saw from RandomGamingInHD's video on the card) and I don't really understand how it's lackluster for 1440p when it can run most stuff just fine even at high.\n\nSome people argue that the 3060 TI is superior in every single way and I do agree. The problem is, that it's just much harder to find one. Didn't find no 3060 TIs at my Microcenter but I found two 6600 XTs for just $540. Looking at eBay I find 3060 TIs at like 850 but i've regularly seen 6600 XT deals on r/buildapcsales.\n\nAlso the 6800 (non-XT) is marketed as a 4K card but it performs about the same at 4K as a 6600 XT would at 1440p which is really confusing as to why AMD says you should just stick to 1080p. If the 6800 is a 4K card then the 6600 XT is a 1440p card IMO.\n\nTLDR: I have a 1440p monitor, and i'm satisfied with my 6600 XT, and I think it gets too much hate.\n\nEdit: Lot of people tell me \"the 6700 XT is the 1440p card. Not 6600 XT\" the problem is, that NVIDIA has not one but two 1440p cards: 3060 TI and 3070 were both marketed for 1440p.\n\nHere's how I would've marketed:\n\n6500 XT: 1080p60 medium\n\n6600: 1080p144\n\n6600 XT: 1080p144/1440p60\n\n6700 XT: 1440p144\n\n6800: 1440p144/4k60\n\n6800 XT+: 4k60",
    "comments": [
      "Just my 2 cents here...\n\nFirst appreciate the feedback. It's interesting to market to gamers especially as it grows more popular. I always felt like \"1440p\" was this grey area where your average gamer might not know what it is and an informed gamer might do their own research beyond the marketing. What really matters to me is connecting to people with their use case. \n\nDo you feel like more people are aware of resolutions outside 1080/HD and 4k?",
      "But isn't the 6700xt marketed for 1440p?  I mean, it says right there on the boxes. https://images.offerup.com/y3PtGNMpbiTrdUH4FC5xmRyMKS0=/888x1920/38d6/38d6140b46994885b969b5f7cf6cc071.jpg",
      "Sure does. There is no silver bullet for marketing and there can be reasons to do or not do something without ruling it out. For instance on a shelf I think it can help quickly demonstrate what product class something is in, so putting it on the box seems pretty useful here! On the internet I think research is a quick search away, so on-the-box features seem less important to me personally.",
      "I just find it dubious how the 5700 XT was marketed as a 1440p card, and the 6600 XT, which performs like a 5700 XT, was marketed as a 1080p card.",
      "On some level I can understand the reason for it being marketed as a 1080p 144hz card, and I also doubt that the average PC gamer will go for 1440p by comparison.\n\nThe thing is that there definitely IS an audience for 1440p and i'm a part of it. The problem I have is how AMD priced this card only 20 dollars lower than the 3060 TI, which is a true 1440p performer and as a result this turned many people off from it. Paying close to 400 dollars for something advertised as a 1080p class card is really not the best look for your it, but once I look past that I could understand why one would want this card for 1440p. It's a big leap from 1080p in quality and many enthusiasts say it's the real sweet spot for gaming, not too taxing like UHD and better quality than FHD. In 5 years time I can see 1080p going the way of 720p today.\n\nHonestly I look at the 6600 XT as the ultimate 1080p card with an asterisk for 1440p next to it.",
      "I think the reason is product segmentation. 6700XT -> 1440p, 6800XT -> 4k, so to not mix up with 6700XT, it seems reasonable to put 6600XT in \"Premium\" 1080p, with 6600 non-XT being \"standard\" 1080p and 6500 series as \"entry\" 1080p. FullHD get bit crowded, but realistically no one uses lower resolution anymore.\n\n6800 non-XT is in similar spot, its neither fully 1440p, nor fully 4K.",
      "It mainly boils down to the memory subsystem of the card.  In order for GPU's to churn out rendered frames, they need to keep the shader registers fed with data to calculate from.  That data comes from the graphics memory on the card.\n\nUntil RDNA2, over the past 6 years or so, there have basically been two choices to keep those shaders fed with data.  \n\nOne is to still use GDDR memory but increase the number of memory channels.  This increases throughput, at the expense of die real estate and power consumption, because you need more memory controllers on the GPU, and more memory chips on the board.  It's actually a compounded problem.  Not only do more memory controllers on the chip take up space that might otherwise be used for more shaders, the extra power consumption of those controllers, as well as the chips on the board, might prevent the GPU from running as fast as it could due to power budget limitations.\n\nThe second is to skip GDDR and use HBM instead.  It uses a lot less power, and is a lot faster, because it has a much wider bus and a much shorter distance between the memory and GPU.  It's also a lot more expensive.\n\nAMD did something pretty innovative with RDNA2, however.  They added a whole lot of cache instead of extra memory controllers.  This greatly increases the effective throughput of the memory, while using less power.  It's not saving any die space (might be losing a bit), because the L3 cache takes up room by itself, but you're getting more performance from using that die area for L3 than more memory controllers.\n\nBut it's not a silver bullet.  How effective cache is depends on how big it is and how much distinct data passes through it.  The amount of data goes up with resolution (more pixels to render, with all the associated memory costs of that).  So as resolution goes up, the cache hit rate for a given amount goes down.  \n\nThe 6800, 6800 XT, and 6900 XT have 128MB of L3 cache, which gives those cards a good hit rate at 3840x2160, and an excellent hit rate at 2560x1440.  Combine that with a 256-bit bus, and the effective memory speed is in HBM territory.  The 6700 XT has 96MB of L3 and a 192-bit bus, which basically shifts the performance adjectives down a resolution tier.\n\nThe 6600 XT drops all the way down to 32MB of L3 with a 128-bit bus.  That means its memory performance is merely good for 1920x1080, and not quite adequate above that.\n\nSo while the card, computationally, is easily capable of handling 2560x1440 most of the time, it's going to spend more time than it should *not* computing anything while waiting on data from memory.\n\nYou can also run games at 3840x2160 with that card, and if they're old enough or graphically light enough, they'll work fine.  Just not as well as they would with a better memory subsystem.\n\nSo AMD was correct to market the card to the resolution it provides the best results in.",

And ultimately a GPU being a luxury product anyways makes the entire purchasing decision a product of \"wants\" rather than \"needs\". \n\n6600XT is only \"bad at 1440p\" if your definition of bad is below 120FPS. \n\nFor reference, this card can be around twice as fast as an RX580.",

So obviously, is not like you put 1440p and then is shit.\n\n>i'm satisfied with my 6600XT and I play at 1440p\n\nNobody say you wouldn't, just that the card is not so strong at 1440p and AMD is putting all their bets on it being capable to do max settings at 1080p, and this is what they want to sell. Perhaps to don't compete against themselves in the \"1440p market\", who knows, you could argue that it is or it isn't a good marketing strategy, just that they never said is 1080p only.",
      "💯\nHere is the thing : it is 1000% a 1440p card. The last year getting back into the PC hobby has shown me how aggressively branded and upsold the PC community is. It's insane what happens in PC communities with people buying these absurdly overspec'd GPU and CPU. A totally killer 1080p card that can easily play modern titles at totally reasonable frame rates in the 2019 GTX 1650 - these days PC marketing treats this like a extinct dinosaur.

      "Mickey I think one of the biggest misses in the PC gaming community as a whole is the value of 1440p/60hz. \n\n1440p60 should be talked about more when demonstrating rich single player story driven games like the Assassins Creed, God of War,  and Horizon Zero Dawn. \n\nThe conversation around these game is almost always driven by 4k because of the television market, but PC users have much more flexibility than the console user. \n\n1440p marketing in general needs an overhaul. It's the best price to performance resolution and AMD could help change some of the mindset around frames per second. Not every game needs to run at 120+ FPS for wonderful experience.",
      "I think they decided to market it rather as 1080p cause you can see clearly scaling issues compared to the nvidia cards 3060/3060ti when u go up in resolution in higher demanding games. But like you for me its perfectly fine at 1440p cause it handles the games i play.\nedit: and that probably was the right move as you can see in the rewiews for this card when it came out. This was its main critic point.",

      "It’s definitely playable on 1440p, but it’s 1440p results aren’t that impressive compared to its Nvidia counterparts. \n\nThe 3060 is very close behind (5%) in 1440p and if on PCIE 3.0, it might end up being slower than the 3060. I know MSRP doesn’t matter much these days but people still do comparison based on MSRP and that wouldn’t seem nice to market as. \n\nNot to mention at 1080p, it’s right in the middle between a 3060 and 3060 ti, which makes it super attractive for 1080p gaming as it can run high refresh rate monitors."

If you have a PCIe 4.0 platform there's no reason to consider a card like the RX 580 4GB unless it's significantly cheaper.",

It will also likely not last as long as a card in a factory new condition.\n\n2. The RX 6500 XT will likely perform better than the RX 580 if only because the RX 5500 XT was already at the performance level of the RX 580. \n\n3. The RX 6500 XT will receive better driver support and it will receive driver support for a lot longer than Polaris cards. AMD dropped support for GCN 1.3 half a year ago and Polaris is next on the chopping block.",
      "I mean... even at $150 or so, it's not the worst option in the world.\n\nThese days you can get a decent enough CPU for around $150. But getting anything that actually plays games reasonably well at that price range is a complete fantasy. The GT 1030 is a fucking *terrible* GPU.\n\nThis thing's not very good, but at least you could get some decent medium/low 1080p gaming out of it for 3 years or so.",
      "not much sense talking MSRP when retails is 2x that on average, even more with some nvidia cards. Also my bet MSRP will be $249 on this one, so expect retail at over $400 if availability is similar to other cards.. And shit won't get any better in 2022, maybe in 2023 if lucky. It's just mining and silicon crisis combined makes GPU market especially totally absurd these days. So you either sit with your Polaris for till 2023 or pay premium scalp and grab the upgrade - that's simple reality we're living in right now. But good luck playing most AAA games with Polaris - Halo Infinite is basically unplayable even at low. Dying Light - don't think 60fps will be achievable. Elden Ring - maybe as game isn't much more visually impressive than Dark Souls 3, tho it's open world so who knows and optimization is always a question mark with Japanese games. So basically Forget AAA 60fps with polaris.\n\nAlso, at least here RX 6600 XT is around 200€ cheaper than base RTX 3060, lol. So it's good card in that sense, actually RX 6600-series is the only \"budget\" option right now at least in most countries at at least can play any AAA game in 1080p.",

There is nothing budget here and it makes perfect sense to include atleast some RTX performance metrics.\n\nEven without DLSS and FSR both can do RTX although Nvidia is obv superior. With FSR and DLSS both are very capable of decent to good RTX performance.",
      "funny thing to say when you have AMD sponsored games like ac:valhalla and far cry 6 on the other side\n\nand since when is RE:Village Nvidia sponsored? That’s an AMD title as well",
      "Considering 3060 and 6600XT is pretty much at price parity in many market, 3060 is probably a safer bet for a GPU that stays relevant somewhat longer.\n\nI wonder when will 12GB VRAM actually start to net some benefit? Or maybe higher bandwidth will become useful first?\n\nBTW am I remembering it wrong...? I swear when 6600XT and 3060 launch my impression is 6600XT is significantly faster in raster only title, and somehow a few months after launch it no longer is the case?",
      "Basically, the regular AMD \"fan\" functions like this:\n\nPlease do not test any game that doesnt run well on amd. Pease remove all of them. Then cherry pick all the titles that are broken on nvidia and run disproportionately fast on amd. \n\nIm an amd fan damn it, don't give me real results, give me the ones that show amd winning",
      "I just checked and the cheapest 3060 here in Germany is 449€, cheapest rx6600xt is 430€, so yeah they are priced about the same.\n\nEdit: cheapest rx 6600xt is 420€",
      "That is not how you calculate the average, there are at least 3 better ways of going about it. As clearly stated in the video, we leave RT enabled when enabled by default which it is in F1 2021 (2022 isn't out yet), Resident Evil Village and Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition.",
      "Completely unbiased person right here lol. \n\nThe thing about RSR and NIS is a lie, both work the same but AMD has a better GUI switch for it. Quality the same as well.\n\nNow tell us how raytracing is useless and dlss is stupid.",
      "8-10%? Did you do the math ? Removing all 3 RT titles (and keeping all amd sponsord titles as well), only amounted for 1.4% \n\nRemoving all 3 RT titles, the 6600xt is 4.4% faster at FHD, 0.6% slower at 1440p.",
      "> Because ofc people buying this tier of GPUs are all about ray tracing.\n\nThe 3060 runs all those games fine with RT enabled. What's the problem? Wait, you are upset because the 6600xt has terrible RT performance so the 3060 shouldn't do it either? lol.",
      "Don't discuss with this guy, no point. \nHe's just upset that his GPU with about the same price isn't able to do the same in raytracing and has less features so he's mentally justyfing his purchase by telling himself that rt performance doesn't matter for this GPU tier and that those features aren't usable.",

I swear when 6600XT and 3060 launch my impression is 6600XT is significantly faster in raster only title, and somehow a few months after launch it no longer is the case?\n\nThese tests have been done with updated drivers. That can change the result quite significantly especially when comparing GPUs that were close in performance to begin with. This is where the \"FineWine\" meme came from as GCN GPUs have gained a lot of performance over time due to improvements on the driver level.",
      "If they are enabled by default then i see no problem, Ray Tracing is the future of graphics and it will only get implemented in future games more often than ever before.",

And the dollar worth the same as 6 years ago, too.\n\nUnless 7nm costs halved since 2019 then Navi23 is about $40 die, and G6 spot price is $10, so a 6600 costs like $100 just for the gpu+mem, so $200 is not a possible \"should\"",
      "We're not including older GPUs in these head to heads but if we did we'd probably show both results. FYI the second highest quality preset in F1 2021 also enables the same level of RT effects by default.",
      "I literally tried WD legion yesterday on my 3060 and on high settings and mid RT it almost never dropped below 60. No DLSS involved.\n\nYou can see in the video the 3060 does 90 fps on Metro Exodus with mid RT. No DLSS involved.\n\nF1 2020 ultra high q with rt also 90 fps, no DLSS.\n\nDLSS at 1080p depends heavily on the title, on some games is completely unusable, like in Warzone or God of War, in others like Cyberpunk or Watch dogs it is unnoticeable."

In shortage conditions, retail eats last.\n\nThat being said, XSX is the best Xbox ever. They are finally building systems that offer a gaming experience I'd actually want.

Of course this is a cut down version, so it wouldn't be the full cost difference, but probably still a good chunk more.  And then it has GDDR6 over GDDR5.  Perhaps if memory prices had actually come down a lot since 2016, it wouldn't be such a big deal, but they sadly haven't.  \n\nI'd be very surprised if this was actually cheaper to make than a 580.",

After the initial batch is sold out (the batch is very small), the prices will go up significantly. For example the 6600XT launched very close to MSRP in Western Europe with seemingly decent stock, but less than a week later all of those subsidized cards were gone and the only ones in stock now are well above MSRP (the 6600XT is over 750 USD in the Benelux and Germany right now). NVIDIA isn't doing any better, the 3060 is around that price as well.",

It is worth remembering that HUB doesn't use SAM, so results with SAM might be more favorable.\n\n330 USD *\"MSR-LOL-P\"*\n\nThis card, its performance and its price, surely is not for everyone, but for RX 580 and 1060 owners, this represents a massive upgrade, about 2X raw performance and DirectX12 Ultimate support.\n\nNow I know the argument: *\"I paid $230 for my 580 4 years ago, I am not paying 400+ bucks for an upgrade for 1080p gaming!\"*. The solution to that is: *\"why not sell your 580 for 400+ bucks, in the second hand market?\"* At least back in August, you would find a buyer in a heartbeat. Not sure how the second hand market is now, but I assume it hasn't changed much. As bad as new GPU prices are nowadays, so are the prices of used GPUs, and anyone looking for an upgrade should use that to their advantage. If done timely, an upgrade like this could cost very little, if anything.\n\nAh, and for the \"no chance in hell the 6600 will land in the stores for less than 2X MSRP\", it actually did. 349 euros in a local store, in stock. I checked again 15 minutes later, it was still there, 20 minutes later, gone. Still, I took a [screenshot as proof](https://ibb.co/1bxTb4q). If you are actually dead interested in buying a GPU, you can't wait a month, you have to pull the trigger the moment it drops.

    "selftext": "I keep seeing people say that the RX 6700XT is just a cheaper RTX 3070, but it's not as simple as that.\n\n1. The RX 6700XT does not have a viable DLSS 2.0 alternative. Some people may argue that DLSS is irrelevant, but I think not. DLSS has come to a point where it is a viable feature to use in order to achieve smoother frames and higher resolutions when your hardware can't do so. For example, I have a 3060 Ti and I use it in Cyberpunk. Without DLSS, I am unable to reach a steady 1080p 60FPS with everything (including RT) on Ultra/Psycho settings. With Fidelity FX still being quite lackluster, AMD needs to launch a DLSS alternative soon.\n2. The RX 6700XT also has a lower memory bandwidth. The RTX 3070 has a 256-bit BUS and the RX 6700XT has a 192-bit BUS. I know this is not important to most people, but it still can be useful to have a higher bandwidth. (Edit: I forgot about the 96MB of Infinity Cache, so don't take this point as seriously.)\n3. The RX 6700XT is expected to have noticeably lower Ray Tracing performance than the RTX 3070. Of course, this is due to AMD being on its first generation of RT cores, while Nvidia is on their second. While not everyone uses RT, it has become more and more popular in games.\n4. The RX 6700XT has an extra 4GB of memory. This will make the 6700XT better in some tasks that require more VRAM, such as higher resolution gaming and workstation tasks.\n\nAm I saying that the RX 6700XT sucks? No. I actually plan on switching back to AMD Radeon and buying a 6700XT or 6800 for SAM and Radeon Software (note: Radeon Software ≠ Drivers), but I will say that the 6700XT is slightly overpriced. With that said, if you manage to find a 6700XT for a reasonable price, you should definitely buy it. I don’t need to explain why.\n\nEdit: As u/Excsekutioner and u/HaloLegend98 said, the absence of a good video encoder like Nvidia's NVEnc is also a point.\n\nEdit 2: I’m not trying to start a war between Nvidia and AMD users or start an argument about whether DLSS, NVEnc, and/or RT is important. Some people use and like DLSS and RT, and some people don’t like DLSS and RT. Some people like AMD cards and some people like Nvidia cards. We should respect each-other’s opinion and not force or criticize people into changing their opinions. I’m just laying out the facts on the 6700XT compared to the 3070 and why’s the 6700XT is not just a $20 cheaper 3070. And again, I’m not an AMD hater, I use or have used both Radeon and Ryzen and had decent experiences. I’m also not a Nvidia or Intel hater, and I have used Intel and Nvidia products before as well and had decent experiences.",

      "You don't really need the \"tensor cores\" or \"ai hardware\" to do DLSS, the inferencing work doesn't need to be matrix based and if anything the reliance on convolutional/DL math is less in DLSS 2.0 than it is in original release DLSS (if any at all). It is clear there was a paradigm shift in how DLSS was being designed and implemented - from being actually Deep Learning network that compares scene elements to a model and determines \"what belongs here\" to a pattern based sharpening effect. \n\nSince DLSS is black box we will never know how much it actually relies on \"tensor cores\", but I would be very surprised if end users are really gaining much benefit, if any at all, from the tensor cores. I would instead postulate it is artificially locked behind tensor-core-having cards.\n\nI do think the original DLSS release did legitimately use matrix networks to do content matching.",

      "My main uses are gaming and debugging, I also use it for study/work and watching multimedia\n\nThe AMD drivers are open-source, on [Mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/) which is a set of community driven implementations for APIs such as OpenGL and Vulkan. You have `radeonsi` which is an implementation of the OpenGL API and `radv` which is an implementation of the Vulkan API. \n\nOther than that, there's the [amdvlk](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK) (note: the actual code is on a different repository) implementation, which is an implementation of Vulkan by AMD and also open-source. It's similar to the implementation of Vulkan they use on Windows, so this is useful to debug driver bugs that occur on the proprietary drivers in Windows but not in radv for example.\n\n**For developers**, these are important so as you can accurately report and fix driver issues quickly. Reporting issues on proprietary drivers is hell, as they may take years to fix even the simplest issues or just never fix them at all. I've reported a few issues on `radv` that I found while debugging RPCS3 (a PS3 emulator project I work on) and they were very helpful and fixed these issues in a very reasonable timeframe.\n\nDebugging is also a pain in the ass on proprietary drivers as you don't have the source code nor symbols (which essentially allow you to see the function's names so you can better understand what that code does when you're debugging instead of only memory addresses). When you hit a driver bug, you have a hard time even trying to work it around on your software, let alone figuring out what's wrong.\n\n**For gaming**, you can get faster and more optimized drivers since they're scrutinized by the community, implementations are discussed on public issues and not decided behind closed doors where you have timelines to meet and may just need to fix things quickly as possible. \n\n**I can give a practical example:** when Cyberpunk 2077 released, it was immediately Playable on Proton (I completed it in 12 December, just 2 days after release, only playing on Linux almost non-stop). \n\nThe catch: **only if you had an AMD card with Mesa drivers**. This is because CP2077 has an engine bug that makes the game crash (seemingly randomly, and that doesn't crash the game on Windows by luck) which was worked around thanks to a Vulkan extension made by Valve called `VK_VALVE_mutable_descriptor_type` (drafted way prior to the game's release, it wasn't created for that issue), and Valve's developers had implemented it on Mesa before the game's release (because CDPR gave Valve developers a review copy of the game prior to launch so they could fix issues on Proton) in order to make the game work.\n\nWhy wasn't this possible on NVIDIA drivers? Because they're closed source. Fast forward two months after the release of CP2077 and that extension is still unimplemented in NVIDIA's drivers, and the only way for you to play the game on Linux without the risk of crashing is with an AMD GPU.\n\nI hope this wasn't too confusing, I tried to keep it simple but maybe I can further explain some things that perhaps weren't explained very well."

These are the questions you should ask yourself, and depending on the answers, look at what fits and what's available in your region.",

There are mixed reviews with eBay but they have tons of protections in place for both buyer and seller. They do take a chunk of the money so expect to not get full asking price. They will also ban/lock your account until you physically contact them to verify yourself. At first I was frustrated with it but it definitely goes the extra mile to ensure people aren't being scammed.",

      "people here can't get cards because of other bots and this kind of things\n\nDR must find a way to avoid that\n\nmaybe an early email subscription with lottery will be better than thousand of millions of people and bots going to [amd.com](https://amd.com) only in those 3 minutes\n\nif things will not change we will never be able to buy upcoming gpu",
      "Yeah definitely.\n\nSounds like his queue is super convenient and hassle free. Plus I think it's brilliant that customers who weren't able to buy a card the week before get increasingly higher priority the next round.",

      "This was always going to happen\n\nPeople have been paying scalped prices for years now, that is why scalpers are still here, they're opportunists, and they've been given this opportunity (They don't do it just because, they want to make money)\n\nAnyone who has bought from a scalper cannot be angry about this, because you helped create this situation in your own small way, And tbh it's your fault if you payed an inflated price because you chose to do it out of impatience \n\nThe actual victims are those who can't afford the inflated prices and cant build a PC now because they've been priced out",
      "EVGA still has their queue and people have been waiting since launch to see their name pop up still",

It’s not for lack of trying, it’s really hard to do without some kind of external reputational signal. For steam, that signal can be your spending history and wallet, AMD doesn’t have that sort of data for you.\n\n(The one thing AMD/NVIDIA have access to that could legitimately be useful is driver telemetry data tied to your account but nobody wants to talk about that.)\n\nBut seriously, things that are not actually good ways to ensure one-per-person:\n\n* emails\n* credit card numbers\n* shipping addresses\n* billing addresses\n* names\n* phone numbers\n* ip addresses\n\nTime and again every baby redditor thinks they’ve solved the scalper problem by “just limiting one per credit card” or “one per billing address” and they don’t realize the sneaker market tried that like 15 years ago and scalpers trivially worked around it and found a solution. This is big business, the people who sell the tools make hundreds of grand per year enabling scalping, they have worked around ideas you haven’t even come up with yet.",

      "Definitely? How did you come to this conclusion because it definitely is not. He just doesn't have to deal with what AMD is dealing with. It does not solve anything: It's first come first serve and thats being botted as well. Of course once you're subscribed to his services you have a very convenient experience but that is not what you need to compare to the AMD queue.\n\nHe only let's about 50 people buy a subscription once every while (allthough he has strongly oversold because of technical issues). Combine that with a high successrate and yes, customers will be satisfied.\n\nIf this wasn't exclusive it would be the same mess AMD is dealing with now. The only thing he is doing is moving the issue from the AMD queue-it queue to the people paying him for a subscripion, he actually started using some \"bot protection\" himself because people (scalpers) want a subscription.",
      "I've been on there since later 2020. The cards I signed up for are discontinued so I guess I'm not in any sort of real queue anymore.",

It's almost certain to use TSMC's 4nm process node.\n\nThere's nothing new or controversial in any of that. \n\nAs to having an APU variant with 6750xt levels of performance I see nothing strange or implausible there. \n\nThe 67050XT is a 17 billion TX chip built with TSMC 7nm and pushing \\~13 TFLOPs with board power \\~250 watts.\n\nThe move from 7nm to 4nm brings an \\~80% boost to transistor density and a decrease in power consumption of around 30% (for same clocks). Plus the architectural improvements between RDNA2 -> RDNA3.5 are quite substantial. \n\nCombine that with the rather hefty efficiency gains from unified memory and I can see it fitting within that power envelope.\n\nSo if this is a lie they've decided to go with a perfectly reasonable one.",

To have a uniform access to the entire addressing space you have to use the same modules for the entire vram. That means for a 192bit bus you have total of 192bit/32bit = 6 modules that can either be 1 or 2GB capacity so 6GB or 12GB total. For 128bit bus that is 4 or 8GB.

Early/Mid Ryzen was such a breath of fresh air.

      "I have a 9070 on the way to replace my 6700XT, pretty stoked.",
      "I'll pass for now, 2 years of waiting - RTX 50-series is a scam and RX 9070 is 750€ at the cheapest. I'm not paying that much for a midrange card - the shit is going too far.",
      "Op has some connections",
      "Lol, I was in a panic for the majority of the day yesterday because I'd heard of people having their orders cancelled from other stores and mine had said \"order confirmed\" since Thursday but it finally shipped yesterday evening and then came early this morning. \n\nFeels good to have it here now safe 😂",
      "Yea I dont think people realize 70 tier cards from AMD are now $600+. Yea these are fine cards but mid range cards going up in price means the 80 and 90 tier will also go up in price.\n\nThis is what normalization is when it appears most people are generally happy with a product and the price just because the alternative has just gotten so shitty.",
      "Don't worry dude, you're lucky getting that even haha.\n\nI was thinking about an XT at first and the site crashed where I was browsing and then when it came back up the prices had changed to £539 for the 9070 (only £10 more than before) but the 9070 XT had gone from £569 to £629 which is way too much and apparently that's going to be the new MSRP. Which imo makes the 9070 the better value card since it gets within 10fps on average of the XT and is £100 less almost.\n\nIt's very close to the XT, only \\~11% difference. \n\nEither way it's a massive upgrade from a 6700 XT, you'll be pleased, trust me.",
      "Yeah as u/xxxxwowxxxx said, it's almost twice as fast in raster but WAAAYYYY better than it in RT.\n\nAfter a bit of testing and playing around it wipes the floor with my friends 4070 in the MH Wilds benchmark with no upscaling/FG and settings maxed out including ray tracing. \n\nHis score was: 11782 - Average 24.76 fps - Playable\n\nMine was: 26480 - Average 78.19 fps - Excellent",
      "Night and day difference mate, which model did you get?",
      "What sort of change are you getting?",
      "Man I wish this sapphire version of 9070 could be available as msrp in my place. Love the inoffensive boxy design like this",
      "That's what I'm planning to do as well.... I currently have a 6750 which is a very nice card. The 9070 will be a very good update...",
      "Take a shot every time someone refers to their GPU as a \"beast\"",
      "I’m pretty sure they said that the 9070 XT is the strongest GPU this time around, only a 9060 is coming",
      "Got the same card. Love it! Lots a head room to tweak also.",
      "Have the exact same setup as you down to the CPU and RAM. I'm honestly kinda shocked at how efficient this 9070 Pulse is. Don't think I've seen it break 55c yet, and it's practically silent.\n\nFor a basic MSRP model (not that I got it for that...) with dual fans that's really impressive. My old Gigabyte 3060 Ti was a higher end triple fan model and it was much louder and hotter.\n\nI'm not much of a tinkerer anymore these days but it makes me wonder what kind of gains could be had with some trivial UV/OC on this model.",
      "Agree. Sapphire 9070 is so clean.",
      "Based. These past GPU prices have been a fucking ripoff. $700 used to be the price for the 80ti tier of Nvidia GPU's. The cream of the crop and now it's mid range? Absolute nonsense.",
      "It'll be somewhere near 90%-100%-ish depending on the game, resolution, and settings they're using.\n\nIf he paid the MSRP then its a real solid jump for a decent price."

The cheapest nvidia card to consistently beat mine is the 4070ti, which would of been at minimum $450-500 more than my 6800xt, and it doesn't win by double not even close. For the record I play in 4k.\n\nI paid a little over $500 for my card new.\n\nNvidia can pound sand with its current price to performance.  In the past their premium was worth it because it really wasnt much more price wise and performance was solid, that is not the case today their prices are ridiculous. \n\nThat said my card has been fantastic, no driver issues, has worked great since Ive owned it and a much better menu system with adrenaline. \n\nNvidia is finally getting around to copying adrenaline after a fair number of people shamed them for how poor their software was in comparison. They used two different very slow and old menu interfaces and rely on third party vendors for OC/undervolting tools.",

If AMD ships the XTXH chip for all 6950 XTs it wouldn't be horrible since the premium Navi 21 cards are already more expensive than this.\n\n6750 XT at $549 is BAD, really really bad. %15 price pump would only be justified by a 15% or more increase in performance, which is highly unlikely by only adding faster memory and high clocks without core count change. At this price, the card is approaching the current 3060 Ti market price, the 6700 XT competitor. NVIDIA's feature set is superior and makes a 6750 XT at the same price look very dumb.\n\n6650 XT at $399 is fine I guess. But again, this increase in price should be justified by a proportional performance gains.\n\nAnd a reminder, these prices as shown in the posters aren't \"MSRP\", but the price of the reference models, which definitely are going to be fewer in quantity than AIB models and certainly cheaper.",

As someone who has a low maintenance custom water cooling loop on my main rig, I hate that I always have to buy cards that I immediately remove the cooler from.  I prefer the reference cards because they are the easiest to find a water block for at a reasonable price. I also avoid the special edition models that already include a waterblock not just because of steep price markup that comes with such limited production run SKUs but the issues with everything from QA to likely hood of any firmware issues being addressed after launch.\n\nLet me buy a reference model without a cooler and knock a few bucks off the MSRP.\n\nI really do prefer my custom water cooling loop because it's lower maintenance than air cooling.  I just occasionally run a vacuum over my case air intakes and am good. Years back I got tired of all the enthusiast water cooling hardware and decided to copy data center water cooling by going to AutoZone for [EPDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPDM_rubber) rubber hoses, [crimp clamps](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616u4IFDAvL._AC_SL1000_.jpg), and [gasoila thread sealant](https://www.jmesales.com/gasoila-soft-set-thread-sealants-w-ptfe) .  I just add 30% pure propylene glycol to filtered water and the coolant level never drops due to zero leaks ever. No water reservoir needed because no loss of coolant. No dye or additives and hoses are EPDM rubber so coolant never becomes fouled. Always use fittings and water blocks that are nickel plated so no chance of galvanic issues. I change the coolant every 3 years when I upgrade my system.",

      "Why, when the 7000 series is supposedly around the corner. With a chip shortage, isn’t it better to concentrate on getting the 7000 series out?",
      "Same chip, better memory ICs, this is not a new product, but a minor refresh.",
      "tl;dr: based on AMD's behaviour over the last 7-ish years of GPU launches, AMD will service lower price points with older cards based on RDNA2. RDNA3 will only be used for premium SKUs for maybe 6-12 months.\n\n---\n\nRDNA3 will probably follow AMD's tried and tested strategy of, when they have fast products which can compete with Intel/Nvidia, only having high-end and upper-mid range products at launch. They thus use last-gen parts to service the lower-end market segments for 6-12 months. Recent examples include:\n\n* Ryzen 3000 desktop (Ryzen 2000 was lower-end))\n* Ryzen 5000 desktop (Ryzen 3000 was lower-end)\n* Ryzen 5000U (Zen 2 based APUs were lower-end, not Zen 3)\n* Ryzen 6000U (Zen 3 based APUs were lower-end, not Zen 3+)\n* Threadripper 3000 (TR 2000 and the 3950X were lower-end)\n* Radeon RX Vega series (RX 500 series was lower-end)\n* Radeon RX 5000 series (this didn't even have a top-end, and Vega and RX 500 filled in the gap until the 5600/5500 series)\n* Radeon RX 6000 series (gaps filled by RX 5000, Vega and RX 500, until the 6600 / 6500 XT launched)\n\nAMD aren't Intel; they have about a quarter of the manufacturing capacity, so aren't in a position to flood the market with SKUs top to bottom. AMD have, in fact, not done a top-to-bottom SKU launch on desktop within a launch window since maybe 2010 for CPUs (Phenom II) and 2015 for GPUs (RX 300 series). Every other launch since has either been top-heavy (e.g. Threadripper 3000) or bottom-heavy with no real flagship that can compete against Intel (e.g. 1800X and 2700X were still far slower than the i7-7700K and i7-8700K in gaming).\n\nExpect AMD's late 2022 GPU product stack to look something like this:\n\n* Titan-class prosumer card: \"Rage Fury RX Turbo\" with 2.5x the performance of the 6950 XT\n* Ultra-enthusiast: \"7990 XT\" - 2.2x the 6950 XT\n* High-end enthusiast: \"7900 XT\" - 2.0x the 6950 XT\n* Enthusiast: \"7900\" - 1.7x the 6950 XT\n* Lower enthusiast: \"7800 XT\" - 1.5x the 6950 XT\n* Upper mid: \"7800\" - 1.2x the 6950 XT\n* Mid-range: no 7700 XT at launch, just a cut-down 6950 XT\n* Lower-mid: no 7600 XT at launch, just the 6750 XT\n\nProblem is, all SKU tiers will move up in price. I'd expect the 6750 XT, for example, to be far more expensive than the 6600 XT despite filling the same relative performance tier.",

Put two of them together thanks to MCM, and you're at 400-450W, for 2x the perf. And finally add the RDNA3 improvements and you get a 2.2x or so monster of a GPU. Really not inconceivable, it's just that years of +5% yearly by intel and +30% every couple years by Nvidia made us believe we had reached some sort of wall. That was never the case, the issue was always the lack of incentive for any of these companies to really push the envelope. Now we have AMD delivering on both CPU and GPU sides and look, intel just dropped one of the biggest performance leap in CPU perf of the past 5 years. Of course that wasn't just because of AMD, these architectures take many years to develop but it's no coincidence such a big perf jump happens when they have to defend their marketshare.\n\nNvidia Lovelace is also rumored to be a giant leap (but not quite to the level of RDNA3 because of the lack of MCM)",

      "> It's funny when here people are saying that RTX 3060 is a better choice than RX 6600 XT / 6650 XT in the same price range\n\nBecause it is? Sort of.\n\n\n\nThe 3060 definitely performs slightly worse, but at the same price i'd still go for the 3060 over the 6600 XT/6650 XT due to having more vram, NVENC, better RT performance, and DLSS**. But the catch is, you cant buy them at the same price right now, checking pcpartpicker and the cheapest 3060 is $70 more than the cheapest 6600 XT.\n\nDLSS**, yes FSR 2.0 is out, and its pretty good, but the caveat is its in one title so far, DLSS is in 100+ titles today, and FSR 2.0 games will work on the 3060. Eventually this feature benefit will erode, but right now its still a feature.\n\nCurrent pricing 6600xt is better, same pricing or MSRP the 3060 is better.\n\nPS. HUB came to the same conclusion in their video on this topic, so its not clearly not just fanboys.",

      "Yes, the 3070 at that price is \"highway robbery\". The AiBs who charge a $200 premium for a 2% overclock and a worse looking design are right to be criticized. And when AMD sets an MSRP that is closer to what those AiBs charge, they should receive the same criticism (EDIT: Because I know people are going to point this out, yes, Nvidia started doing the same thing, and yes, they should be criticized for it too).",
      "I honestly don't understand why people use NVENC or RT performance as an offset against worse general performance. It's just not comparable like that, people who don't care about those things don't have a reason to factor them in, and people who do care about them should be picking Nvidia regardless of some small AMD performance advantages.",

Or else just get a 6700xt, it's an excellent GPU.",
      "It costs the same as regular 6700XT in Australia.\n\nOur prices down here are still inflated.",
      "That's not how this works, that's not how any of this works.\n\n2060 has 336 GB/s to VRAM and PCIe3 16x to RAM ( ~16GB/s ).\n\nIt's much faster as long as you stay in VRAM. The moment each frame must access system RAM to render because it can't store it locally you'll see a major performance drop as the GPU is twiddling its thumbs waiting for data from the slow system RAM.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 with RT enabled comes to mind. See: https://youtu.be/U0Ay8rMdFAg?t=643\n\nHad the 2060 been a 8GB card, you would never see that performance drop because the content in VRAM wouldn't be overflowing to the system RAM.\n\nAnd mind you, that's in 1080p. 2060 is also a 1440p card and there the problem would be even worse.\n\nMore VRAM is always good if you can have it.\n\nIt's the same principle when your system RAM is full and your CPU must access the much slower SSD/HDD storage.",

It's why they increased the Ryzen prices across the board by around $50 originally with Ryzen 5000, it's why they didn't ship lower end models of Ryzen CPUs because they can simply milk their customers to buy a more expensive product and it's why they continue to push out graphics cards with prices of $1000+ now. They actually believe that they're a premium brand that can charge those prices. The days of AMD being the \"cheap alternative\" to NVIDIA and Intel are over. In some ways, Intel and NVIDIA provide better value than AMD in a lot of segments now, think 12400F vs R5 5600 and RTX 3050 vs RX 6500 XT. It wasn't until Intel started shipping 12400F's and 12600KF's in droves that AMD pushed the panic button and released the 5700X and 5600.\n\nI get AMD has been successful under Lisa Su, especially architecturally, but mostly business wise. But they're leaving behind their fans that really have been dedicated to them for eons because of their value-oriented approach in the past. If AMD's not careful, a lot of their old fans might abandon them if they keep pushing prices higher and trying to milk every dollar. The Ryzen 5000 price hike was pretty sickening to me, considering that the node was super mature and the die size only very slightly increased on each product compared to Ryzen 3000. I would have bought a R5 5600X but that $50 hike and the fact they took away box coolers just showed me they were doing bean counting to make profits, rather than willing to give their customers value. And yes, I know, the box cooler sucks for products like the 5800X, but that doesn't matter, it was included in the 3800X, so why was it removed? I think purely for bean counting to take $5 off each product's margin for AMD to increase profits. But I want the box cooler in case, I dunno, my cooler has some problem I have some sort of backup, even if the thing is junk, or perhaps, my new cooler takes a while to come or if I need a bracket for AM4 to come in the mail, I can use the box cooler for a while.

These cards should've launched like last September if they wanted to make a splash, back when NVIDIA was launching the 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti etc. The 3090 Ti was extremely late and is a completely dumb product, hell NVIDIA missed their own announcement window in January about more information because the product was so late.",

I immediately did a double and triple take. I was floored by the image, I couldn't put my finger on it, but the sharpness and color, both in games and Windows made me feel like I had just got a new contact lens prescription and a new monitor at the same time. I didn't even know this was a thing until I hopped on Reddit to take a look.\n\nPurely anecdotal evidence but I came in with no knowledge that the image quality would be different on different brands - but out of the box score a BIG win for AMD.\n\nReviewers make huge deals about the software support like DLSS and Ray Tracing, but the number one job of the Graphics Card is to produce an image - and to see that one brand is clearly superior was shocking to me.

      "Good post!\n\nThis was evident 20 years ago, as well, believe it or not.  It was plain to see even then.  It goes all the way back to when 3dfx introduced FSAA to the industry--no one else had it, including nVidia.   Right after 3dfx imploded, ATi came on the scene from literally nowhere with the darkhorse ArtX acquisition GPU, R300, and the GPU did FSAA & general image quality so much better than nVidia that *of course nVidia criticized it heavily* for a couple of years until it could begin to field competitive FSAA GPUs to compete with R300 and beyond.  Despite nVidia's adamant protestations at the time, FSAA became a staple in the industry and is a checkbox feature today for all 3d GPUs, including nVidia's. \n\n nVidia has always been a company absolutely obsessed with frame-rate benchmarks to the exclusion of the best image quality possible.  Considering the number of people who aren't very demanding about their image quality, that approach has sold a ton of GPUs for nVidia.  But you are right--and you aren't the first to have noticed what is often the stark difference between the competing families of GPUs.\n\nIf you care about your image quality, imo, and it's as important to you as frame rates, or even more important (that's me),  you are going to go with AMD.  DLSS is really sort of amusing to me...;)  I game at 4k with a 5700XT (which I will be keeping until I can land a 6800XT at MSRP, and so that might be a long time to come...;))  Anyway, if I want \"DLSS\" I just drop the res to 1440P, pour on the FSAA to a desirable degree--and I'm there...;)  Frame rates go up appreciably and the image quality is but a tad lower than native 4k.  RayTracing?  It is 100% optional in all of the tiny number of games that support it--and many people don't really understand that when you use ray-traced shadows and/or reflections in a given scene/frame, and even ray-trace a few object surfaces, *maybe as much 95% of everything else* rendered on the screen *is still rasterized*, anyway! For instance--every object in every scene is rasterized--none are fully ray traced.  None.    \n\nI don't have anything against DLSS or D3d ray tracing...but as you say, how many game reviewers ever bother to go that deep into the differences between D3d ray-tracing and the kind of ray-tracing special-effects companies rely on for movie production, in programs like Lightwave, for instance?  I cannot think of a single one who really understands the enormous differences.   The differences are *vast*.  But that's OK--D3d RT is what it is.  What's not OK is the idea that D3d RT'ing is *a lot more* than what  it actually is...;)\n\nSo in the final analysis, all of these perceived differences boil down to marketing hyperbole--but you know, it's all in the eye of the beholder in terms of DLSS and D3d RT'ing.  Shown the same exact frames, one guy will opine on how he has never seen anything quite so beautiful, while another will say, \"Meh!  I prefer to turn those features off, myself.\"  \n\nBut in terms of general IQ--comparing the two GPUs on the same monitor in the same games with the same settings on the same desktop--is about as clear as it gets!  Yep, the win is definitely AMD's.",
      "I had a similar experience switching from a 1080 to a 6900xt, something about the image from the amd card is just better and I can't really put my finger on it, obviously the performance is miles better in my case too but even in low motion scenes like just walking around the city in cyberpunk the amd card just made it look more like the trailer than the actual gameplay I got from the 1080",
      "i can't for the life of me find the damn video.. but there was a diagnostic tool for HDMI output bandwidth that measured what was ACTUALLY being sent from the device to the display. And the reason the test was initially conducted was to determine what the problem was with the cables and the display problems to explain them. Coincidentally the person conducting the test was using set top boxes and got a bit curious about graphics cards. Suffice it to say, they discovered that nvidia's hdmi bitrate being spat out to the displays was lower than what AMD's cards were doing which raised a few questions as well as explained why some of the cables were working fine on nvidia's cards while having issues on amd's. 144hz display requiring more data, but nvidia somehow managing to spit out less data while producing the \"same\" refresh rates at the same resolution while AMD was requiring more and resulting in a bad cable producing blanking/flicker/multiple hand shakes or failing to even produce a signal (black screening even). Replacement of the cable with a better own would resolve AMD's issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGranted it's merely a variable. But there is consistently a difference in colour and clarity between the 2 products and always has been. Since the days of the TNT, and nvidia's introduction of Digital Vibrance to combat their lack of shall we say, colour accuracy, kinda like nvidia was stuck with a \"slightly washed out appearance\" is still today a common statement from people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nColour profiles are irrelevant if nothing was setup to begin with and simply attaching one card to the display and another even at the same time (in the case of a highend tv for example) and swapping between both or doing side by side you can CLEARLY see there is differences even at the desktop level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNvidia often opts to go with a limited range via hdmi, 16-255 rather than amd's default 0-255. Manually changing this in the nvidia control panel can/will help but it still doesn't quite match the output amd delivers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's rather strange to be honest. It's certainly not placebo as you get enough customers in which a swap too or from one or the other gets the common utterances when i call in or they do about the displayed image colour/quality differences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've sold an nvidia user and AMD product and they occasionally report that the display looks richer but they can't put their finger on it, and in the opposite case, i sometimes get a complaint from a user that has bought an nvidia card to replace their amd about the display looking washed out somewhat (to which i point to digital vibrance and while it does help, it doesn't usually look right to them)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile we see posts on even this subreddit from users asking where AMD's \"digital vibrance\" is and i can't help but laugh a bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of texture quality and such, AMD certainly tends to have and historically always has had the lead in that, not to mention other effects, Nvidia's often touted frame rate leads can be traced back to things they've done in the past that were proven to be short cuts or optimizations that have impacted visuals either significantly (easily called out), or rather difficult but once compared fairly obvious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI owned a 3080 before getting a 6800xt.... i tried out DLSS and RT and then had the opertunity to compare it to the 6800xt. Honestly no matter how much calibrating i did on the nvidia card, i could never get quite that pop that AMD's cards consistently deliver out of the box every time. I REFUSE to adjust my displays colours and settings to make a video card spit out an image that's comparible, as calibrating the display for nvidia's cards buggers up the other devices and settings i may already have configured. I only had the card for a week and a bit roughly before i dumped it, as i wanted to see how DLSS mostly did and personally seeing the trash it produced on a 65\" 4k display made it completely irrelevant and grossly overhyped. Maybe DLSS3.0 might fix it's glaring problems but it's most definitely not a selling point for me. I'm perfectly happy with a 6800xt spitting out 90-120FPS @ 4k in most of the games i play (or higher).",
      "Back in the day, early 2000's, reviews used to rate 'image quality' and ATi regularly won out by a healthy margin. Rocking a Nvidia card usually led to more washed-out colors and everything looking a bit drab and not as sharp. Never understood why but perhaps that's still the case? I've never done a back to back but I wouldn't be surprised if it was still the case.\n\nI mean, some people have TN monitors and think their colors and image look great. A LOT of people wouldn't be bothered by a slight lowering in image quality for higher performance",
      "Nvidia compresses colors to make up for sloppy optimization. That's why AMD cards have better IQ.",
      "I'm not sure either, but how things look out of the box is important. Might be worth flipping monitors to see but I suspect the difference is in the cards.",
      "It's because amd applies temporal dithering by default on everything while nvidia does not, on windows (works for linux on nvidia)\n\nThe excuse nvidia uses is \"compression is ok as long as the graphics card run faster\"' or something along these lines.  \n\n\nSearch google for nvidia/amd dithering and the same picture quality difference threads will pop up by dozens."

It has a solvent to keep it liquid at room temp, but you are supposed to let it completely evaporate before mounting the cooler. Ideal thickness is \\~0.3mm, and they recommend 15 hours at room temp. The thicker the application, the longer it takes to evaporate.\n\nI wouldn't recommend the paste version.",

It looks like the 8gb models were released in the fall of 2022, nearly two years after the 12gb models which were released in early 2021. There was also a 6gb model released in 2021 with the fully unlocked GA106 utilizing all 3840 shaders of the GA106, according to techpowerup. I think it’s fair to say, though, at least here in the USA, that the 12gb model on the GA106 with a 192-bit bus and 48 ROP is the most common model, and it’s what most people are going to think of when you refer to the 3060. However, it would behoove the consumer to ensure they are getting either of the 12gb versions."

So with high or ultra, the drop is absolutely massive when there are lots of cars on screen emitting smoke or dirt (like going from 100+ fps to 40) it's a slideshow. With medium there's a big gain and it goes at like 70-80 in those moments.

      "I shouldn't see much difference at 1440p if I use a 11400F instead right?",
      "Depends on the game still. In something like cyberpunk where crowds seem to hit the cpu hard you would.",
      "I am glad I managed to secure a 6900 XT while my 6700 XT was being shipped to me. Upgrading from 1080p @60fps to 1440p  @144hz is insane.\n\nYour previous video on the ultrawide 6800 XT + 5600x helped me a lot to justify the purchase of the 6900 XT.\n\nI just don't get why AMD recommends the 6700 XT for 1440p gaming. Sure for 60fps it is solid but anything above depends on the game and what settings you are comfortable to compromise for more fps.\n\nOverall excellent video.",
      "It depends heavily on the game, in most games it'll be fine but some games are more CPU heavy. 11400f definitely has better value than 5600x imo",
      "If the gpu is at 97-98% the difference will be minimal if any, this ofc if the power limit is removed",
      "Meanwhile there’s those random channels that only shows bar graph and it just looks skeptical",
      "I have a Sapphire Nitro+ 6800XT and it is Awesome for 1440/144. 6800XT runs 1440/144 buttery smooth. Doesn't break a sweat.",
      "This comment should be renamed - user that doesn't know the basic and usually has unstable overclocks and then blames gpu drivers",
      "Hey, i mean, why would you use a lower resolution when this card can play most games at 1440P around 100 fps? I see no sense in there. Also, releasing the OC/UV tutorial in some minutes ;)",
      "Dude I intended to get a 6800 XT but it was impossible to get one for MSRP. I was lucky to grab the 6900 XT slightly above MSRP from a guy who accidentality ordered two. The 6900 XT was a bit overkill for my use case but I will take that over scalper prices",
      "Thanks, i get it. That's why you have timestamps. Live stats are always better for this, charts are for the gpu and cpu comparisons :D",
      "For the price it’s at now a days, yeah",
      "I run a  5800X with the 6700 XT. It's brilliant.",
      "Thanks for the words",
      "Thank you",
      "I agree. I really wanted the Sapphire Nitro+ 6900XT to pair with my 5900X but I have zero regrets or qualms with my 6800XT",

    "selftext": "Hey all.\n\nI'm planning to upgrade from my current laptop (i5-2430M, Radeon HD 6470M, 8gb DDR3-1333) to something faster. Way faster.\n\nI'm torn between these two cards (RX 7700 XT and RX 6750 XT). I have heard something about the RX 7000 series being better for productivity than the RX 6000 series, I don't know if this is true.\n\nThe price difference between these two cards is 63 euro.\n\nI'm planning to use it for Unreal Engine, Unity, Godot and Blender. I don't know much about these programs since I have never used them before.\n\nDoes anyone know how much more the RX 7700 XT is better than the RX 6750 XT for game development and 3d work?",
    "comments": [
      "Between those two I'd say the 7700 XT is the better choice, but you can't go wrong with either. AMD cards will do fine in all of those but Nvidia is just superior in blender thanks to CUDA.  I've done unity dev work on a 6800 XT and it was perfectly fine. \n\nIn all honesty, except for blender your CPU matters more than your GPU with these tasks- Unity will use all the threads you can throw at it when compiling and if choosing the 6750 XT over the 7700XT gives you the budget to go for an 8-core chip instead of a 6-core chip, do it.\n\nThat being said i agree with the other commenter, a used RTX 3080 10GB is the best value in that price range right now. Those that work are well within the valley of the bathtub curve and you'll probably get at least 5 years out of a used one. (Just maybe avoid the zotac trinity model of the 3080 those are cheaper for a reason)",
      "Excuse my ignorance but aren’t nvidia cards better at these tasks?",
      "used 3080",

      "All this info is very helpful, thank you!\n\nBoth options feature a Ryzen 7 7700.",

      "They are said to be, yes.",
      "I don't really know about buying used. It's quite risky.",
      "Might be, yes.\n\nAlthough the best nVIDIA card that fits in my budget (430 euro) is the RTX 3060 12gb, what costs 290 euro here.",
      "Well productivity wise nvidia seems like your best bet. Although I don’t do any of these tasks and only game, so I went with AMD. But for productivity go for nvidia. Where are you from? 430 for a 3060 seems a bit steep imo.",
      "Less than you'd think. the biggest risk is the lack of warranty",
      "Bro Actually sometimes 7900xtx performs similar to 4060ti in Productivity so it will be better to research if AMD support those applications. It's all on your applications.",
      "I'm from the Netherlands btw.\n\nI mean't my max. Budget for a gpu is 430. The 3060 12gb costs 289 at a minimum here.",
      "I'm afraid when the buyer protection of the platform is over, That then for some (random reason) the gpu dies, and I've then lost a lot of money.",
      "Yeah, I'm researching. But it's quite difficult to find a benchmark or anything for Unreal, Unity and Godot.\n\nAtleast I found out that the RX 7700 XT is quite close to the RTX 3060 on blender.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\tMedian score:2147.17\tNumber of benchmarks:411 AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT\tMedian score:2128.77\tNumber of benchmarks:59\n\nSource: [opendata.blender.org](https://opendata.blender.org/)",
      "Thats an idea. Yes, you may need the VRAM. You may want more modern features though. Just a thought.",
      "That doesn't really happen with GPUs a ton UNLESS they've been reflowed. If they've lasted 2 years, they'll probably last another 5 if cared for properly.",
      "I have had a used 3080 for 2 years with no issues. I always buy used cards. No risk and way more performance per dollar.",
      "If possible try the things physically at a Centre near you. Whichever satisfies you buy it... I think this suggestion is sounds good but I don't know if the seller can let you check these things.... Gamers love AMD but Nvidea shifted focus to AI...."

Some games can really suffer from the 8gb not all though. The 7600xt and 3060 12gb are about the same speed, the 3060 has the benefit of dlss. The 7600xt 16gb seems nice but it's not really fast enough to play games in a scenario where you would need it. \n\nTldr: I would get the 6750xt if you can still find it for a good price.",

Tried it at 4k with Space Marine, and managed an average 60 on low and medium settings with quality upscaling. Most other titles are 100+ fps ultra at 1080.\n\nNot telling you to trust my feedback alone, but I debated my options at length during the building process, just check my post history. The 6750 XT smokes the rest of your options if NVIDIA luxuries are not needed. I purchased at $320, and given the market at the time, it was evenly priced with the rest. I don't know how prices have fluctuated, but be aware that the 7700 XT has come down to $350, and if it's within your budget, you should pick that up instead, if the price difference isn't significant.",

With so many different brands of monitors with different specs it's basically luck of the draw.\n\nThis applies to both AMD and Nvidia. RDNA3 does seem to have extra issues with absurd idle power use but RDNA2 does not, at least nothing worse than Nvidia.",

The level will vary on the hardware in the configuration why it can strike just about anyone if they have hardware that wasn't accounted for.\n\nIt's a nice big can of worms.",

It only clicks to 60Hz if you're getting 60FPS in which case you're not gonna notice anyway. \n\nYou should always enable it. It's literally called Adaptive Sync, so you do NOT need smooth 144FPS at all. \n\nIt's V-sync that has certain negative effects.",

A $500 6800XT will serve you well. If that's out of your budget you can try the used market, or the 6700XT, also a GPU that handles 1440P high FPS gaming well.

I seem to have won the jackpot at 50-200Mhz VRAM clock at 7 watts.\n\nIt seems to be total luck of the draw regarding your monitor combinations, for both Nvidia and AMD. RDNA3 does have extra issues but RDNA2 is the same. Nvidia cards can also experience higher idle power consumption depending on the monitors.",
      "Are you saying that memory clock max is a bug?\n\nAlso those fixes aren't universal. In the OP's case it would be enabling freesync. That's when it idles. I had the opposite experience for example, inhzd to disable freesync on all monitor osd's to make it idle"

Dlss advantage is very marginal, *slightly* wider support for now, quality basically the same. At this price point, I'd go for whichever card offered more raster performance for the price. Driver issues are very difficult to quantify either way. The best you can do is look for widely reported issues in games or software that you use a lot; ie that matter to you.",

Even the Unreal 2 demo is flaky with frame rates. I didn’t care about that, I just wanted to take advantage of my ultrawide 1440 monitor. And for non-RT it does a very good job at that.\n\nWhile newer games will drive temperatures higher than the RX 580, older games tend to run cooler in my experience. Plenty of ventilation in your case is still a good idea. \n\nBe sure to enable SAM on your motherboard, it really makes a difference in performance with the 6650 XT. Especially with preventing stutters and drops. \n\nFSR is pretty neat too, it definitely ups your frame rates for more demanding games. Just understand that thick vegetation and stuff like that can really break the upscaler, so if the graphics start looking chunky, that’s the first thing to adjust. \n\nHope that helps!",

The card crashing because it, for example, hit a bad voltage dip while the VRMs shift gears during a game launch, can also cause that if it falls short of completely crashing the system.\n\nHave you attempted to underclock the core and especially VRAM? Also, what PSU are you using? Any problems not caused by the GPU itself being bad will continue to haunt a newer GPU, often worse due to the architectures being more sensitive to electrical antics.",

A few things you may want to investigate:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Does your system support Smart Access Memory (SAM)? It can produce a small gain in specific titles.\n* What resolution is your display? If it's at least 1440p you may be able to use FSR with little visual degradation (in Quality) to get a bit more juice out of your card (or run it more quietly if you're maxxed out in framerate). This goes double for 4k, where the technology really excels, IMO.\n* I've personally found the open source Linux drivers to be quite stable; not sure if there's an open source Windows equivalent.\n* Have fun!",

By undervolting you can cut power usage by a decent amount while keeping the same/better performance. This resets every driver update so make sure you export a profile after you're done tuning and reapply it after you update.",

I turned it on once not expecting too much, and it turned out to just seamlessly let me play while eating less power.\n\nAlso, Adrenalin offers customised settings per game. Depending on what you play, you may want to sometimes activate Chill, other times Boost, and so on. Enjoy!",
      "Out of those options, you should definitely be looking at the 6800xt for a reasonable upgrade over a 2080ti.  I upgraded from a GTX 1080 at the start of this year to a 6800xt and I've been thrilled with the performance.  It's over double the performance of my 1080, and more importantly, should perform well for the next few years.  As far as coil whine goes, it's luck of the draw.  All I can tell you is my own experience.\n\nI bought an XFX 6800xt Merc, and I'm running it on an 860w Platinum PSU.  My card had light coil whine, which got drowned out as soon as any fans started to spin up seriously.  Five months later, and all coil whine is either gone, or so slight that I can't hear it.\n\nI would highly value performance over some coil whine, but it obviously bothers some people more than others.  In \"most\" cases, if cards do have coil whine, it tends to eventually shake out and quiet down, assuming there isn't a power issue of some kind.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla is about the only triple-A game I can find at short notice that doesn't have it.\n\nPeople have been saying it wasn't in many games for a long time, but guess what, we only get a few big game releases a year! It's been in the majority of releases for some time now. In fact, its got to the point where its more likely to be in the game than not.\n\nOn the flip side, AMD FSR is literally just a lanczos upscale with sharpening, you're welcome to check that in the source. Which is why below 4k it performs very poorly. In fact if you compile the dev version of [Magpie](https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie) you can try it and upscale any game you like! Just set to windowed borderless and choose a lower resolution and it will upscale the image using FSR.\n\nThat said, its not exactly all that much better than existing upscaling. I played with it myself but for example in Fortnite it didn't really provide much of an increase in quality over the traditional upscaler.\n\nThreatened? No, wanting to comment when people have massive double standards? Yes.\n\nFSR has its uses, but comparing to DLSS is just not something its in a position to do.",
      "DLSS Almost indistinguishable in blind tests with minimal ghosting in edge cases- 'Complete garbage, looks terrible \\*downvote & harass\\*'\n\nFSR Significantly worse image quality, blurred but overall pleasing image - 'No pixel peeping boys! Wow so good! Just don't zoom in or analyse, most people can't tell the difference! A\\*'\n\nThe sub of double standards.",
      "About the same as DLSS performance mode going by the amount of blurring going on over the whole image, especially the sidewalk, but its very very noticeable. The end result is still usable though. That said, this sub has spent months trying to destroy DLSS even when results were far better than this, so to hold this to the same standards would mean its terrible.\n\nThat said, it does look comparable to DLSS performance mode, which is far faster.",
      "there's a very clear loss of detail without zooming or pixel peeping. I had to look closer, but I can definitely tell the difference.\n\nI made sure to not look at which was FSR/Native when I opened the link and I guessed the one that's native.\n\nLook at the mini map, there's lines missing in the FSR side, that's an easy example to compare.\n\nEdit: look towards the white light, and the black stuff has clear detail loss. You have to look at static sections of the scene. Since the comparison shot isn't the same image, you have to do that.",
      ">A little oversharpened to my eyes\n\nCheck again, the oversharpened is the native one. We got baited since the positions are switched compared to video, FSR is on the left while Native is on the right.",
      "Yeah it’s hard to spot differences in a 4k image with 1080p video on my phone…",
      "Better than the comparison image posted here by my reckoning! The base game has ghosting in it to quite a degree because it uses TAA, which is still there with FSR, FSR just runs on top of it.\n\nThat said, using the newer DLSS 2.2 dll file give better results. For the most part though, even gamers nexus hailed it as extremely impressive, and the LTT DLSS blind comparison video showed that most people can't tell the difference either.\n\nLegitimately the ultra quality pre-set looks similar to the DLSS performance pre-set in many cases, especially at 1440p where FSR does far worse.\n\nI'll just have to disagree with you, coming from someone who has a 3060Ti and a 6800XT, of which the 6800XT is sat in its box not being used.",
      "I meant with the open source driver (Radv). Last time I checked CP2077 froze after the menu with the pro driver.",
      "https://github.com/andrewcs0901/Magpie/releases/tag/v0.5.1",
      "Right you are, my bad. Just goes to show how close they are if it comes down to personal preference.",
      "Calm your tits my dude, I actually quite like FSR and am not looking to trash it. One of the images looks overly sharp to my eyes, just turns out it's not the one I expected.\n\nHaving said that, I've played Cyberpunk on a 4K TV from a distance, thought it looked great, and then played it much closer on a UWQHD display and thought it looked crap. The game natively has this amazing ability to look fuzzy in some places (NPC character models seems to suffer with this) whilst overly sharp in others (like ground textures, for some reason)."

Once that cache is built it should be very fast.  If anyone has questions, ask away!",

It does not inspire confidence or development work when AMD's CUDA equivalent still does not run on two year old hardware, and is only barely starting to work for the current gen.  From what I've seen, PyTorch has actually been doing a rather good job of supporting both APIs.  The reason the patch was necessary is all the old ROCm cards had a warp size of 64, whereas these new ones are more like NVIDIA cards with 32.  Overall it's very new and untested.",

While at it they explained how to update the OS version and firmware, managed to bork it while upgrading it and spent a couple of hours restoring it.\n\nI personally never had a Linux experience that was fire and forget, except running live CDs or anything else prepackaged that doesn't need any installation or updates.\n\nStill, that doesn't invalidate what I said before.

What I had to do was manually edit the CMakeLists.txt file in each component of ROCm to only say \"gfx1030\" instead of all of the other ones, as well as replacing the name in the ifdef sections.  However, pytorch would still not work..  I found a pull request titled \"[ROCM] query warp size for host code, do not use C10_WARP_SIZE #67294\" and decided to try it out.

Ended up being completely false.\n\nWhen someone said that 4070 was $750 ($50 below the $800 MSRP of 4070ti).

When the new gen came out the new generation would cost a touch more for the same performance. Typically, they would have lower power and new features to justify costing a bit more. So, a 7600 at $300 probably performs a little bit worse than a 6700XT at raster, and at least about the same ray tracing.\n\nIf that plays out, we should be dealing with a bunch of posts along the lines of \"should I buy a 6700XT for $x or a 7600 $y?\" And, there will be no right answer.",

I figured that MSI would be a reputable brand and most variants perform within 1-2% of each other generally. Definitely an upgrade over my previous GTX 1070 and lets me utilize my 1440p monitor. I think the thing I like the most besides the performance increase of the upgrade is the Software. I had no problems with my 1070 but it felt like a chore every time i had to open up GeForce or control panel compared to opening up Adrenaline which feels more intuitive and user friendly. The price and performance of Intel Arc does interest me but I hear that some older games dont work well and the software still needs development.",
      "Is this at 1440p?",
      "Got the same card. Limited it around 1500 rpm which makes it quieter but you can still hear it. (Thing ships with 100% fanspeed for like 65 degrees? Wtf?)\nTemps tough are quite good.(even with tamed fans)\n\nSadly mine got coil whine but i almost always wear my headset while playing, so its not the end of the world.\n\nPlaying at 1080p 144hz and recently upgraded my rx 5700 non xt to  a 6700xt and my 3600 to 5700x.",
      "Cool beans.",
      "A lot of times corruption comes from memory errors. You could run it at stock settings and see if it still happens.",
      "Thanks. I have installed latest adrenalin driver and turned off GFXOFF using MPT. I haven't noticed any problems yet while using my pc with low gpu usage (its been around 3 hours now). Hopefully its fixed now.",
      "I have mine fot around a month now and im quite happy with it (still the coil whine is a bit annoying)",
      "3700x and 5700x its been fine so far",
      "Power Color Red devil 6700xt, performs very well, and had no problems at all..\n\nNoise is almost silent because i undervolted it..  1105mv with 2600 gpu and 2100 mem? i can't remember.. temps are around 60/65 when i play games.",
      "I just bought a sapphire pulse rx 6700 xt. Playing with D2R 1440p maxed settings about 90-110 fps and 65-70C gpu and 90-100C hot spot temps, depends on the area. Everything fine so far. Stock settings for the card. One more thing its very silent cant hear in closed case and zero coil whine. So its a very good card i think."

      "Prices have gone up the last couple months sadly. I picked up my 7700XT for $350 during the summer. The 6800XT was around there too. Currently though, the 6750XT is solid for that price. A used RTX 3070 would be a good choice as well, just keep in mind it's only 8gb. If you plan on going 1440p in the future, i would skip a 3070",

Under full load, the core never goes past 55c. Memory and hotspot sits closer to 70c. It can get loud under full load, but a 2 fan card would be even louder.",

I'd pay the extra $40 for a significant performance jump.\n\nAs for the motherboard, considering you have the Fractal North and you don't wish to install a micro ATX board, go for the MSI B650 Gaming Plus Wifi for $170.\n\nHowever if we're talking most value for money, that would be the AsRock B650M PG Lightning Wifi (micro-Atx) for $120. It's good enough for a 9800x3d.\n\nPrices seem to be high across the board and many items are out of stock - so these are the decent options I could find.\n\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/JDxq6D",

      "I actually wanted that board but the prices and availability are horrible right now. I was seriously contemplating the microcenter deal with the 7600x, gigabyte b650 auros, and 32 gb of g skill ram for like $450. I already have the case and a PSU.",
      "Any cheaper bundles?\n\nHow much is the 7600x3d bundle?",
      "Thanks for the info!",
      "Sorry I misspoke. They have 7700x (not 7600x) with either the gigabyte gaming x ax b650 ($400) or gigabyte auros elite ax ice b650 ($440). Both come with the same gskill ram. They don't officially list the 7600x3d bundle anymore since it's out of stock but i believe it was around $450\n\nCheaper they have the 7600x or 9600x with asus b650-a prime ax 2 for $300 and $330 respectively. Or you can upgrade and get it with asus b650m tuf gaming for $340 and $370.",
      "The asus prime is a mediocre motherboard, I'd recommend going for the 7600x + B650M Tuf Wifi bundle for $340. I'm hoping the RAM is 6000Mhz and not 5600Mhz.\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/qnKpHW](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/qnKpHW) \\- Similar equivalents are $400 if bought seperately.\n\nIt's not worth paying extra for the 9600x. Spend the $30 on a decent air cooler like the Peerless Assasin or the ID Cooling A620.\n\nThe Gigabyte Gaming X AX is one of the better boards out there and going for a more premium board is not worth it. If you want an ATX board, the 7700X bundle for $400 is pretty decent.\n\nThe $70-$100 price difference between the 7600x and 7700x bundles are significant enough to jump to a higher tier GPU. For example you can get a 7800XT for $480 instead of a 7700XT ($400)."

    "selftext": "Currently have an i5 11400, 32gb ram and a 3060 gpu with a 600watt psu.  I'd prefer to keep total costs around 400.  Mainly play fortnite, halo infinite, COD... just got an Asus tuf vg27aq3a (1440P, 180hz) that I'd like to max out or just be able to play at 1440p and at least 120fps without issues.\n\nGiven this, which should I go with?  Look like prices are $359 for the 6700xt, $429 for the 6800, and $489 for the 6800xt... however I believe for the 6800xt I'd need to spend another $100 on a PSU upgrade no?\n\nSo $359, $429 and $589?  I'm not looking for bleeding edge tech as I have a series x and ps5, just looking to add a good 3rd option for our family where I don't have to fiddle with settings and can just set and forget at good resolution/fps.\n\nUpdate - After some good feedback I've decided to stay put for at least another 2 years with my 3060.  At first I thought it was my GPU causing the issues which started this whole thread.  Apparently the epic games launcher was set to stream the graphical assets in fortnite, which explained why the first game would stutter but subsequent games were smooth.  I went ahead and checked the box to download the 30gb's or so and boom...1440p, epic quality and runs at no less than 90fps.  \n\nSo yea, I'm just going to hold off for at least 2 years.  Thanks!",

      "I would say 6800xt. 6700xt would be best value but would not be a substantial upgrade from 3060. Especially if you want 1440 p at 120fps.",
      "I have been researching similar and I am upgrading from a budget build. I am finding that the 6700xt is the best value for the dollar when on sale. However the 6800's have 16gb ram I think. Benchmarks I saw put the 6800xt about 20% faster than the 6700xt. So you can try to search for a price that justifies that 20% gain or not.",
      "Thanks!  Okay so I'm now between the 6800xt and the 7800xt. Both are the same price.... What should I go with?  And any reco on the PSU?",
      "No, no. Your at 1440 so i think your cpu will be fine for that resolution, not for 1080.\n\nHeres the deal, u want your jump from 3060 to next, to be substantial and u ideally want a gpu that can push 1440 to high refresh in future games too.\n\nThats why Id say 6800 as minimum but the 6800xt is a good deal more performance to last u longer, ive had both actually.  \n\nI would also not be trying so hard to keep a psu.  Ran my 6800xt for two yrs on 700w also.  Were it not for transient spikes, id try it on 600w maybe power limited. But bottom line, psu not that expensive.",
      "7800xt, its a better performing card.",
      "Agreed, 6800 or maybe 6800xt would be the best for longevity. However if you don't want to also spend more for a power supply. My 6700XT keeps me happy at 1440p. I don't expect that to last forever with newer games but I'm not exactly playing the latest titles either. \n\nTbh, you might find more stability with a higher wattage power supply anyway, even the 6700xt,  say 750 atleast. Depends on quality of current unit.",
      "6800xt!",
      "Upgrade to a 6700xt hardly seems worth it, especially at current prices. \n\nThe 7700xt at $421 and 6800 at $409 on Amazon don't seem too bad.\n\nThe 7800xt I'd say is a better deal than the 6800xt. 60w less power and a similar price. I think I've seen $480 or $490 recently.",
      "The 6800XT is, of course, the best option for your immediate and future wants and needs but yeah... I tested mine, 700W suggested, in gf's PC (5600X, 750W PSU and usually a 3070) It did ok but 600W isn't doing it, even with tweaks aso. Fwiw I used the 6800XT (in my PC) with a 5800X and a 1000W PSU that's also fine for a 7900XTX's appetite. If you take the 6800XT/new PSU route I'd suggest at least 850W to cover you for any later upgrades on a similar scale.\n\nAs for perf, my 6800XT was a 3440x1440 card 3 years ago but since then has been written down to 1440p for more recent AAA's approaching the kind of frame rates you're looking at with any real longevity (and short of cutting settings hard as you go on) For the other cards there's somewhat less compromise re the PSU (600W base for both) but more for the performance. All are fine cards at their respective levels though with the 6700XT's 12Gb being the lowest cap I'd use for 1440p and the 16Gb of the others offering some buffer.",
      "How much are you going to sell your 3060 for? Does that change anything? Because as of now I wouldn't upgrade the 3060 to any of these if I was just paying the prices you're saying for them and not getting any of it back.\n\nI see it like this, with that 3060 you should already be able to get 1440/120 in those games with tweaking settings/dlss and the only one you're going to be able to max out and still be at 1440/120 is cod with the 6800/xt which you should upgrade your psu for making it even harder to justify. There aren't really any cards capable of consistently comfortably maxing out games at 1440/120 aside from the 4090. Even the 4070 super which is another $100 more than the 6800xt at least in the US only runs at around 1440/90 using dlss in Fortnite at max settings.\n\nThat PC should already be a good match for the performance level of the PS5/xsx as it generally performs similarly but with the benefits of better rt and dlss.",

      "Oh nice, thanks for the input!  Yea I mean $359 seems pretty good, considering I have a 600watt psu and it's max draw is 230 watts. With my i5 that puts it around 300-400.  Really didn't want to incur an additional cost for that.\n\nYea and like you, I'm coming from a semi-budget build, but also want a good price/value ratio.  Curious what graphics card did you upgrade from?",
      "Ohhh I didn't even consider bottlenecking..... Crap.  So then what about the 6700xt vs 6800 non xt?  Or still a bottleneck?",
      "650 watt  recommended min per AMD.",
      "Any bottle neck issues?",
      "So I just looked it up... Wow!  Yea same price.  So 7800xt seems like the winner.  Any PSU reco for that?",
      "Yeah that's a good point. So I wasnt looking to be fairly aggressive with the 3060 sell it for about 200.  Must used ones seem to be going for 250.  My rationale is I also want to future proof my rig as a have a 14 and 11-year-old, so trying to get something that would run 1440p at 120 for the next 4 to 5 years.  \n\nThat being said, yeah your point remains. I booted up Halo infinite and had no issues whatsoever.  I guess I was a little nervous because fortnite was stuttering which threw me off.  Then after some research I realized I guess it's prone to do that?  Anyway, with 200 back would you still recommend moving forward with the 7800 XT and PSU or no?",
      "And you'd reco that over my 3060?  Worth the upgrade?"

So they set a super high voltage to get the highest yields (working units divided by total units), but by definition it's excessive for most of the units.\n\n\"Undervolting\" is reducing this voltage while keeping the clocks the same. This can actually *increase* performance as the card has more thermal headroom and can thus hit those clocks more, as well as free up thermal headroom for the memory and reduce load on power delivery (further efficiency gains). By reducing heat you also reduce CPU temps so it may boost more aggressively.\n\nAdditionally, the clock targets tend to also be set quite high, and there are steep diminishing returns to having higher clock speeds. So you can also reduce those clock targets which allows you to reduce the voltage further. You may lose a little performance but less than you think.\n\nFor example, by reducing clocks and voltage I was able to cut power consumption by nearly 20% and only lost ~3% performance on a 5700 XT. [See this user](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/dgkfyb/more_undervolting_results_on_a_reference_5700xt/)\n\nEdit: Another thing is that silicon quality *increases* over time, but to my knowledge the stock voltage settings are not changed or set per card.

      "Yes, and rumor has it that the 7xxx series is supposed to be at least $50 dollars more than these MSRP. Simple answer is, don't buy them. I realize that may not be an option for some people but the only way to get the point across that we won't be gouged to death for corporate profits is to not buy the cards.",
      "Sure, but at this stage, AMD is losing marketshare at a rather alarming rate. Intel hasn't even entered the space yet either, AMD should be fighting tooth and nail to keep as much marketshare as they can before Intel enters, because you can bet your bottom dollar, Intel's strategy will be to target the mainstream market which is where AMD is currently succeeding. \n\nIntel will simply outprice AMD and NVIDIA to gain marketshare and then what will AMD have to show for it, AMD's fanbase primarily buys based on value in dGPU, so once Intel provides better value why choose AMD? AMD can't beat NVIDIA in sales in the high end halo market due to NVIDIA's mindshare and they also can't beat them in the midrange sector where NVIDIA will simply out-ship and out-market them. Adding Intel into the mix only puts AMD in a tough position, so they better believe they're gonna have a problem when Intel starts putting out cards at cost price or at a loss just to get marketshare.\n\nThe only saving grace for AMD is that they will be able to match NVIDIA for performance or slightly beat them or slightly lose to them in a particular segment, but that matters very little because AMD's had that advantage for years and still cards like the GTX 1060 out-shipped the RX 480/580 and RX 470/570 combined. AMD for whatever reason can't penetrate the market towards gamers, despite their business being slightly profitable in terms of margins. I think it really has to do with their marketing, it's cringe, Radeon Rebellion is a good example of just cringe marketing. Then you have situations like Vega where they hyped it up only for it to release later than the GTX 1080 by a year and match it in performance. I'm happy those days are a bit behind AMD but they also don't seem to not market very effectively. NVIDIA's name is plastered everywhere in net cafes, at eSports events, they will send parts to streamers to promote stuff, they will even work with Intel on overclocking records etc. AMD does none of that because they're too stubborn or too stupid to. AMD's marketing \"hype\" is to put RDNA2 in Fortnite, which isn't their target market for starters and especially when Fortnite was losing popularity too... It's not even comparable the two types of marketing, NVIDIA is simply better in that area, even if NVIDIA imo is disingenuous, they simply will put their name out there more effectively.",

      "this looks utterly atrocious",
      "The whole point of a refresh is to offer better performances at the same price",
      "Be aware that we've been told by multiple sources that the initial wave of 6650 XT stock has been subsidized by AMD in quite a few regions, so I'd wait a little bit before making any conclusions regarding pricing.\n\nThat said if they are going to continue to keep selling the 6650 XT at the same prices the 6600 XT's were available when why make the price hike official? Not a good look for AMD if that's the case. Ideally at this point you'd want the MSRP to be $20 lower, not higher :D",
      "If you check Newegg there actually isn't a price increase. There's 3 models in stock for 400 right now, which is the same price AIB's were selling the 6600 XT for and also the MSRP of the 6650 XT\n\nWhat I think happened is AMD is stealing the scalper margin from AIB's with this card. The price AMD (and Nvidia) charges AIB's for GPU dies is based on MSRP. However, the 66X0 cards do not have a reference model, so AIB's decide the actual selling price. AIB's were basically buying dies from AMD with the 380 MSRP in mind and then scalping them to 400.\n\nWe saw this before with the 2060. Nvidia reduced the MSRP to 300, but after quickly selling off their remaining FE's, they never restocked them. That means AIB's were free to set the actual selling price so the *actual* cost of a 2060 was 320-340. But AIB's got the dies from Nvidia with the 300 dollar MSRP in mind.\n\nAMD (and Nvidia) likely set the contracts up this way because in a normal market, the selling price for the card would be around their MSRP. Both companies do not have the scale of AIB's to produce PCB's and the other needed components, so they're reliant on them, especially for the cheaper models. Which is why that compromise was historically left in. But obviously AIB's took that little loophole and *ran* with it over the past two years.\n\nSo AMD just set the MSRP at what the actual selling price would be to be more honest and get more from AIB's. So this is actually a net positive for gamers oddly enough because they're now getting a *faster* card for the same price as before.\n\nThe issue is the reviews didn't know that this would happen since they can't see the future so they all come off as negative. Even though this card is actually a net positive for gamers. But imo the price jousting is pretty interesting from a business perspective.",
      "Their mindset has always been the same...the only difference is that now they can get away with more due to the high demand.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that this is a trash refresh that add nothing to the current generation so people have all the right to be pissed off.",
      "It looks like the 6600 XT is getting discontinued but the 6700 XT and 6900 XT will still be around. Good news is that multiple models of the 6650 XT are in stock for MSRP (399) at Newegg so it's actually overall an improvment.\n\nThis card looks like AMD stealing the scalper margin from AIB's without changing the street price for people.",
      "Market share doesn't matter if your margins are still massive. Losing sales/market share isn't always a bad move if you can charge more % wise.",
      "This wouldn't be the product to gain marketshare back though, and certainly not at this stage, perhaps 4/5 months out from the next generaton. \n\nAlso desktop GPUs is one of AMDs lowest priority product categories.",

This is just my opinion but I don't see parity with Nvidia in rasterization as the incredible achievement it's being made out to be here. AMD had a huge opportunity while Nvidia sandbagged in favor or profit using what is essentially a 10nm node and still came up short. They will take a beating next go around.",

The Corsair RM series is a solid, basic, gold-rated PSU.  For an RX 6800, you shouldn't have an issue at all.  For an RX 6800 XT, so long as you didn't go ham with the power limit, and especially if you locked clocks to say, 2500MHz, and undervolted, I don't forsee you having issues.\n\nSpeaking in general, a few good \\*rough\\* feeler gauges of PSU quality are:\n\n\\- Price of the unit, compared to...\n\n\\- The max wattage rating, the max single-rail 12V amperage rating\n\n\\- The length of the warranty.\n\n\\- And the efficiency rating (though this is MUCH less important than the previous two items)\n\nRe: Warranty.  The warranty length is telling you the general quality of the electronics components used within a particular unit.\n\nMy rules of thumb are: A gold-rated PSU with a 5-year warranty is the \\**BARE*\\* minimum I would ever consider, and I would *only* buy it if there were NO other PSU's with a 7+ year warranty available.\n\n7-year warranties are the bog-standard for decent-quality Gold-rated PSU's.

I did not yet beat my TimeSpy scores but those where pretty crazy anyway (16 837 GPU Score). I get almost reference XT performance with OC. Non demanding titles dont even activate the fans.

Otherwise the reference cooler is good enough even for top 100 scores. There is always risk of damaging something. Imagine being me after switching the cooler, trying to boot and get \"AGP Error\" beeps with my old vega (swapped the cooler) and the new 6800.

      "Nice to see that it works! I had a Morpheus II on my 1080 Ti. It was a Inno3D X3 ultra edition, but the cooler was bad. Always had temps at 80c and the card would throttle. With the Morpheus II and two ML120 fans my temps dropped to 52c and clocks were stable at 2050Mhz, while staying silent.\n\nFor the Radeon 6800 series I think the Morpheus 8057 is a better option than the II. The heatsink dimensions on the 8057 are 40x38mm vs 40x32mm on the II. You'll have better coverage on the core with the 8057.",

How things are going we may be looking at throwing the 69XT to bin in a year or two if all new AAA games come out with RT stuff like CB2077 as RDNA2 is currently quite week with RT. If nothing major happens in the software department it is more than likely that RDNA3 will be way more powerful with RT, like double or triple, and at this point the RDNA2 cards are quite literally struggling.\n\nSo bearing this in mind we need to look at the price vs performance vs longevity formula. And if all RDNA2 cards will be scrap when next gen hits, in a year or two, then getting the cheapest option is the wisest decision, unless you are sleeping on piles of money, then of course get the best there is everytime.",

Personally I \"want\" an 6800XT but REALLY cant justify upgrading the 5700XT, its not twice as fast at 1440p and ray-tracing performance are 2070-2080 levels, so logical thing would be to wait a gen.. but hey, who does that \"logical\" thing.",

      "DLSS is fantastic, game changing technology, and I'm a huge fan of it!  But at the same time, if Ray Tracing is going to grow more complex with time (and I imagine it will) then DLSS will have to make similar advances in performance to compensate for the extra processing.  \n  \nNow to be fair DLSS could improve more quickly than Ray Tracing does, and if that's the case then yeah, 2020's RT cards are going to hold out a bit longer.... but when one has to depend on *two* technologies at once to get a playable framerate, that creates potential negative conflicts and consequences.  \n  \nAs of right this moment I'm not convinced that Ray Tracing is more than a gimmick.  In five or ten years it could be the industry standard, but today, in 2021, I just don't think the tech is ready for primetime.  A lot of these games don't present a significant visual improvement over rasterization, but *all* of them have a 20% performance hit.  (I've been reassured repeatedly that my opinion on Ray Tracing is wrong, though, so take what I said with a grain of salt.)  \n  \nDLSS is cool, Ray Tracing will be cool, but if somebody is getting a top of the line RTX GPU in 2021 and expecting it to perform really well in Ray Traced games in 2023, I just think they're going to be disappointed is all.

I'm wondering in these crazy times of graphics cards, if anyone is actually doing waterblocks for these 6800 cards, that can occasionally be purchased, as opposed to the standard reference that have basically never existed in any reasonable numbers (at least here in Australia).\n\nThese cards are faster than the geforce 2080ti and 3070 cards, and can sometimes compete with the 3080, and yet the slower, older 5700xt pulse seem to have plenty of waterblocks available.\n\nI was originally hoping to buy a reference 6800xt, (which would have made the waterblock search easy), but could only find a Pulse 6800 for around the same price. Now 6700XT cards are even more expensive locally than both of their much faster stock siblings, were originally sold for.\n\nIf anyone has found a waterblock for the Sapphire Pulse 6800, would you please let me know?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2846jq14f8q61.jpg?width=706&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f1e32664fc6fd91ba3c587a8a010c2b4c106247",

      "I’m pretty sure Bykski does actually sell a separate block with the A-RX6800-X name, and that it’s not just an illustration of the A-RX6900XT-X block. If you look closely at the photos, they are actually different blocks, so I reckon your seller sent you the wrong product and then tried to claim that it’s all the same thing.\n\nEDIT: Bykski also lists a block by the name of A-SP6800-X for Sapphire 6800 cards, so that one might fit the Pulse if it has a different PCB from reference cards.",
      "I'm still waiting for someone with some inside knowledge.  The pulse 6800 is quite a beast of a card (2500mhz+) and quite energy efficient.  I would love to be able to add it into my custom loop which has plenty of headroom available...",
      "I think I just found the waterblock. The Bykski A-DL6800-X has just been released. It should fit the Sapphire Pulse 6800, Powercolor Fighter 6800, and the Dataland X-serial 6800 model, which all look like they share the same PCB layout.\n\n[BYKSKI A-DL6800-X](https://imgur.com/a/dprkdma)",

      "I can't find any pcb pictures or diagrams of the 6800xt pulse. The pulse 6800 is based on a smaller amd reference board design, also used by powercolor fighter & dataland x series. \n\nThe only thing I can find from techpowerup is the pulse 6800xt has a slightly longer heatsink than the 6800xt nitro. U might need to disassemble it to check if it uses the amd reference or nitro, which should have waterblocks, or another model out there. Make sure you check the vrm clearances for compatibility. The ek site also has some compatibility photos & diagrams which may be useful. \n\nGood luck.",
      "The A-SP6800-X waterblock is for the Nitro 6800. I was told from a Bykski AliExpress store the A-RX6800-X was not actually physically available, it was only listed in online pictures. They provided the A-RX6900XT-X block which will fit all the the standard stock AMD reference parts.\n\nThe Pulse 6800 and Fighter 6800 closely resemble the smaller 6800 AMD reference design that is shown in the diagrams of the A-RX6800-X waterblock\n\n[Smaller Reference RX 6800 PCB - Pulse & Fighter](https://imgur.com/a/e8p8bOT)",

      "Unfortunately, still waiting.  The ali express seller said they would let me know if a compatible block ever became available.  It's a shame amd only produced the 6800 on the larger 6800/6900xt reference design boards and not the smaller reference design pcb sapphire and powercolor utilised. \nIt seems crazy that most of the much slower mid range 5700 series have waterblocks,  but many of the high end 6800 series have nothing available yet...",

The initial A-RX6800-X waterblock design didnt account for the bottom capacitor nearest the pci-e notch that this one seems to overcome with a larger cut out, which I guess its why it was never made.",
      "It fits nicely. U might need to use the included thermal pads along with the grey thermal clay already on the board to properly connect the PCB to the VRM and memory, on the main block and the back plate to ensure you achieve the best results.

I've been trying to get Nvidia's 3070 since it released until I learned of Radeon's new RT 6800 and 6800 XT. \n\nI know that the RTX 3070 is the cheaper option, but the RX6800 is reportedly faster in most aspects. (This will actually be my first GPU so I don't know much about the terms).\n\nSince the latter is coming out tomorrow I'd like to know: \nShould I attempt to buy Radeon's or hope I can nab Nvidia's during another sporadic restock?",

      "There are no benchmarks of amd cards except for the claims of amd.",
      "from my experience it wasn't really playable, I think the game tries to get the missing VRAM from your \"other\", much much much slower ram, and this translates in a ton of spikes.",
      "What resolution are you interested in? Are you interested in ray tracing? If so, from what I've seen, the 3070 actually beats the 6800 XT despite being $150 cheaper in terms of 4K ray tracing. However, if you just care about raw rasterized performance, AMD has more VRAM and is quite good at non-ray tracing fps. The 6800XT is on par with the 3080 in non-4K ray tracing fps, despite having a $50 lower MSRP while also having more VRAM.\n\nI think the 3070 has plenty of VRAM for 1440p, but if you intend to keep it for a long time, then I think it would not be great for 4K. I think the 3080's 10gb is plenty for 4K, but AMD's 6800 and 6800XT have 16gb, which is clearly more. \n\nFinally, not all of these cards are in the same price bracket. However, oversimplified, roughly:\n\n4K, ray-tracing: 3080 \n4K, no ray-tracing: 6800 XT\n1440p, ray-tracing: 3070, 3080 (if you can afford it)\n1440p, no ray-tracing: 6800 XT (if you can afford it), 6800 (budget alternative), 3070 (Not the highest performance, but still a reasonably strong contender given its price)\n\nRather unfortunately, both NVDIA and AMD are having supply issues right now, so purchasing any of these at MSRP is going to be difficult.",
      "idk what led you to believe any or this... the benchmarks show that the 6800xt is either equal or better than the 3080, which itself is significantly better than the 3070. And I have personally tweaked down settings because I was using too much VRAM (8.9Go on mh:world) in 1440p, which means players who play in 4k use much more themselves.",

Please note that, if the wattage requirement of the video card exceeds 90% of your PSU which is 585 watts, you should reduce the power usage of the card to get under the 585 mark, so, that the durability of your power supply is not reduced in the future.\n\nIf you benchmark the video card, the Nvidia RTX 3080 and above and the AMD RX 6800 and above can hit 500 watts during the tests. I'm not sure if you want to risk it, because that will be the moment your computer system might crash.

      "Hey man so I got ex 7800xt and paired with my ryzen 5 5600 its actually really good. I am having crazzy fps on 1080p except in new call of duty and warzone. For some reason my gpu is not at 100% while running extreme settings with native resolution. But overall i am happy with it got it today so will test mode tomorrow but for now i am really happy with the purchase.",
      "Given your current setup and plans, here’s my top choices for performance and value:\n\n1. **RX 6800 XT (Used) f** (Lenovo Legion or Nitro+)\n   *  The RX 6800 XT is a great 1440p GPU, and at 370 EUR, these used options are strong value buys. Both models should give you a substantial performance boost over your RTX 3060, especially in 1440p gaming.\n   *  Used GPUs are a bit riskier, but if these come with a warranty or are from a reputable seller, they can be excellent deals. Just check for clear seller policies on returns or issues.\n2. **RX 7700 XT (New)** \n   *  The RX 7700 XT is newer and generally has better support for modern features like AV1 encoding and lower power consumption. It performs close to the 6800 XT in 1440p and provides a safer, new option without the risk associated with used hardware.\n   *  Performance-wise, the 7700 XT is generally close to the RX 6800 XT but is a bit more expensive than the used 6800 XT options. However, as it’s new, it comes with full warranty support.\n3. **RX 6800 XFX (New)** \n   *  This new option offers a balance of performance and price, without the risk of buying used. It’s a bit below the 6800 XT in raw power but still excellent for 1440p.\n   *  For a similar price, you might get more future-proofing with the RX 7700 XT, though the 6800 XFX is still solid.\n\nThe 7700 XT, being newer, has the advantage of possibly longer driver support. However, for raw 1440p performance, both the RX 6800 XT options will perform similarly.\n\nIf you’re cautious about used GPUs, the new RX 7700 XT or the new RX 6800 might be safer choices. But if you’re comfortable with the used route, the 370 EUR RX 6800 XT options are an incredible value for performance.\n\nIf you’re comfortable with used, go with either the RX 6800 XT Lenovo Legion or Nitro+ at 370 EUR for the best price-to-performance. If you’d rather stick with new hardware, the RX 7700 XT at 444 EUR is a strong choice that will handle 1440p gaming and comes with warranty support.\n\nEither of these will be great at 1440p, especially when paired with your planned Ryzen 5 7600X upgrade.\n\nWell I feel like I have just typed more than I should but I hope you find this helpful. I have tried as much as possible to dig deep into all aspects just to provide a more played out opinion.",
      "They are all the same, more or less. I had the RX6800 16GB for 3 years and the 6800XT for two weeks. Would prefer the RX6800 16GB again and overclock it to 6800XT performance level. The 128MB IF$ is just insainly good for 1440p, although the compute power is on a medium level of ~17 Tflops fp32 for the RX6800. The RX6800 has the best compute/cache ratio of all RDNA2/3 GPUs. 60CU over 128MB, it's 2.13 MB IF$ per CU, the RX6800 swims in bandwidth and is always Compute limited. The IPC per CU is here in greatest form. \nThats the reason why I would go for the RX 6800 for 400€ by now.",

    "selftext": "I built a new system in December 2020. As there was already a problem in getting videocards a bought a 2nd hand 980ti. \n\nNow 2 years later the supply is better, prices are dropping for both used and new cards so it is time to look for an upgrade, especially because I replaced my 51\" HD television for a 4k 55\" (I game on my pc sitting on 180cm distance from the screen) and the 4k resolution  is pushing the 980 to its limits. \n\nInteresting options now are the RTX 3070 8gb for €400  used, or 6800XT 16GB for €475 used in the Netherlands. The 3080 is a lot more expensive. \n\nWhich card is a better choice at the moment, which is a more futureproof choice for the next 4 years?\nMy hesitation of the 3070 is especially the 8gb ram, a relatively small amount for 4k resolution. \n\nAlso, will the prices drop more in the next months/year (new and used)? \n\nThe games I play are mostly 3-5 years old. So in 2026 I play most likely the games released in 2022. \n\nCurrent system: \n\nMainboard: Gigabyte Z490M Gaming X (Z490, socket 1200)\nCPU: Intel Core i5-10400F 2,9GHz (4,3GHz) 6core\nRAM: 2x 8GB PNY XLR8 DDR4 3600MHz\nPSU: MSI MPG A650GF gold rating\nSSD: Crucial 1TB M.2\nGraphics card: Asus Strix GTX 980 TI 6GB",

      "I would choose rx6800 because of the vram",
      "It's also about 25% faster so an easy win for the 6800XT",
      "The 3070 is a 1440p card,  if you want 4k go 6800xt or (preferably) higher",
      "Also don’t forget when going to amd from Nvidia I would run the program ddu to completely remove the nvidia drivers.",
      "For future proofing, I would avoid the Rtx 3070 because it’s vram is only 8GB. I would definitely choose the 6800xt because the 16GB will help in the future.",
      "All right, 6800 XT or higher it is. Hopefully the prices will drop more :)",
      "As a 7900 XT will be eur1200 (MSRP in USD times 1,3), I expect a 7800XT to be around eur1000\n\nThat said, I think eur700 for a 6900XT is a good price, with availability right away instead of waiting another year and the hassle to get one.\n\n(Hopefully I can get one for 700 , as the prices a increasing and dropping each day)",
      "6800 》 3070.",
      "There’s no real future proofing with gpus, but if you want to at least have a good experience without spending crazy amounts of money, it’s better to stay at a mid range and upgrade more often than going with a higher end and trying to use it for a long time:\n\nIll use nvidia as an example.\n\nit’s better to upgrade to a x60/x70 every 1/2 gens, selling the old card while it still has some value so in the end, after the cost of the first card, it feels more like a subscription where you’re only paying the difference between the new card and sale price of the old card every year / couple of years.\n\nNot only you keep a good and constant performance that keeps up with games over the years, you do so without actually spending a crazy amount of money, you also keep up with newer technology.\n\nAlso don’t forget the power cost, people ignore that but at the end of the year, can bit quite a big amount depending on how expensive is electricity there… x60-x70 are the most efficient in power terms, deliver the most frames per watt so keep your power bill in mind.\n\nI mean, a 980ti, while still being slightly more powerful in raw terms than a 3050, it doesn’t have tech like DLSS, meaning it consumes like 2-3x the power while actually performing worse than the 3050 once you enable DLSS. I bet a rtx6070 in a couple gens will be much more desirable than even a 4090 is by then, and with the cost of the 4090 (and the high power bill), you can literally pay the x70 upgrade/sell cycle for many years, way longer than the 4090 realistic lifetime. So even a 4090, unless you need that performance now, wouldn’t be a good future proof GPU, even if it performed well these years, just because of the power consumption.",
      "If you can stretch a 6950 are not crazy to buy compared to a Nvidia line up. The only 2 down sides to amd is their rt is better and drivers can be more stable",
      "That is also a factor that I am considering, but the difference is not that big with our electricity prices.\n\nIn the recent past  is usually bought 2nd hand mid range or high end for € 200 each 3 years. But with 4k that is not a good option. So I need to increase the budget\n\nIn the ATi 8500 and 9800Pro era  I bought those two cards brand-new. But then, a high end card was costing €300 new instead of the 1000+ now.\n\nNew prices now are 649 for a 6800 XT, 699 for a 6900 XT and 1049 for a 6950 XT. Still the 6800 XT and 6900 XT are above my normal budget.",
      "Actual new Prices at the moment \n\n€649 for 6800 XT\n€699 for 6900 XT\n€1049 for 6950XT\n\nSo the the price gap to a 6950 XT is big",
      "Yeh, cards are too expensive nowadays, I haven’t upgraded my old ryzen 1600 and 980ti (i have one too) because of principle, im not going to pay scalper prices, and shops are still selling them at that, rather not play at all even thou the 980ti can still handle games well enough for 1080p (cyberpunk at high settings and fsr in 1080p still runs at 60 fps)\n\nBut I only got the 980ti because i needed the performance back then since i had a oculus rift, but before that i used to upgrade the x70 every gen from the gtx275 to gtx770 and it costed always under the 100€ per gen to do so after selling the old and it kept me playing the latest games at quality settings and the standard resolution of the time and i always had the latest drivers and technologies (shadow play, hairworks, etc).\n\nI skipped the 1070 because made sense downgrading from a 980ti, i waited for the rtx2070 but we know the story there… the gtx1000s where probably the last time we had reasonable prices.",

So a bit more normal, so the prices a dropping and stabilising.\n\n\nBut still deciding if I am willing to pay 700 euros for a brand-new Asus 6900 XT (or 650 for a 6800 XT)",
      "You never, ever ship a gpu to europe, not only they will still kill your deal with vat, you have extra fees for importing and you can also say bye bye to rma if something goes wrong unless you want to pay a lot in shipping.\n\nGpus are stupid expensive here in europe (I haven’t seen a rtx4090 for under 2000€ with the avg price being like 2200-2400€) i bet a 4080 here will cost as much as 4090 in the us, which is annoying as the majority of europeans still have much less purchasing power/expendable income (these high gpu prices are clearly being condoned and promoted by american buyers)",
      "Divide the avg fps by the price, at this point 50€ wont make much of a difference if you’re paying over 700€, but tbh, id check benchmarks, calculate the avg cost per frame of all current gpus and pick the cheapest gpu of the bunch (it will be probably still be one of the mid to mid high tier ones) and that would be my choice and new tier for the upgrade and sell cycle, just add just a bit of offset if you want technologies like ray tracing or not",
      "Yeah vat is a pia, I wish everyone would just use Australia's vat amount.",
      "Indeed 50 euros for 10% more fps, so could be interesting for the rest value or more lifespan on the long run\n\nFact is, that it is more fps and vram per euro in comparing to the nvidia cards, the 3080 is 900 euro here, 3070 ti 750 euro"

Keep in mind the AIB cards will likely beat the 3080 flat out a well.\n\nAMD has also said that at least through the end of the year, so you have a situation where the reference design is $100 cheaper and the AIB boards are $50-100 less for better overall performance in all non RT titles.",

The number of people willing to pay this much are relatively small: for every entheusiast who is buying cards somehow, there are the literally five people who asked me to make a cost effective build that I have flatly told \"not until prices come down\". I'm not upgrading any time soon, and I'm directing people to buy consoles when they ask me how to game right now, something I've never done before in my life.\n\nCompetition, theoretically, will help push prices down - Intel GPUs have to put themselves into some niche in the market, and amd and nvidia will want to respond, so once the market HAS supply then it might act rationally again.",

      "After few years of waiting for an upgrade i've managed to get here. I was casually gaming at 1080p and it was managable but decided it's nice to check 1440p / 144Hz as i was astonished with high refresh rate when seen it in action @ my friends house. That's why i discarded 4k60 from the list.\n\nGrabbed 5600x as there were plenty of them available here in Poland and lucked out with 6800xt with an order @ 15:16 local time at second biggest retailer. Didn't expect i would make it and received info from retailer, that it will be shipped in a month which got me sad. I wanted to cancel and wait for AIB drop next week, but then got a message next day that it's ready to be shipped.\n\nOriginally i wanted to buy 3080 FE but restrained myself until i will see what AMD will release with RDNA2. After reveal the choice was simple but still if i wouldn't get 6800XT, 3080 was my backup plan. I don't care about the brand, just about the performance.\n\nThis system is perfect now, 5600x with PBO boosts up to 4850Mhz if required. It's still a fresh lineup of CPUs so i think next AGESA / BIOS releases will allow for better OC.\n\n6800XT is just a monster for my needs. Some people reported coil whine but mine doesn't have any. Idles @ 50 degrees Celsius and goes up to 80 when gaming.\n\nFull system specs:\n\nR5 5600x  \nASUS TUF X570-Plus  \n16GB 3600 CL16 IRDM Pro GoodRAM kit (Hynix CJR) - still need to play a bit with it  \n6800XT Ref by PowerColor  \n750W Gold PSU  \n\nTo everybody waiting to snag the card / CPU: it's worth it.",

      "Haha, Sandy Bridge is really immortal, i've waited so many years but always had the feeling that it ain't worth it yet. \n\nFor the CPU choice i had the same and as i purely game (without streaming), went with 5600x as i really doubt those 2 extra cores will make a difference. Still at 1440p i will be more GPU limited than CPU.\n\nAnyway, both of them are great choice. 5800x runs a bit hotter form what i see (65W vs 105W TDP) but if you've got a proper cooling, won't be a problem.\n\nI have a friend who bought 5800X and is really happy about it.",

It should serve you well for years to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter getting my stimulus check I decided to finally build a new PC that would replace my PC from 2012 (outside the GPU). It was the PC below:\n\nCPU - i7-3770K @ 4.5 GHz \nRAM - 16GB forgot speed\nGPU - GTX 680 until a 980 ti the day it was released\nPSU - 650 watt\n\nAfter doing my research I learned that the new CPUs and GPUs were right around the corner. Luckily AMD was going to support the current AM4 socket for at least one more CPUs series. So I bought the following to hold me over until the new CPUs and GPUs launched.\n\nCPU - 3800X @ 4.5GHz all cores & IF at 1800 w/NH-D15 stable in games, not in stress testing\nRAM - DDR4 3600\nMB - Gigabyte X570 Aorus Ultra \nGPU - EVGA 2080 Super XC Ultra\nPSU - Corsair 850 watt\nStorage - 1x256Gb (OS) 1x1TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus (games) 6TB of HHDs (2TB & 4TB)\n\nMy plan was to wait until the new GPUs and CPUs dropped and buy the best for VR games. Yesterday I was finally able to buy a 3090 FE (not paying %300+ for the EVGA FTW3 3090) from Best Buy and I will be buying a 5900X as soon as I'm lucky enough to be able to click the \"purchase\" button on a website.\n\nAfter I get my 5900X I will use that computer for at least 5 years and upgrade again. The only thing that would cause me to upgrade before 5 years is if a part comes out that gives me 200% better performance than what I will have now or a game I must play isn't enjoyable because of my current hardware.\n\nI plan on buying a PCI-E 4.0 M.2 drive in the future but for now if I need more storage I will just pickup a large mechanical drive or a large 2.5\" SSD for gaming stuff.\n\nI might buy better RAM since it seems that the memory timings for RAM effect the CPU performance more than the previous Ryzen chips.\n\nSince I play VR mostly I think this rig will allow me to have fun for years to come.\n\nFinal PC Form:\n\nCPU - 5900X with a NH-D15 (OC not known yet since I don't own it yet)\nRAM - DDR4 3600 for now and IF at 1800 (1:1)\nMB - Gigabyte X570 Aorua Ultra\nGPU - 3090 FE\nPSU - Corsair RMX 850\nStorage - 1x256Gb (OS) 1x1TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus (games)",

      "Damn, i felt like 2500k was getting too slow in 2016 and then i upgraded to ryzen 1600x near end of 2017.\n\nI actually didnt expect that big of upgrade in gaming performance due to single thread performance being really about same when both are overclocked, but it was actually big improvement. Having done that i think that sandy bridge owners think improvement is less than you actually get by upgrading.",
      "It's like moving from HDD to SSD in terms of responsivness of the system and overall experience. Its just faster in everything what i do, even causual activities like web browsing seems to be more umm, fluent?\n\nFrom the gaming perspective, there's nothing even to compare now. Zen 3 demolishes my SB very much.",
      "Haha i fully agree. I think the time has come to really abandon old platform and get going with new shiny stuff.\n\nI restrained myself for so many years because Sandy Bridge was still delivering what i needed but i told myself it's time to go and do not look back.\n\nIt was a perfect decision :)",
      "That's a huge jump. I think one zen3 core would almost outrun that whole 2500k. Congrats."

We're in the middle of a VRAM boom and it's only gonna get worse. 8GB will be for 1080P low settings soon. 12GB is considered entry level now by game devs, with 16GB being normal and playing on ultra will require even more. We will likely see this change in the next 1, max 2 years.\n\nThis is why AMD put 20-24GB VRAM on RDNA3. It's also why 4070Ti/4080 owners are getting ripped off even harder than they realize. \n\nFor years game devs gimped their own games to fit into 8GB VRAM, but now that PS4 support died they have collectively decided..  nope. Textures alone will be 12GB or more.",
      "1080P with high details is hardly \"highend\"....",
      "4070Ti vs 7900XT will be a similar scenario in 2 years. Except then we're not talking $500 cards but $800 cards.\n\nNvidia really messed up here. Even if it's intentional to make people upgrade much sooner than the normal 4-5 year upgrade cycle, the backlash will hurt.",
      "and yet this would be a -40 vote comment in 2022 let alone 2020.",
      "Reminder that both the RX 6900XT and 6950Xt cost the SAME price as the 3070 Ti.",
      "Daniel Owen just did a review on 3070 ti vs 6950xt as they are priced the same (in fact the 6950xt is cheaper on average) and showed how, for the money, the 6950xt destroys the 3070ti, even beating it in many games with RT enabled.\n\nHe is also a very pleasant youtuber.",
      "NVIDIA Can do whatever they want because most gamers want their cards over any brand. Sadly.",
      "exactly, had a chuckle when the nvidia GPU still stutters with DLSS On.....",
      "It’s great that AMD is forcing the VRAM competition even if they couldn’t compete on the top-end. At least NVIDIA is being forced to lower their price or increase VRAM on the mid to low end.",
      "If you google it you'll find reddit threads from 1-2 years ago laughing about this topic and saying 8GB is fine and AMD is dumb for putting so much VRAM on their cards, that it's just a \"trick\" to sell their GPUs because they suck.\n\nThat's what Nvidia gamers were thinking. And keep in mind the ones on Reddit tend to represent the more knowledgeable portion of gamers..",
      "To be fair, DLSS doesnt do that much for VRAM usage.\n\nDigital Foundry on this topic:\n\n[https://youtu.be/hkBTOUOqUCU?t=4278](https://youtu.be/hkBTOUOqUCU?t=4278)",

      "This (vram) was a rising issue, 8gb don't cut it it's just people slow to catch up and pull their heads out of Nvidia's ass.\n\nAlso the 6800 nonxt seems like the golden goose of last generation of GPUs, enough horsepower to match or beat the RTX 3070Ti, 16GB vram, decent ray tracing and almost same or lower price than RTX 3070.",
      "I was debating between a 4070Ti or 7900XT, but this has definitely swayed me to the AMD GPU with its 20GB VRAM. I feel even 12GB is cutting it a bit fine these days.",

      "The fact that some games run normally on 8GB GPUs, but look like shit, even tho settings are set to \"high\" and \"ultra\" is really problematic. In the past you at least got low FPS and would scale down settings as a result, here you don't even get consistant settings, it is all over the place. I guess game developers prefer angry posts about poor image quality over angry posts about poor performance.",
      "That's actually their goal, they want to be an AI company in the not so distant future.\n\nIntel's total worth: $135 billion\n\nAMD's total worth: $148 billion\n\nNvidia's total worth: an eye watering $662 billion. More than double the worth of AMD and Intel combined. Despite having a lower annual revenue than both.\n\nAnd this has very little to do with their consumer gaming cards. They could stop production of all Geforce GPUs, focus entirely on their professional cards and still make bank. Especially with the razor thin margins on RTX4000 cards. Smart people have invested in Nvidia because of AI. \n\nAlthough, if you had invested in AMD in Q3-4 2022, you would have doubled your money by now too..  crazy swings, almost like crypto.",
      "And yet only 20% of steam users (from the latest survey) had more than 8GB of VRAM.  Either the devs are out of touch or they just want to cater to the high end."

The whole “unifan” design where you can chain them is game changing when it comes to cable managing. The back of my case looks more neat. They are easy to set up (6 wires in total for all the fans) and the diffused lightning look is great. The QLs I feel like has too many LEDs and can be too bright, along with having to cable manage 16+ wires and invest in the corsair ecosystem",
      "If the 6900 XT had this variant then it'll be slightly more desirable. I had a 3070 Founders Edition and it was hard to let go",
      "MSI's version to do the same is 200MB+.",

      "LOL I went from a 360mm rad to this, wanted to try something new. It's HUGE",

I went from a reference Vega 56 that I bought for 160€ right before the GPU craze, to selling it for 420€ during it and buying a new reference 6800 for 900€.\n\nThe difference in performance but also noise was incredible. Then I managed to sell my 1.5yrs old reference 6800 for 515€ and bought a 3 months old MSI Gaming X Trios for 420€.\n\nI run this thing at 2300-2400MHz with an insane 880mV, it's so quiet, even compared to the reference model, which I actually liked more design-wise. Really happy about the decision, though. These GPU's are crazy price to performance wise, especially in my market, where Nvidia is still overpriced. Wouldn't want to support them anyway, though.",

I'm hoping for price cuts across all their product ranges to remain competitive.",

      "Note, it's only 14% faster if you take those games out.\n\nI agree with you that AMD are being excessively greedy with pricing for the Radeon GPUs here. I can understand it with Ryzen, they've established themselves in that market, they are providing industry leading performance, they should charge a premium.\n\nBut with Radeon? Charging a 15-20% premium over the competition, with a worse software stack and worse features all around, for a 10-14% performance uplift is unacceptable. They need to aggressively take the market from Nvidia the same way they did from Intel with Ryzen back in 2018. RDNA2 is in many ways comparable to Zen+ and Zen+ was, and even still is, insanely good value for the performance you get out of it.",
      "I really really wish u/HardwareUnboxed would be more careful when arguing against the 8GB VRAM of the RTX 3070. They said:\n\n>and we've already got a number of examples where the RTX 3070 is hamstrung by its 8GB VRAM buffer: Doom Eternal using the ultra nightmare preset is one example, Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing enabled is another and there would be more to come surely (shortly?)\n\nWhy is the RT performance in Cyberpunk 2077 mentioned here? With RT enabled the RX 6800 would be almost unplayable. So how come this is mentioned as a shortcoming of the RTX 3070 versus the RX 6800?",

For $50 more you get equivalent rasterization, way better raytracing, and better features in the 3080. $600 would be a very compelling pricepoint and if the 6800XT were $600 I probably would have gotten it. Instead, I felt like the 3070 was the better pick for me (especially because I was able to find one).",
      "Where I am, the 6800 is $150usd more expensive than the 3070 cards and it's only $30usd away from the RTX3080.\n\nSo I don't know, maybe the 6800 vs 3070 makese sense in HUB land but where I am the 6800's competitor is actually the RTX3080. 3070 vs 6800 doesn't make sense for me personally because the 6800 is 10% faster but 30% more expensive",
      "Neither card is future proof and the VRAM won't change that.",

      "There is more to that recommendation than is perceived by most.\nIf they are smaller than 14 gauge cables then it is recommended to run individual cables. It actually has nothing to do with the amount of power running through the cables but the resistance of the wire itself. Wire degrades throughput by resistance to amperage requiring more voltage to move the amperage. This is why quality power supplies output 12.3v-12.5v on the 12v power wires. 14 gauge can handle about 28 amps before going below the 3% voltage drop required for critical or sensitive components.\n\nExample at under 2 feet for 14 gauge wire \n12v*25 amps is 300w total\nVoltage drop of 0.31 or 2.59%\nSo only 11.69V*25 amps or 292watts is actually making it to the end of the wire (graphics card). Shorter distance or bigger wire is the only way to lessen the problem.\n\n12v*28 amps is 336w total\nVoltage drop is .35v or 2.9%\nSo 11.65v*28 amps or 326w is actually making it to the end of the wire (graphics card).\n\nTo fully understand the issue look at a marine wire chart for amperage by gauge for critical components and a voltage drop calculator.\n\nhttps://www.bluesea.com/resources/1437\n\nhttps://www.inchcalculator.com/voltage-drop-calculator/"

The DRP4 doesn't have the clips stick out which means I need a flathead or knife to take it off.",

I actually went with an air cooler so that i don't have to tinker with it anymore and it has almost no point of failure in the future beside the fans and they can be replaced easily. big ones like this and the Noctua competitor run extremely quiet. i sent mine to max 60% fan speed and I get amazing temps.",

      "AMD confirmed that more reference cards will be made for all models. But given that at most AMD is only getting at most 60 GPUs per wafer and Nvidia is getting at most 50 GPUs per wafer for both companies largest dies, don't expect supply to normalize any time soon. Keep in mind that that's only 140,000 TSMC 7nm wafers processed every month in total. And AMD has between 44,000 and 70,000 of those (we know that no customer is over 50% and some customers have dropped without disclosing who the allocation went to). Nvidia is using Samsung 8nm and we aren't sure how many wafers they're buying or even how many wafers per month Samsung is making on 8nm versus their 7nm process. But total supply to Nvidia is likely between 100-300% of what AMD is using at TSMC for GPUs based on what numbers look like in wholesale channels.\n\nMy guess is that Nvidia probably has around 10k-15K wafers/mo for all of its Ampere products including the A100 which is currently out of stock with earliest possible delivery via air being listed as 3 weeks. And AMD is likely only dedicating 2-3K wafers/mo to their high-end GPUs with the vast majority of their TSMC 7nm wafer allotment being slotted for console APUs, processors, and low- and mid-range GPUs that are launching next year. Furthermore, AMD also is starting to fulfill CDNA which is a 120 CU  computer focused GPGPU solution for data centers which features better FP16, FP32, and FP64 performance compared to Nvidia's A100 and has already been ordered in bulk, along with the not yet publicly released new Epyc processors for the first two exascale supercomputers.\n\nOh, and to top this all off, we've had shortages of the following so far this year:\n\n* Screws\n\n* Shipping containers from China\n\n* Shipping containers to China\n\n* Air freight capacity due to decreased intercontinental flights and now vaccine deployment\n\nAnd all of that is affecting the ability to move produced products from Asia to the rest of the world.

Wouldn't be a hard decision for me to go for the 4080 if I was deciding between the two.\n\nAMD is delusional with their pricing this gen or maybe they just don't care and know they won't sell much at their current prices and are ok with it as long as the profit margins are high.\n\nNvidia is also delusional with their pricing this gen but at least they have a good line of cards and people justify paying more for the better features.",

      "the really ugly one is going to be 7700, where you're using almost as much N6 wafer area as a 7600 and then adding 200mm2 of N5P.  The MCM area overhead is atrocious.\n\nSo basically take a 7600 and then add three Zen4 chiplets worth of area, to slide performance upwards from 4060 to 4060 Ti performance.  Which it should edge past pretty easily ofc (4060 ti + 5-10%?) but it's gonna be a godawful deal for AMD.  Like I guess if it's 10% faster than 4060 Ti 8GB they do $429?  What an absolute waste of silicon from their perspective.  \n\nThere literally is not a number where that product is worthwhile - even at $499 it would be a waste of silicon for AMD compared to Zen chiplets.  And 7800 really needed to be sold for at least $600.  But the product performance just can't justify that.  This is Vega 2.0 where AMD is getting pinched by how poorly their silicon is performing relative to the established performance levels of the competition, and even AMD can't pretend it's an awesome deal at MSRP, but neither can they afford to go any lower on pricing.\n\nThat was when we saw the bundle deals (\"buy a GPU for $100 more than MSRP and get a coupon for $100 off a specific monitor nobody wants absolutely free, coupon expires in 30 days!\") and other crap kick in to shift ASPs upwards.  And even still, standalone MSRP was so low that partners couldn't actually make a profit on the cards they were ordering from AMD (\"made by AMD\" reference cards).  Everyone got real mad about that with NVIDIA a year ago, I think everyone forgot that was an AMD thing with Vega too lmao.\n\nI think the numbers have to be $499 for 7800 and $399 for 7700, *maybe* they will try for $529/$429 to squeeze a couple more bucks but at $450/$550 they are DOA.  DLSS alone is worth 10% to me.",

So yeah the 4GB of VRAM extra is nice, but the RT performance, DLSS and other features like NVIDIA Broadcast and just general driver stability or rendering performance keep the RTX 4070 lingering around as an option. The $100 pricing gap between the 7800 XT and the 4070 in the USA is basically not really a thing here.\n\nThe 7800 XT desperately needs a price drop here in Australia to be a relevant purchase. A good $80 AUD price drop puts the 7800 XT into a spot of consideration. But then I remember that a used 6800 XT goes for around $650 AUD, so unless you really use RT or want AV1 can't see a reason to buy a 7800 XT.\n\nAnother AMD graphics card release, another dead on arrival product here in Australia.",

      "Hubs video too. No significant change in performance. Thanks amd for blessing us with this massive W today. Same performance as last gens card something I have not seen on either nvidia or amds side in so long but hey. It's just $15 more expensive than last gens card so that's good ? Maybe...?

Also an important point is that 6800xt performance uplift via drivers is likely not going to happen anymore but 7800xt is likely going to get quite a few driver updates that improve performance. \n\nPlus I have seen reviews from 3 different sources running sometimes the same games and where Steve was getting better performance on the 6800xt the other two were getting equal or better performance on 7800xt. \n\nImportant thing to note, Steve was running the stock version of 7800xt vs sapphire nitro+ version of 6800xt. Jayztwocents was running the same version of two cards(red devil powercolor) and 7800xt was showing better results vs 6800xt. \n\nAnd I was hoping for exactly this, similar performance for less power draw and same price or cheaper. And it is in UK same price or cheaper.",

      "Great, so when can I buy one for MSRP?",
      "Yeah that's my point, the games list is different. Anno 1800 has been dropped for example and Assassin's Creed Odyssey has been replaced by Valhalla which is a big win for AMD and they've added Cyberpunk 2077. They've dropped Project Cars 3 which was a really bad title for AMD.\n\nThen other changes include the addition of Watch Dogs Legion, the upgrade to Hitman 3 from 2, and the removal of Star Wars Jedi in favour of Squadrons. So a good number of changes there that completely invalidates the comparison.",
      "How much are we talking here?",
      "Faulty reporting.  It hasnt \"increased\".   They tested different games, a bunch of them AMD partenered ones - Dirt 5, Valhalla, Resident Evil Village which place the AMD cards ahead. And many outlets dont retest older cards that might benefit from driver and patch uplifts.  So the newer released cards get benchmarked with newer drivers and patched games while results for 3080 and 3090 are showed from last year.",
      "Maybe its worth doing another fine wine investigation",
      "True, but it also depends on what titles you're comparing. As well as what graphics settings you're using.\n\nMSAA in use? AMD's probably winning due to the incredible pixel fillrate of 128 ROPs combined with 128MB of cache.\n\nSuper-heavy volumetric effects? Nvidia's probably going to win due to the big FLOPS advantage.\n\nAs for FineWine, it's probably going to be less of a thing with RDNA and RDNA2. The strength of RDNA2 is that the chips seems to be very well balanced and utilized, which wasn't the case at all for GCN. Even at GCN's launch, AMD needed more execution units to match Nvidia. Going back 9 years, AMD's gone from 2048 ALUs with the 7970, to 5120 ALUs with the 6900 XT.\n\nAmpere on the other hand, is a lot less balanced than previous Nvidia generations. It even exhibits similarities with GCN where higher gaming resolutions perform noticeably better when compared against previous generations. Going back 9 years, Nvidia's gone from 1536 ALUs with the 680, to 10496 with the 3090.",
      "20-25% so it is like jumping up 1.5 tiers to something between a 2080 super and 2080 ti and your card sits a little below a 2070 super. If you look at ebay sold listings prices, you can potentially get another $100 cash during the trade too.\n\n\nYour current card is a solid 1440p card at high settings so even if you sit on it and not trade up, you at least won't be struggling for playable framerates and settings (unlike my gtx 980 that is struggling at 1080p medium settings on a 1440p144hz monitor).\n\n\nI feel you about the prices. A $1200 rtx 2080 ti equivalent should be $500 right now. Gaming is a hobby and paying 2-4x more than a console for a single part is one thing but paying up to 3x the MSRP of a card is insane even if I can drop $3k on a 3090 without any financial strain.",

Both cards will be great.\n\nRyzen 5000 release on thursday might be a good indication about possible supply issues on AMDs side, even though CPUs are a bit different i believe.",
      "I'm wondering if Nvidia's supply bottle neck on the 3080 is Samsung making the GPU or micron making the gddr6x.  If we see 3070 (which uses normal gddr6) availability normalize faster than the 3080 it would make me suspect the gddr6x is what's holding back the 3080.",
      "i would say samsung. there have been a lot and long rumors about problems with samsung 8nm. dont forget 3070 isnt the same die as 3080 and 3090. 3070 is smaller and easier to make. \n\nsoon after 3080 launch there was a picture either from chip manufacturing lab or card manufacturing lab, of a 3080 cards or chips in testing. failure rate because of cooling was over 30% i think. that means at least 30% of tested chips didnt qualify as 3080 because they need too much power and cant be cooled properly if chips are running at advertised 3080 frequencies.\n\non other hand, the gddr6x maker had basically 0 rumors about problems with its manufacturing, and as other pointed out in older topics, they were making quite many very high speed ram chips, that would indicate their manufacturing process is in good shape. i know, its not quite the same because gddr6x isnt a industry standard but something memory company and nvidia made together for nvidia, and it doesnt automatically make gddr6x production yield quality as the ram chips they are making. \n\nbut from all the rumors floating around, i would say samsung is the issue, kinda. because there is also a rumor than nvidia is buying limited amount of big chips until samsung improves yields. i am not sure how this works and why nvidia would have to pay for defected chips and not just good ones, but thats the rumor.\n\nanother bad sign for samsung as culprit is that Ampere architecture, similar as Turing, has one of the worst performance jumps in generation in nvidias history. and it is with a node jump, from Turing at TSMC 12nm to Ampere at samsung 8nm. since Ampere launch, many are saying that samsung 8nm is not a a big jump for silicon from TSMC 12nm. \n\nfor full truth we will probably have to wait a few months though"

In recent times I have owned an RX 3070 (positive feelings as well) and an RX 6600 XT, which gave me some headaches because of ReBar Z390 compatibility issues, I'll admit, but I managed to get the best of it in the end. \n\nPositives for you with this card or rather a negative experience?\n\n\\*Since 2002 I have owned 8 GPU's (4 Nvidia and 4 ATI/AMD), so non-partisan consumer here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

      "Went from a r9 390 to a 1080ti to sapphire pulse rx 6800, all great cards honestly.\n\n\nNever had a problem with either brands.",
      "What hate ? Doesn't most of Reddit recommend the rx6700 and rx6800xt as the gpu to get ?\n\nPeople go for nvidia because it's either all they ever know or they really need ray tracing, upscalers and CUDA. Personally I can't stand upscalers(only game at 4k native) and the games I play either don't have ray tracing or it's an half assed attempt of it's implementation that changes very little, so radeon was the only logical option.",
      "This is a bit of a ramble that doesn’t really have much to do with the RX 6800 and more to do with AMD cards overall, but I guess this all comes down to that user’s personal experience. For the most part I’ve only owned ATI and AMD GPUs, integrated and discrete. I’ve had the odd Intel iGPU (and a couple of Arc cards) and the odd Nvidia GPU, but by and large, I have a love/hate relationship with AMD given my varying experiences of their cards. \n\nLargely, you can boil down a lot of peoples’ frustrations to drivers, power consumption and/or performance in a given scenario. Bad drivers are something I experienced first-hand on my R9 Fury X, which didn’t work on the Adrenalin 2020 drivers until the August 2020 drivers - and it took the final legacy driver patch in June 2022 to make official post-2019 drivers usable on it. I know drivers have burned a few people that I’ve talked to (predominately those with cards that AMD has neglected on Windows, like the discrete Fiji and Vega cards), but at the end of the day, your mileage may vary. \n\nAnd that’s what it boils down to: what does your setup and use case play nicer with? I had an RTX 3060 and while it was a performance uplift from my Fury X, I felt massively disappointed by it and decided to go back to AMD to get a 7900 XT. Outside of instability from my card’s high boost clock that I’ve had to fiddle with (2850MHz), I’ve been massively satisfied by it - and I don’t think I could’ve said the same about an RTX 4070 Ti for myself. This could very well go vice versa, too - I have a 4K monitor, which really leans into what the 7900 XT does best, but if I was gunning for HFR 1440p gaming, I could’ve lived with the 4070 Ti easily.",
      "A lot of people still dont buy AMD because the hate of the years ago are still somewhat in their brain.",
      "I went from R7 370 to 1660 Super to 6800xt.\n\nNo problems here either.",
      "I've had many cards from both companies. My experience was similar on both sided with pros/cons and minor issues at times.\n\nI love AMD for it's superior gpu software and interface (for my needs), but I like Nvidia for DLSS and better ray tracing (I don't use it much, but it's nice to know it's there when I do).\n\nI'll buy whatever feels like the best deal at the time, but I have a bit of a soft spot for AMD due to them making adaptive sync affordable.",
      "I ran Nvidia since 2008 till this year, it's the only GPU and software for that GPU that I really knew. It was a leap of faith that my RX 6750XT wouldn't mess up for fail me on what can honestly be a varied selection of games I play. Maybe there would be crashes or driver errors or whatever and maybe it was worth the $50 more to just get a 4060Ti and play it safe. \n\nIt has been the most boring fucking transition ever. I set it up and forgot about it as it just runs flawlessly if not better than my Nvidia card as I didn't have to scrub through emails to remember my login for geforce experience this time.",
      "The only thing I know that I'm missing is better RT. Some games it be nice to have a better playable RT experience. With my 6900XT, I generally just leave it off. Even with FSR2, the fluctuations are too extreme even when it seems playable. 80/90fps one second down to 35/45fps the next second. \n\nThe only upside is RT ATM overall seems meh. Not very noticable to me in SpiderMan or Fortnite and Hogwarts is so rough around the edges it isn't worth having on. \n\nGames I want to have RT, like Stray or DRG, don't sadly. \n\nThough it seems like RT on RDNA3 is greatly improved. \n\nOtherwise I'm happy with my pick. Maybe if I go Nvidia I'll notice more of what I am missing. I had upgraded from a GeForce 1660S. But at the end of the day I am still mostly focus on the most raster performance I can get for my money. When I got my 6900XT it was during the crypto boom so comparable Nvidia was like 600-800 dollars more at the time.",
      "I swore I would never buy a ATi/AMD card ever again after several bad experiences in the past. But the Covid shit show forced me into buying a RX 6800 XT. And it's been a great overall experience. No driver issues, great performance and the software experience with adrenaline is much better than what team green is offering. And considering how Nvidia is pricing their stuff now I think I will be sticking with AMD for the foreseeable future.",
      "Reddit loves AMD cards tho. So do all my YT suggestions i get.\n\nBuilt a new PC recently, 6800XT was the most suggested card everywhere in the price range i was looking.\n\nI decided to go with the 4070 in the end, but i really like that we have options to chose from. \n\nPower consumption plus more expensive PSU are not always counted in the comparisions tho. That was the deciding factor for me.",
      "Not as if nvidia were not just as hated (if not more) at different times.  \n\n\nI guess for a lot of people it might be the attitude around when they go their first machine.  \n\n\nMaybe I go more AMD since ATI was my third \"3d\" card, voodoo 1 add on being the first, but then again I have been nvidia a lot too. Hey my current laptop is (not that it gets used as much!).",
      "A lot of them hating on it have probably never tried DLSS themselves tbh",
      ">are we dealing with an irrational consumer\n\nNo. Most consumers like DLSS, Reflex etc and it is usually worth the extra $50-$100 over the AMD alternative. Most people also buy prebuilts, which almost never feature AMD cards.",
      "The problems people have with AMD are the fact they aren’t much cheaper than the Nvidia alternative and are lacking features. DLSS is sorely missed on AMD and they don’t even have an answer for framegen so going forward they are going to have some competition problems.\n\nThey aren’t bad cards, but there are some frustrating things. Issues with DXVK on older games, people having issues with VRR, Dolby Atmos issues, etc.",
      "The reddit cloud loves and hates on them. The reality is Nvidia has the mind share so the world outside of reddit really doesn't care. They buy Nvidia, it works, they move on. Without something to generate a lot of buzz, AMD feeds their niche in the GPU department and tries to claw back any ground they lost over the last decade. Last I read steam surveys had them at 8% market share and combined with other sources a high estimate of 12% is possible. \n\nI personally love the reddit AMD crowd. They're over zealous sometimes but hopefully Intels next GPU round does better and we get more people realizing there are alternatives. Nvidia sitting pretty at 90% market share and legions of investors isn't good for anyone in the consumer segment. We need all the viable options we can get.",
      "Nvidia is really driving the GPU industry with a huge investment in R&D, that's why. CUDA, Optix, RT cores, Tensor cores, DLSS, DLSS-FG for example.\n\nAMD is always responding, ROCm, HIP-RT, RT cores, WMMA instruction, FSR 1/2, FSR3, so while their raw raster performance is certainly up to snuff they're typically at least a generation behind on all the other bits.\n\nMost *gamers* don't care that much beyond raw raster performance so that's why AMD is such a good option in that space.",
      "Same, I've had an RX 480 and now an RX 6950...   Nothing but good experiences outside of Windows Update causing driver issues with Adrenaline Software...   But that's because Microsoft removed the option to disable automatic driver updates in the Windows Updater...\n\nDriver stability and issues are slightly better than my experience with Nvidia over the same period.",
      "sis kid had a 6800 soon 3 years, he is happy and me with a 6700xt runs stuff perfectly.\n\nvery few writes on social medias usually so ignore them works",
      "Funny enough you can not even use RT in any lower end Nvidia GPU because u run out of vram and they end up losing to AMD in many RT scenarios.\n\nYeah the freesync was amazing for AMD to open that up.\n\nAMD has done a scummy thing on Freesync is that they make freesync over HDMI (not the vesa standard in 2.0 and above) an AMD only thing and refuse to open it up.",

      "That’s crazy… here in the middle of Europe the cheapest 6800XT sits at 700€ (incl. VAT). For 970€ you‘d get a 7900XT…\n\nYou can basically decide between spending a lot and overpaying for the newest gen or spending less but still overpaying for an older gen.\n\nLast week a friend asked for advice for upgrading from an GTX 1080 with a budget of 700€ and the only thing I could tell him was „raise your budget or stay put for the time being“.",
      "Ha, I did a very similar upgrade...had a 2600x and 1080ti, bought a 3440x1440 ultrawide and couldn't drive it properly so thought...time for an upgrade. Bought a 5600x and then 6800xt (Red Devil) and am so impressed with the improvement. 6800xt is a beast.",
      "I also have a 3700x but for someone who also values some workloads, would the 5800x3d hurt me there? I been using my 3700x at 4.4 ghz stable for almost 4 yrs but was thinking to upgrade to 5700x. However, I heard it's not much difference if I did upgrade to 5700x. \n\nWhile thinking about the 5800x3d, I understand that it's better for gaming. I just worry about the workload on editing and basic things.",
      "How's 6800xt handling 2k ultrawide? How often do you hit 100fps+, or is it just hovering around 60? I was considering this GPU as i have the same specs for the screen, but i was worried a bit about future proofing.",
      "Pretty sure you would see a pretty massive improvement in any single or multithreaded workload over a 3 series. Clock speed isn’t everything, the architecture, cache etc are all going to contribute to performance. Not to mention if you plan on keeping this system for years why not just slot in the best processor you can get for the motherboard you already have, it could let you get another 5 years out of the system you already have. If you see one at the right price I say go for it.",
      "You could make a new account, Aliexpress style, but you know, depends on how much you care about contributing to the profit margins of Micro Center. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like Micro Center and wish to contribute to its continued success so I personally wouldn't do it, but individuals must make his own decision.",
      "6800xt user here, by 2k ultrawide did you mean 3440 by 1440? If so thats what i use, and for example in Modern Warfare both in the multiplayer and Warzone it sits above 100 fps comfortably at Ultra settings with 110 fov. \n\nI do use FSR cause i have a 144hz monitor so i want to get closer to that number, but i think even without that i think the framerate would still be good.\n\nIf you want to i could run a benchmark for you if i have the game!\n\nEdit: FSR is at Quality i believe",
      "Thanks!  Aside from a few small hiccups, I've been blown away by the 6800XT's gaming performance.  It's over twice as powerful as my 1080 was, and going by what limited ultrawide benchmarks I could find, I'm in 6900XT territory with a decent undervolt and overclock.\n\nAnd yes, I love this case as well.  Upgraded to it when I upgraded to Ryzen back in 2020.  The netting and dust guards have been invaluable as my computer sits in a room that loves to gather dust, and the cable management features are great.",
      "Yep, I've been really impressed with the performance increase.  I was looking at both the Red Devil and the XFX Merc as upgrade options, but the XFX card had the best deal going when I snagged it on Amazon.  Funnily enough, the last four AMD cards I've owned have all been from XFX, and they all worked great for me.  I think I've managed a pretty solid overclock on my 6800xt as well.  It's currently sitting at 2500-2600 core, 1035mv and averages 2560 in most games.  Memory is at 2150 (2140 actual) and fast timings, and power is maxed at 295W.  I've tried More Power Tool and upping the power limit, but I think my card is maxed.  Throwing more watts at it ups the heat but not performance.  How's the Red Devil been treating you?",
      "I’m on a 1080 but at 4K. If I was 1440p the 6800xt would have been perfect and I see them around 520-550 bucks. Decided to step up to an XTX which will be here in March. Can’t go wrong with the 6800XT if you’re in less than 4k, and even at 4K it’s still double or more than the 1080."

The power consumption in Time Spy is  around 285W, the card constantly boosts to 2500 and my graphics score is well above 21,000 while my hot spot temp is below 95c (reference card).

These Radeon cards have a high TDP but for what ever reason doesn't fully hit the power limit yet the stock voltage really heats up the card and can cause it to thermal throttle. So it's basically a balancing act between the 2. This is a very weak explanation,  videos on YouTube explain it much better. \n\nOh and tweak the fan curve too, the overall card Temps aren't bad but as u see on the software the junction temp on the card can get over 100, so tweak the undervolt and fan curve accordingly.",

I suspect UPS is almost as good as USPS because their employees actually give a fk about their jobs due to like USPS having a living wage and benefits due to a strong labor union.  FedEx and Ontrac are the worst with employees that for good reason don't give a fk.\n\n\n^(edit:)\n\n^(Ofc... for a hefty fee FedEx has a high security option where they will guarantee packages aren't lost or stolen during transit.)",

If it isn't retail employees cancelling your orders and selling your stuff to others, or warehouse workers disappearing entire pallets of goodies, it's drivers getting wise and running off with packages.\n\nWhat a garbage year for building a PC.",

    "comments": [
      "The 6800xt is over 200€ cheaper than the 3080 in Germany. Prise wise the 6950xt is about the same as the 3080. How do these two compare?",
      "Nvidia 30 series has always been faster at higher resolutions relative to AMD 6000 series, probably because the two architectures simply behave differently. The vram mostly doesn't play a role because apparently 10gb is still enough, but in the 3070 vs 6800 video you can clearly see how much the 3070 struggles. The issue is certainly overblown, some people think the 3070 is now useless when in reality it's just a matter of adjusting a few settings and it can still play very well, but the real problem is Nvidia putting only 8gb of vram on a GPU of that performance class. In the long run it's going to severely impact the longevity of the card.",
      "See the interesting thing is that at 4k (where vram matters most) the margin widens in favor of the 3080. Also interesting to note is HU reported that in hogwars legacy the 3080 ran out of vram but the 6800xt didn't provide a playable experience either. Maybe, just maybe, the vram issue is a bit overblown? For the most part, the lack of vram is not what's holding these gpus back",
      "6950XT is basically a 3090 level of performance. That's a no-brainer, Radeon wins.\n\nAnd the 6800XT is an even better deal.",
      "I was expecting to see this sub complain about HUB using so many RT titles, therefore swaying the % differences in favor of the 3080. Glad to see that’s not the case, at least not yet. In reality, anyone who bought a 3080, like myself, was interested in RT, so it definitely matters between these 2 GPUs, but I have to admit I was hoping to buy a 6800xt until a 3080 kinda fell into my lap during the height of the pandemic for close to MSRP.",
      "The \"vram\" issue is only about the fact that in 2023 you should not buy cards with low vram and expect not to encounter issues in 2024 in various ports or AAA titles coming out.         \nCards will work, you will be still able to play simply low vram have huge chance to impact quality of graphics you can use. \n\n\"Developers should optimize their games\" ... yes they should, but they will not do it as this require time and time means cost so something investors don't like.          \nLets be honest new titles will become more vram hungry and everything below 16GB at this point will need to be replaced somewhere in 2024.    \n\nFact that we get \"new\" cards in 2023 that have less than 16GB ram and cost >300$ is pretty much planned way to force users to buy new cards \"soon\".\n\nUnless like me you play in stellaris ... and stuff like Serf City.",
      "> Maybe, just maybe, the vram issue is a bit overblown?\n\nI think it's mostly misinterpreted. \n\nIf you have a 3070 8GB or especially 3080 10GB you should happily keep using it until either performance or outright VRAM limitations keep you from playing games at acceptable settings. You'll likely be able to use that card even at 1440p with minimal sacrifices for a while to come and enjoy a smooth gaming experience overall even in recent and near future titles.\n\nWhat the 3070 vs 6800 video did highlight was that we are approaching a threshold where VRAM capacity in the order of 8 (or 10 for that matter) GB is becoming a reasonable limitation in performance especially in the near future, bottlenecking otherwise excellent performance. Nvidia is still releasing 12GB GPUs at a $600 price point and even at $800 with the 4070ti (cheapest pc part picker prices). When buying new at that price point, it's not a bad concern to have if (like me) you like to milk a GPU until the end.\n\nI've had VRAM run out well before performance did in the past with a 780ti, it's a waste.\n\nThe 3070 and 3080 are still great cards, but the VRAM limitation should be a consideration to those buying new, especially since 16GB AMD cards are so comparatively cheap.",
      "same in Croatia, that's why i bought 6800xt and will sell 3070 while i can get some decent money for it.",
      "I'm just here for the comments :)",
      "I picked the 6800XT over the 3080 and they were at the same price. No way Im buying a 10GB GPU in 2023.",
      "Peformance class\nPrice class",
      "As a 6800XT owner there is nothing wrong with using RT on. It’s a very relevant tech now compared to launch, and in basically any game that has RT except for Cyberpunk I turn RT on. I still get playable frame rates so I figure why not use it (Dead Space, Callisto Protocol, Doom Eternal, Control, all ran well enough with RT) but the fact is I’d be getting much better performance with a 3080 at those settings.",
      "I upgraded from an RX 480 to an RTX 3080 back in 2020 and was able to get my card for around MSRP.\n\n\nFor me it came down to \"bad RT performance and no DLSS forever\" vs \"potential VRAM issues between now and 2024\". I rolled the dice and went for the new tech over the VRAM and so far it's been fine. I think TLOU's horrible PC port is the only game where you can't reasonably tune around the memory usage (not that there are many games where it's even an issue). Is it a sign of things to come? Really too early to say. Cyberpunk with full on pathtracing uses less VRAM than TLOU and Hogwarts.",

To be honest I can't say Ive ever seen so many people posting \"Ive always had Nvidia but theyve overvalued their cards\" or something similar lately.\n\nBeen loving the card, and can't stress enough to anyone on the fence that the 6800xt and 6950xt are totally worth looking at with current pricing. The only reason I didn't go with the 6950xt was I would also need a new psu and I just didn't want to do it as of yet.\n\nAlso, nvidia could learn from Adrenaline, control panel has looked and functioned the same since windows 98, needs updated.",
      "Yeah this makes sense. If we start approaching the point where vram is the main limitation, then ofc nvidia is messing by not increasing the vram of their chips. \n\nBut more specific to this video, so far the 3080 has aged better than the 6800xt, in direct contradiction to what a lot of people said back when both chips released",
      "6800xt is way better than 3070",
      "I still believe at the time the 3080 was and is a better card for near the same price. People on here overblow the Vram issue by a mile. More Vram for a 1440p card is not worth the crappy encoder (RIP Quest Users), no DLSS, dogshit UE4 VR performance and no Ai broadcasting at all. The 6800XT is still an amazing card and with it being $200 cheaper in some places it is the better card today but when both were around $700 idk why anyone would give up all those features so that one random Vram heavy game might work better tbh. The 3080s also have a much higher resell value compared to the 6800XT. People are selling 3080 used for $500+ rn.",

      "I was thinking about that since the shrinkwrap looks terrible. But two 8-pin PCI-E connectors is about $60 from Corsair...",

      "Indeed, welcome to the family.",
      "Yes, there is a technical reason. I don’t know the specifics of the technicals, but I do know that using two separate cables will provide more consistent clean power to the GPU.\n\nUsing that setup, take for example the +5v pin, two wires for +5v are being merged into one +5v pin on the PSU side (unless this cable also splits on the PSU side; but I’ve not seen that). \n\nWhile technically this does work and can work without problems, but if you decide to push the power limits and overclock, you could start to run to into some issues pretty quickly.",

      ">unless you want to keep your card for 4-5+ years\n\nShockingly, not everyone does yearly upgrades for the heck of it",
      "This isn't particularly an unpopular opinion, neither of the next gen consoles can get more than 10GB of VRAM and with features like DirectStorage coming to the PC which will allow you to stream textures directly to the GPU memory from a PCIe storage device the VRAM isn't going to be a big limitation even for textures which are absolutely insane and well above the point of diminishing returns. \n\nThe next gen engines are essentially built around asset streaming where both textures and geometry is streamed from fast PCIe storage directly to the GPU.\n\nI really don't know why AMD went for 16GB of GDDR6, could be just a numbers game, could be that their DCC color compression is still worse (still no DCC on ROPs for example) and it also looks like they will not be supporting inline compression for DirectStorage so they might need to compensate for that.\n\nAnd before people say remember Fury that's not the same case, the issue with the Fury was more complicated.\n\nThe Fury came out when consoles could already allocated more than its total VRAM (at least on the PS4 which allowed VRAM allocation of upto 6GB) and if a game say had to use 1GB extra than what the Fury could support you would be at a deficit of 25% that's a lot to swap in an out, and much harder to optimize for than 12.5-10% of a 8/10GB VRAM GPU today.\n\nThe APIs at the time of the Fury X were also much worse in terms of direct memory management, with DX12 and Vulkan you can do much better fine grain allocation and control combined with essentially zero copy access to system memory and to any memory mapped IO address space and you get a very different situation than 5 years ago.",
      ">  the unpopular opinion that 16GB isn't worth it for these cards.\n\nProblem is 16GB of VRAM might not even matter with these cards. They live/die on whether the infinity cache is being effectively used. If something is too large that there are a ton of cache misses the thing starts falling on its face. There exists the potential that nothing will be able to actually leverage that 16GB without slamming into the infinity cache limits like a truck into a concrete wall.",

      "These comparisons will always be interesting, but at  the same time pissing in the wind \n\nThe 6800xt is undoubtedly the better GPU, but the 4060ti will be more popular and outsell it regardless",
      "tl:dr; RX 6800 XT is:\n\n* 19% faster on average @ 1080p\n* 26% faster on average @ 1440p\n* 32% faster on average @ 4k",
      "Which is a damn shame. The 4060 series cards this generation are absolute dog shit, but people are already buying them in droves based on the latest steam hardware survey",

No but.. raytracing dlss 3d modeling ai something something the 1050ti literally had 0 advantages and it way outsold the 570. Kinda hopeless hoping people buy more amd cards today when it didn't happen back then. I just want some real competition which ultimately benefits the customer but if amd sells faster cards and Nvidia sells just as many cards as before we won't be getting that",
      "Prebuilts.\n\nOnce you realize like 90% of PC gamers are buying prebuilts, you will see why the 3050 outsold the 6700/6650 etc whatever.\n\nThe 4060/ti is going to be a huge prebuilt card, it’s likely going to outsell all of RDNA2 and 3 combined lol.",
      "In Germany the cheapest 4060ti 16GB is 550€, while the cheapest 6800 XT is 530€. DLSS3/frame gen and powerdraw alone should never be enough to warrant paying MORE for 20% less performance...",
      "RX 6800 16gb would be a better comparison, its faster, cheaper and more similar in efficiency.",
      "Now that would be shocking, given it's an *incredible* 128bit interface, compared to the 256bit interface of the 6800XT (and 3060 TI).\n\nIt truly is the worst card released in years.",
      "Well, still not regretting getting my 6800XT a year ago and for less than they currently sell for even.",
      "They use different nodes so die sizes aren't comparable. When you look at transistor counts (22.9 billion on 4060 Ti and 26.8 billion on the 6800 XT) you see that the 6800 XT has about 17% more transistors and is about that much faster at 1080p and even faster than that at higher resolutions. So technically speaking, in this situation, at higher resolutions AMD has better performance per transistor than NVIDIA, mostly due to the small 128 bit bus of the 4060 Ti. Also of course the 4060 Ti is the more efficient product because it uses the better node.",
      "Then don't watch it? It's really just that simple.",

For those who care, It's 23%, 30%, 37% without.  \n  \nWhat I found interesting is the 6800xt actually wins somewhat comfortably in most of the RT tests, but cyberpunk is notably where it loses badly. Not sure of the reasons (maybe it just does more ray tracing?) But now I'm realizing how often this game is used as a demonstration of the huge RT advantage Nvidia has, and - based on this data - it's actually an outlier. (Ie. AMD RT is obviously weak, but cyberpunk seems to exaggerate it)",
      "Literally no advantage?  How about power use?\n\nNormally that's not such a big deal, except the 1050 Ti can be entirely powered off the PCIe slot, whereas that's not possible for the 570.  That's a big difference for OEM builds where there's a premium just for a PSU that has a PCIe plug on it.",
      "I don't know, I do think it differs per region. In my area, the 4060TI 16GB is a cool 100 euro more than the 6800. That's not really a good comparison, as they are in a different price class.",
      "This is exactly why the 1050Ti did so well. It was the go to office PC upgrade card because it runs with no external power. \n\nI bought a 1060 6GB over a 480 8GB because the 1060 was marginally faster, used less power but also happened to be same price in stores! ~£230. \n\nIf you’re not winning the metrics you’ve got to win on price or you’re just not going to sell in to a dominant market. It’s pretty frustrating. \n\nIf the 480 8GB had have been 199 in store it would have been a no brainer.\n\nMan I wish 60 tier cards still cost those prices 😞",
      "Ada is impressive technologically. A damn shame they are just selling 30% over what they should.",
      "No problem, I hope he enjoys it.  \nHis milking helped me to buy RX6800 non-XT over 3070 and now I'm really happy that I went with his suggestions to buy 16GB card.",
      "I think the point is you can get the 4060ti and 6800xt for about the same price.",

I validated this with some benchmark runs (gaming and synthetic) and a socket wattmeter to measure any difference in total system power consumption (for which there was none between the two aformentioned drivers).\n\nI wouldn't worry - this isn't a case of new world bricking your GPUs like from a few months ago with those EVGA 3090s.\n\nHopefully this reporting bug can be fixed",

It's up to the manufacturer or AIB partner to ensure their limits and quality standards.",
      "The game did a thing that probably wasn't good (uncapped FPS menus).\n\nHowever, that shouldn't be capable of killing a GPU. Uncapped FPS Menus should be harmless, just a waste of electricity. Maybe make your PC kinda loud as all the fans ramp up to cool the GPU.\n\nIt was EVGA's fault that the cards _died_ due to it; because their firmware was incorrect. It's up to NVidia/EVGA to make sure that the firmware contains the proper power limits to prevent the card from self-destructing.\n\nThe game just happened to be the first time that conditions aligned correctly for the incorrect values in the firmware to actually cause _immediate_ hardware damage.

      "Nothing about this is shocking though. We knew the RT performance was pretty bad compared to Nvidia. It's their first generation, same as how Turing RT performance was terrible.  AMD is working on their own DLSS. And 4k difference comes down to memory bandwidth. I'm actually happy for the AMD crowd. It's about time there's a direct competitor to Nvidia. I'm a 4k player and have a 3080 but damn if this isn't exciting because it pushes Nvidia AND Amd to push the envelope. 1440p non RT performance is absolutely mind-blowing",

      "Those who are patient are now rewarded. The better value play here is the 3080 given these benchmarks given that it's only $50 more. People will buy whatever they can get their hands on, and if you're happy, great. But I think Nvidia's got my money for this round.",

AIBs cannot match the cooling performance of those for anywhere near MSRP.\n\nAnd yet every comparison ever is to the founders edition performance at MSRP price. When 99% of people owning 30X0 cards will have to pay more for partner cards of equivalent or worse cooling. Just to get parity with founders edition you have to pay $50 more for the best value AIB cards due to overclocks.\n\nThe channel, Moore’s Law is Dead was dead on about this. The FE price and thermal performance is locked in for reviews but most people will have to pay slightly more for either shittier cooling or a lot more for a card with parity. \n\nFor those lucky few getting MSRP FE 3080, it’s a great deal.",

      "Wait people (and not just bots) can actually win the AMD drop? Whole family has been trying for a year no luck! Congrats, nice to see a win for a real person!",
      "6900xts are pretty wildly available now for msrp or near msrp.  Newegg and microcenter have them.  They are third party cards. So a little more expensive than msrp but not bad at all for an aib.",
      "Thank you all, last Radeon gpu I had was a 9550 SE back in 2004! I've had the 6900 for only a couple of days but it really is a beast",
      "You will never see amd msrp again.  Unless you get a reference card.  Microcenter isn’t inflating the price, aib are.",
      "The packaging for the 6900XT from AMD is almost as nice as the card.",
      "Yep, managed to get it at msrp on the weekly amd drop (I'm in the EU). I tried for a while though but never got lucky and I've always had \"more than an hour\" in the estimated waiting time. But two weeks ago the queueing system put me in the top of the line 🤟🤟",
      "How much are these cards? Were you able to get it msrp?",
      "Every Thursday, at around 16:00, the AMD store start a gpu selling event (each drop has a different number of cards available, sometimes not so many, other times, like last week, drops are more consistent)\nYou will be placed in a queue, with the position on said queue assigned randomly. If you are lucky enough to be on the \"front positions\" of this virtual queue, you will be able to enter the online shop and buy one gpu.",
      "That's gonna be a huge jump. I went from a 970 to a 3070 ti and the jump in performance was enormous. Games that used to struggle to get 60 fps at 1080p medium settings are now running at 1440p 144+ fps at high settings (plus ray tracing in some games) \nI mean a game like doom eternal struggled a lot with my 970 at 1080p medium and now with dlss I can run the game at max settings, 1440p with ray tracing and get 144+ fps.",
      "Yeah you will...because the vast majority of PC gamers will not pay $1500 for a mid range GPU. I know I sure as hell won't.  If the prices don't come back down to some semblance of normalcy after the chip shortage is over. You're going to see the death of PC gaming. I love gaming on my PC. But there's no way I could ever justify a $1500 or $2000 video card when I can get an XBox Series S for $300.",
      "Am I the only one who thinks the RX 6000 reference cards look orgasmically good?",
      "That's a solid upgrade. You just went from hardly being able to play VR to playing on high settings. \n\nStrongly recommend a VR headset for your next buy if you don't have one. Congrats!",
      "Went from an RX580 8GB Sapphire Nitro+ to a 6800XT reference model.\n\nStill have my rx580...could've sold it for 150-200% the cost I paid for it..but I dunno.. sentimental value.",
      "What's your in game mhz?",
      "I'm in the EU, as well. What is this weekly AMD drop you talk about?",
      "Yep they get regular shipments.  Multiple a week.  The only issue is AIB companies have jacked their prices up so high it’s insane.  Between the component shortages and tariffs, they really ran with the price increases.  But this affects Nvidia too.",
      "From what I understand they are mostly abandoning the idea of MSRP in the GPU business right now. They've completely surrendered to scalpers and others driving prices up and decided to join them instead. This is partly due to everyone competing for space at TSMC instead of manufacturing their own stuff.",
      "God a 1060, how antiquated, send it to me and I'll 'dispose' it responsibly (cries on 750 Ti).",
      "This right here. MC has reference PowerColor 6900XT, 6800XT, and 6700XT in bulk pack boxes even. The 6900XT is 1399, 6800XT is 1099, and the 6700XT is 799. Better than their non reference where a 6800XT is 1349. However however still a good 300-400 over what AMD direct reference cards are. Tides are changing though. They keep getting more and more cards in quantity and model across the board and they are sitting on the shelves. So either people are giving up and holding out for new model drops, miner demand is easing, overall supply chain logistics are calming down or combination of those. So they certainly aren’t unattanium anymore. However pricing hasn’t yet really shifted accordingly.",
      "Got a merc319 6800xt the day XFX released them for MSRP.  Card beats the hell out of the 2080ti it replaced."

    "title": "Is my brain working right? Is this what we're thinking in terms of performance for 7900 XTX? Assuming it is 1.5x-1.7x over a 6950 XT.",
    "selftext": "",
    "comments": [
      "No. This is right. This is what AMD claimed.\n\nWe can't tell how true the numbers are until we get to benchmark it ourselves, though. But it looks great.",
      "Use the Techspot / Hub chart instead. TPU tested with a 5800X which did cause some slight CPU bottlenecking at 4K with the 4090.\n\nTechspot had the 4090 scoring 144fps in the 4k 13 game average and the 6900XT scoring 77 fps. The 54% perf/watt claim was for a 7900XTX at 300W (sneaky bastards) so that gets us to 119fps @ 300W. The extra bit of wattage will allow higher clocks but I expect that causes the perf/watt to drop off (otherwise AMD would have just compared stock vs stock like in prior launches) so lets say that extra 18% power only increases performance by 10% (might be generous but I don't know). That gets us to 130 fps in Techspot charts. Their 6950XT scored 85 fps in those charts and 1.54x that is 131fps so it is close IMO.\n\nGiven that that would make the 4090 about 10% faster than the 7900XTX in raster.\n\nThe 4080 16GB in the NV slides was about 20% ahead (using fantastic eyeball maths!) of the 3090Ti. That card scored 91fps in the techspot chart so that puts the 4080 16GB at around 110 fps.\n\nSo stack will probably look as follows for raster\n\n* 4090        144 fps ($1,600)\n* 7900XTX  131 fps ($999)\n* 7900XT    115 fps ($899)\n* 4080 16   110 fps ($1,200)\n* 4080 12   90 fps ($900) - or whatever it renamed to\n\nFor RT it might be more like (I did raster * 0.65 for NV and raster * 0.5 for AMD here)\n\n* 4090       94 fps ($1,600) 66 fps with new scaling\n* 4080 16   72 fps ($1,200) 51 fps with new scaling\n* 7900XTX  65 fps ($999) 41 fps with new scaling\n* 4080 12   59 fps ($899) 41 fps with new scaling\n* 7900XT    55 fps ($899) 37 fps with new scaling\n\nSo if you want RT performance then 4080 16 is not terrible, about 10% or so more performance for 20% more money. If you want raster then 7900XTX or XT are both good. If you want both you spend the $$ and go for a 4090.\n\nEDIT. I went through and checked the RT scaling at 4K in the games techspot tested. 4090 came out at 0.46x and 6950XT came out at 0.31x. Assuming the 4080 and 7900XTX are similar to those numbers I have updated the numbers to reflect that. It pans out that perf/$ is looking to be about the same for RT performance between NV and AMD but AMD will hold the advantage in raster which might offset the features NV have for some people, time will tell.",
      "Remember they did not compare it with the 4090 on purpose very different form last time when they showed 3090 on the charts. The 70% improvement is likely very rare and in a select few games. Expect the averages around 40-60%.",
      "I think AMD has been pretty accurate in their performance claims these recent years. They also don’t shy away from showing negative results",
      "90% performance at ~85% power and ~$600 cheaper is still quite good tho.",
      "All the marketing bullshit aside its probably 1.5x. Still impressive fps/$.",
      "But the benches they showed were still accurate.\n\nJust like i  this they didnt show a 4090. But based on their claims we know it is right around a 4090 in perfor.ance (assuming it is accurate which is tbd)",

      "Its not right. This benchmark is using a 5800x which bottlenecks the 4090 even at 4k. The other issue is that AMD only showed 6 games and said 'Up to 1.5x and 1.7x the 6950' this is the best case scenario, not the average one.\n\nIf the 7900 XTX was faster than a 4090 or even a bit slower AMD would've given us detailed performance benchmarks, but they completely avoided it, just like they avoided comparing Zen 4 to the 5800x3D.",

      "Slow down buddy lol. You've got 14-30 days to reconsider your purchase. I'm aware this is a pro-AMD subreddit, but there's no sense in making split decisions without knowing how these cards compare. With that said, you could use the money saved to invest in a full AMD build that'll surely out-pace a 4090 FE 👍",
      "I hope the 7900XTX humiliates the 4080. On paper the 7900XTX should destroy the 4080 with ease. 12 billion more transistors, 20-30% more bandwidth, 4GB more memory.. Die size of the 4080 is just 380mm2. 7900XT is like 520mm2 with chiplets included.",
      "Yeah, I mean we're talking about a freaking $600 price difference. That's a whole ass 6900xt (current) price difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish people had more sense than money.",
      "I mean that's not them being inaccurate, they just didn't make that comparison cause they didn't like it.",
      "Don't forget these are \"up-to\" numbers from AMD - not average like all other benchmarks.  The real average numbers are going to be much less than what the maximum frames are.  Even more so depending on your CPU.",
      "If you care about ray tracing a lot you should keep the 4090 order, a 60% RT gain over the 6950 XT won’t place the 7900 XTX anywhere near the 4090.\n\nIf RT isn’t a big concern however, it looks like AMD will be much better value at the top end."

A massive amount of work has been done to untie these from X and make them stand on their own.\n\nThis allows things like graphics outside of the display server, using 3D acceleration on a headless server, passing references to graphics buffers between processes without copying them to the CPU, etc.\n\nIf you've ever heard of Wayland, it uses all of these separated components to provide a modernized display server.\n\nThe Nvidia drivers pretend this all doesn't exist and doesn't support any of it. When Nvidia was asked to support the features that literally every GPU support by Linux except for Nvidia does, they said they didn't like how it was done and supporting it was too much work for them.

It used to be *much* more common in the era when you got some junky ”500w” thing with your case.)",

Not sure what else is drawing power, but a physical HDD runs about 5-10 watts/each drive.  Not sure about memory.\n\nI think AMD or EVGA is at fault for this one.",

      "Hello, someone with engineering experience here -\n\nIt's not bullshit. The failure mode is pretty simple:\n\nPower = Voltage * Current.\n\nPower supplies provide a fixed voltage (12v). Card draws whatever current it needs to meet power demand.\n\nCard demand goes up. Card tries to draw more power than psu can handle. Psu begins to sag, voltage drops below 12v.\n\nCard has the same power demand, but is now being fed lower voltage. Power = Voltage * Current, if power is same and voltage goes down, current has to go up.\n\nCard draws more current to try to meet power demand. Psu sags more, voltage goes down, card getting less power per unit of current and thus increases current draw to make up.\n\nVicious cycle.\n\nUsually a psu's over-current protection will trip out and your rig will be safe.\n\n1. Not all psu's have good OCP.\n2. What happens if power demand is riight below trip point? Psu keeps running, but card is being undervolted and continues to draw higher than normal current.\n\nSo the card keeps running. But then, current through some component causes it to heat up too much. Component begins to fail, usually by becoming a short. Draws looots more current now and milliseconds later pops.\n\nEt viola, dead computer smell.",
      "I'm sorry for your experience. But that is definitely not what happened here. \n\nYour PSU and cabling might've overheated because of the high current that it couldn't handle, and that heat might've transferred to your GPU and done it in as well.\n\nWhat happened with OP though was the opposite. If anything it sounds like a short or overvoltage on the GPU itself, maybe it blew a capacitor as a result. You wouldn't see the type of failure OP saw from an overheat of the PSU due to a current level above its rating.",
      "wtf... whoever came up with the idea that a lower wattage psu caused your 6900 XT to explode should lose their job, that makes zero fucking sense, also amd officially recommends 750w and even then 650w is more than enough",
      "TL:DR: Most likely the GPU would work after you use soldering iron to remove the burnt component and cleaned with PCB cleaner. If they refused to pay for a warranty, i think it is worth a short in repairing this GPU.\n\nFrom the picture, it seems like a ceramic capacitor has exploded. My guess would be that the ceramic capacitor itself has some QC issue and it starts to degrade faster than normal and a leakage current started to flow through them. When the leakage current is high enough, it would burn. Since the package size is small (either a 0805 or 0603) ,even when it is \"burning\" there is still a relative small amount of current flowing through and i won't be worrying that the extra current would damage the large power plane inside the PCB. \n\n(I don't have the power ratings for ceramic capacitors, but usually resistors in that package could only handle 250mW before the burn, which is just a small fraction of power compared to 300W+ that the GPU would suck in)\n\nSince you said the GPU is still running when the component is burning. I think all the power rails would be working.\n\nIf you have a multimeter, you could use connectivity check function to check if there is a short circuit between the black capacitor with the lable C604 across it (should be the main power rail to GPU) and between the small across the brown capacitor C630 that is right beside the burnt component. If the power rail is not short to GND. I think it is very likely that the GPU could boot up again after the burnt component is removed with soldering iron and is properly cleaned. That ceramic capacitor should be used for filtering the 12V voltage right before the input of the buck converter.  Usually there are a surplus of them soldered on the board and missing a couple of them should be fine as long as the power rails are not short circuit to each other and the GPU + VRAM are still in working condition.\n\nAnother tip when asking for warranty is always play dumb. Always say that you used the recommended part and you have never touch any setting of the GPU and it just blow up on its own. The more specific info you provide, the more likely they would find a bullshit reason to refuse the warranty claim",
      "It’s an easy way out, if op didn’t say what was their psu, it would fine, any company will use anything in their favour  to deny warranty, happened to me with my car",
      "It took out one of the 5870’s as well, forgot to add that it also melted one of the power cables. Nothing major but the case was smoking for a good 10min. I posted this over in the AMD forums about a decade ago. If I find the post I’ll link so you can see the damage.",
      "Switch mode power supply, MOSFETs could have failed to open for a brief period of time causing more than 12v to be fed into the gpu...\n\nThough I would have expected EVGA to have overcurrent protection to prevent this from happening.",
      "I agree with your general sentiment here, but from my reading of OP's post, the PSU hasn't failed. Moreover, his PSU looks pretty decent (650W 80+ Platinum). He said he swapped in a low-end GPU for the time being and the PC is working again. \n\nConsequently, I'd pull the blame away from the PSU and put it towards the build quality of the GPU. OP was running the GPU stock as well, so its electrical load under gaming (in combination with the efficient 5800X3D) should've been manageable by their high-quality PSU. \n\nWhat you said does make sense though, so I'm not discounting that. I just don't think that's the case here."

If you can get the 6700xt for ~70€ less than the 6750xt I would be more inclined to go that route as opposed to the 6750xt (MSRP prices compared).  Now, if the 6700XT is around the same price as the 6750XT that changes things.  Performance difference is minimal (2-5% from what I have seen).\n\nAs far as either vs the 3070Ti, that is a personal value proposition.  The 3070Ti has much better performance in many games and doesn't really ever lose to the 6700/6750XT.  It also has better ray tracing and includes DLSS.  Is that worth the price difference?  Very personal question.  I recently went back and forth on the same thing, and decided to go ahead and get a 6700 XT from AMD Direct.

Should have done a refresh like 2080->2080S than this garbage\n\nI hope marketing students use AMD and Nvidia as case studies, because this is a perfect illustration of how mindshare warps the reception of a product.\n\nThe RTX 2080 --> 2080 Super was a significant price increase. You got 10% more performance for 20% more money. The 2080 Ti should've been $700, the 2080 should've been $500, and the 2070 should've been $400.

You get 3090 Ti performance for almost half the price, but this is apparently not enough.\n\nThe 3090 Ti ($2000) and 6950 XT ($1100) are neck-and-neck, yet Nvidia get praised while AMD get slated.

      "This is probably result of using this particular card type with this particular PSU. The strongest coil whine will appear if card draws power at a pattern that happens to be a resonance frequency of the PSU coils. Probably both EVGA models were equipped with the exact same coil, resulting in whine.",
      "Update 1/19/21:\n\nEVGA contacted me regarding whether or not they could help with RMA. They said that since the 750W G2 Supernova Gold was purchased as an \"EVGA Certified\" product EVGA reduced the warranty from 10 years to 1 year which means that even though the product was like new directly from EVGA, the warranty expired a couple years ago. They count the day it became \"EVGA Certified\" as the first day of warranty and not the first day the consumer purchased the product.\n\nBackstory:\n\nI upgraded my GTX 1060 6GB to a RX 6900XT. For first time ever in rig I heard awful coil whine that could be heard in the room next door. I'm an RN and used my stethoscope from work to assess PC before I blamed the GPU entirely. Turned out almost all of the noise was originating from my EVGA Supernova 750W G2 Gold PSU.\n\nMy first thought was maybe the PSU was always bad but I never realized it because my 1060 never put that much load on it for me to notice. I went to Best Buy and bought a new EVGA 700W Bronze PSU to test and the noise was almost identical.\n\nI decided to try one more PSU but from whatever other brand Best Buy had. I exchanged the EVGA for a Corsair RM750W Gold and the PSU buzzing went away entirely. There's still a tiny bit from the GPU only, but it's enjoyable once again to play games/music at night in quiet room while the kids are sleeping.\n\nI hope this might help someone exploring the same problem.",
      "Most brands have high and low quality units. \nIn general, if you are seeing a particular wattage for much less than others (wow, saving ten bucks!) you are often going to end up with much less clean power. \n\nOne of the most consistent PSU brands is definitely Seasonic though.",
      "Do you think it has anything to do with the brand? Or is it possible I was extremely unlucky with two EVGA units?",
      "Seasonic as a brand is still top-notch, agreed. They also make a lot of OEM units for other brands. I think some (usually more expensive) Corsair PSUs are actually made by Seasonic as well.",

      "My 2011 vintage Corsair HX750i started screaming at the slightest provocation (even SSD load) before I replaced it with a Seasonic TX-750.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy reference RX 6800 XT had slight bit of whine that got better after the first few days, but dear lord, if you put an EK waterblock on your card, and you opt to also put a backplate on, don't tighten down the central 4 screws, else the backplate becomes an emitter for coil whine that projects it across the house.",
      "Yeah the backstory made it more clear. I have coil whine on my 6800XT, my PSU is fine. It's an SF750 so it better be, since it's a 80+ Platinum :D",
      "Yes. I picked up an RM850i Corsair PSU, and it was refurbished, right from Corsair’s factory in Texas. You get the OEM box, instead of Corsair’s fancy box and it has a tiny Seasonic logo on it.\nPerfectly quiet PSU, btw.",
      "I have the XFX 6800XT 319 Merc. It uses the same PCB and power delivery system from a 6900XT. \n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't fit in my computer case so I am waiting for a new case to arrive. As a result, it's on my open test bench, about 6\" to the left of my keyboard. Fortunately, it's the very first GPU I've owned where I cannot hear the coil whine. My 2080ti FE, 1080ti FTW3, and GTX690 all screamed and whined like banshees and we're audible from inside their respective chassis.\n\nI've used Seasonic, SilverStone, EVGA, AND Corsair PSUs and it's never made a lick of difference in GPU noise. There was probably something else that changed in the power equation (i.e. surge protector or power cable).",
      "\"bequiet\" ironic",
      "ho jesus that actually happened to me! GTX970 going like 8000fps on the game Symphony on steam. This was my first time hearing such noise i thought my pc was gonna blow up!",
      "In my experience, it's just a tossup if a paired combo whines or not. For example:\n\nPSU1 and GPU1 has coil whine.\n\nPSU2 and GPU2 has no coin whine.\n\nPSU1 and GPU2 has no coil whine\n\nPSU2 and GPU1 has no coil whine.\n\n\nCoil whine doesn't mean the card sucks, or the PSU sucks, it just means that together they are causing those caps to resonate at an annoying frequency.",
      "> This is probably result of using this particular card type with this particular PSU.\n\nWe recently got back an EVGA 750BQ power supply from a client complaining about coil whine in the PSU. I tested it with a GTX 560 (my work computer) running the Heaven benchmark. Tons of coil whine and very noticeable, especially when it transitions between scenes. It was very similar sounding to the 700BR in this video.",
      ">But have you ever heard a 970 doing 8000fps on main menus? Awful.\n\nI have. And mine have been completely silent all the time I've had it. However, a friend recently borrowed it, and he called me to complain about the coil whine.\n\nSo I'm pretty sure it's the specific configuration, most like the PSU, that's the real culprit here.",
      "FPS limiter at for example, 300, has absolutely no downsides.\n\nAs long as it's slightly above the refresh rate, you're fine.\n\nI'm running a 70hz display and have a global FPS limiter at 100, and everything works well with no inputlag whatsoever. No tearing issues, either."

      "AMD confirmed that more reference cards will be made for all models. But given that at most AMD is only getting at most 60 GPUs per wafer and Nvidia is getting at most 50 GPUs per wafer for both companies largest dies, don't expect supply to normalize any time soon. Keep in mind that that's only 140,000 TSMC 7nm wafers processed every month in total. And AMD has between 44,000 and 70,000 of those (we know that no customer is over 50% and some customers have dropped without disclosing who the allocation went to). Nvidia is using Samsung 8nm and we aren't sure how many wafers they're buying or even how many wafers per month Samsung is making on 8nm versus their 7nm process. But total supply to Nvidia is likely between 100-300% of what AMD is using at TSMC for GPUs based on what numbers look like in wholesale channels.\n\nMy guess is that Nvidia probably has around 10k-15K wafers/mo for all of its Ampere products including the A100 which is currently out of stock with earliest possible delivery via air being listed as 3 weeks. And AMD is likely only dedicating 2-3K wafers/mo to their high-end GPUs with the vast majority of their TSMC 7nm wafer allotment being slotted for console APUs, processors, and low- and mid-range GPUs that are launching next year. Furthermore, AMD also is starting to fulfill CDNA which is a 120 CU  computer focused GPGPU solution for data centers which features better FP16, FP32, and FP64 performance compared to Nvidia's A100 and has already been ordered in bulk, along with the not yet publicly released new Epyc processors for the first two exascale supercomputers.\n\nOh, and to top this all off, we've had shortages of the following so far this year:\n\n* Screws\n\n* Shipping containers from China\n\n* Shipping containers to China\n\n* Air freight capacity due to decreased intercontinental flights and now vaccine deployment\n\nAnd all of that is affecting the ability to move produced products from Asia to the rest of the world. Not to mention the fact that shipping is taking longer due to COVID-19 mitigations that slow down the loading and unloading of ships, planes, trains, and trucks.",

      "No. The mining craze was way worse. I know it first hand because I bought my RX 580 back then and I remember that I had to wait for months to get it.\n\n\nIt eventually got to a point where the only card that was readily available was the GT 1030 (even the RX 550s were selling out immediately). At least currently I can still buy an RX 5000-series card or an RTX 20-series card if I needed to.",

That MPO issue drove me nuts as I thought that it was just AMD drivers being AMD drivers.\n\nTurning off hardware acceleration is not a workable band-aid at that. I was pulling my hair out from audio cutout when I watch youtube after doing that. I can now safely conclude that the whole thing about AMD driver sucks isn't really an excuse anymore.",
      ">while others, again using the same GPU and drivers etc\n\nThat doesn't even come close to covering all the possible differences.\n\nSome people for example fixed black screen issues by turning off their RAM overclock.   Just because an app crashes for some, and not others, could be hardware, but it could also be all sorts of other software.  MSI Afterburner for example was known to cause crashes for some.  Windows has bugs and features that are only active for some in some situations (e.g. only with multi monitor with different refresh rates but only if all support 10 bit color).\n\nSo \"one friend with drivers ABC and card X has the issue but the other does not\" is nowhere close to proving that it is bad hardware.",

Like someone was fiddling with my display port cables, but it was across all 3 screens at the same time for 1 to 2 frames, then would dissapear.\n\nI was never getting driver timeouts, just the black screen flickering and video issues in other windows in chrome, what fixed me was using the #angle workaround in chrome.\n\nSince then, for me, its been perfect on 22.9.1, no issues AT ALL.

I painstakingly went back and forth in various areas turning RT on and off…long story short, youre missing very little.

The power consumption in Time Spy is  around 285W, the card constantly boosts to 2500 and my graphics score is well above 21,000 while my hot spot temp is below 95c (reference card). Since you have an AIB card and a Zen3 CPU, you should get even better results.",

      "Great looking build and awesome GPU! Just a little advice I would not use pigtail pcie cables with that high end of a GPU that draws a butt load of power. You have a decent PSU but you need to use a dedicated cable for each 8 pin connection and if you dont have that many pcie connections coming from your PSU you need to get a higher rated one that does. At the least you can lose performance (been shown on Jayz2cents and BuildZoid's channels) and at the worst you can damage your GPU and PSU.",

      "With OP's Seasonic PSU, I wouldn't worry at all - it's built for this!\n\nLarger diameter cables and a matching internal design [single rail(!), bigger caps to handle transients, higher rated mosfets, thicker cables] make sure that drawing 300W and more over that daisy-chained cable isn't a problem. \n\nThe \"weak points\" are the connectors and those are also what's rated for those 150W each.\n\nHowever, an 8pin EPS is built the same when it comes to the physical pin design, i.e. thickness of the metal and contact area (only difference: EPS uses 4 12V pins instead of 3), is rated for 336W and regularily pushed higher in servers. Accounting for having one 12V pin less, a PCIe 8pin is still good for at least 252W.\n\nParticularily in OP's case, these two cables with 3 connectors can definitely and comfortably provide enough power for the GPU, AND have some headroom left. In cheaper built and multi-rail PSUs, having more cables is needed, but not here.\n\nI have also verified this with my HX850i by pushing a Vega 56 to 360W ASIC and now with my 6800XT. Performance difference: zero. EMI is reduced by using more cables though.",
      "Awesome! I would refrain hitting your GPU with a heavy work load until you get rid of that pigtail. From what users like the other commenter have noted 400W power draw from there 6900/6950xt's. The max rating of an 8 pin pcie cable 150w/12.5a, so with only 2 cables the most you can safely pull is 300w so you really need that 3rd cable stat!",

There were 6700xt in stock 45 minutes after the queue opened last week so don't just nope out if you get a long queue time.

Don't refresh the page too quickly or you'll get softbanned when checking for the pre-queue to start.

Coming from car knowledge, larger rad does not mean lower temperatures, it means sustaining low temperatures for longer (e.g. the 120mm would heat soak faster than a 360mm), but that can be resolved with a faster fan. So even though you have a 360mm rad on CPU, it won't cool it effectively when there is only so much contact area (big cold plate, but small and dense CPU die).  My friend is cooling his 3700X with a 120MM AIO just as well as I am cooling my 3700X with a 280MM AIO, only in sustained workloads his system might be a bit louder and a bit warmer. Plus the GPU core is in direct contact with the vapor chamber of the cooler, not going through an integrated heat spreader, which would lose some efficiency in heat transfer any time you are going from one material to another.",

The M2C uses a toolless snap system (you can barely see the snap-in points at the top) whereas the Meshify C uses 4 thumbscrews to secure the glass panel.\n* Mesh panel is slightly more offset in the front panel since the Meshify 2 Compact's mesh front panel is a door that swings open.\n* Feet are different, M2C is blocky like this whereas Meshify C has smaller silver round feet.\n* Screws holding the top panel on instead of just rivets, since the top panel is fully removable now.\n* No branding on the PSU shroud.\n* Cutout in the PSU shroud is now two segments so you can remove only part of it for radiator if you wish.\n\nLooks very much the same but these little differences speak to how much thought was put into redesign work for this series.

If you're trying to fill a bucket once a minute, doing so from a single faucet will require you to turn it up so high that a bunch of water splashes out.

    "title": "WOOO! Just achieved the second highest 6900xt port royal score in the world!",
    "selftext": "After the latest driver update I was finally able to push my 6900xt to the second highest port royal score in the world! Feels pretty good an I am extremely happy with the overclocking potential of rdna 2 especially if we are ever able to increase the voltage limit.\n\n[https://www.3dmark.com/search#advanced?test=pr%20P&cpuId=&gpuId=1353&gpuCount=0&deviceType=ALL&memoryChannels=0&country=&scoreType=overallScore&hofMode=false&showInvalidResults=false&freeParams=&minGpuCoreClock=&maxGpuCoreClock=&minGpuMemClock=&maxGpuMemClock=&minCpuClock=&maxCpuClock=](https://www.3dmark.com/search#advanced?test=pr%20P&cpuId=&gpuId=1353&gpuCount=0&deviceType=ALL&memoryChannels=0&country=&scoreType=overallScore&hofMode=false&showInvalidResults=false&freeParams=&minGpuCoreClock=&maxGpuCoreClock=&minGpuMemClock=&maxGpuMemClock=&minCpuClock=&maxCpuClock=)\n\nFor reference my build is\n\n\\-Reference 6900xt with ekwb custom loop\n\n\\-5950x on same loop\n\n\\-g.skills trident z 16 gb 4000 downclocked and tightened to 3600 cl14\n\n\\-2tb Samsung 970 evo\n\n\\-Gpu stats, 2740-2840 boost set, 1175mv, power limit increased to 365w max +15%, mem at 2124mhz fast timings.\n\nTo be clear I don't use those settings 24/7 I drop to 2700-2800 clocks and maintain around 2730mhz sustained 100%load in games, power draw around 330w. Still really happy with the score and hoping in the future we can get custom bios options to increase further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - just to give everyone some more info, I made a post a while ago about my initial findings with overclocking the 6900xt. Those all pretty much stay true today. Basically if you have good cooling, maxing the voltage to 1175mv (which is what it runs stock btw), and upping your power limit by at least 50w or more through morepower tool should let almost every 6900xt perform about the same as me give or take. If you are power limited (like all stock cards) and you don't want to mess with morepowertool, then an undervolt will give you great results. and if you are thermally limited I'd do undervolt as well. You can see my post here with more details. There is a HUGE misconception that an undervolt with these cards is the end all be all. That is only the case if thermally or power throttled. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/kw0hos/some\\_info\\_learned\\_from\\_6900xt\\_overclocking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/kw0hos/some_info_learned_from_6900xt_overclocking/)\n\nAlso a ton of people probably have an undervolt setting in place and don't even realize that it's not being used. The radeon software, or powerplay tables seem to do whatever the hell they want if they don't like what you put in. If you have say a undervolt to 1080mv it might not even be applied. To test this simply boot up your undervolt profile. download a program called gpu-z, most of you probably have that already. Launch your game or benchmark of choice that stresses the gpu 100% (this is very important). And then while it is running, launch gpu-z and navigate to the sensors tab, if it reads 1175mv for the gpu core your undervolt settings are being ignored.\n\nPlease be warned though, morepowertool goes past the power limits from amd and if you mess something up it can kill your card. I haven't heard of this happening yet, and it certainly hasn't happened to me but it is a possibility. Know the risk. The chances of it are very small I'd wager since amd tends to over engineer the boards a little but keep it in mind. ",

      "Damn a lot of negativity in the comments.\n\nCongrats OP that's super cool! I got mine in the top 9% on air and called it a day haha. Should try again with the new driver.\n\nI really love this card from a pure hardware standpoint. I can't justify using it over my 3090 right now without a DLSS alternative but I very much prefer the 6900XT as a GPU. way less heat output, and OCing is fairly straight forward and rewarding, while for the 3090 wattage gets out of hand really quickly (I'm a SFF enthusiast).\n\nDo you by any chance have game benchmarks of your card as well? Shadow of the tomb raider for example.",

I totally get why some would be frustrated and maybe take my post as a way to brag(which it's not lol). I was just really happy with my luck and excited that amd is once again at the forefront with gpus. The results you can get on rdna 2 from overclocking remind me of the golden overclocking days 10 years ago. Congrats on getting both of your cards as well!\n\nEdit- also I don't own shadow of the tombraider, which I would be very interested in benchmarking since I know that game typically sees amd far in the lead. I could run through ac valhalla, cyberpunk, and a few others if it's really of interest to people.",

      "I don't really understand your comment. Amd cpu's are now legitimately better than intel in every use case, hence the higher price now. They have also been killing intel in market share. If you are referring to the scores in port royal. 1. it's a raytracing benchmark and NVidia is way better at that, and 2. cpu really makes almost no difference in this test minus maybe a few percentage points since it's a gpu only benchamrk.",

      "Hopefully the rumors are true and stock will start to stabilize over the next few months. But then again we've heard that one before...",
      "I know I can't compete with NVidia when it comes to raytracing but I just wanted to share my excitement from just how much I was able to push out of my card. Before I put a custom loop on it and upped the power, my reference 6900xt was around a score of 9500 in port royal. So it has improved a huge amount. \n\nCongrats on the 3090 btw, that's an amazing card as well.",
      "I wrote \"in the world\" because that's exactly what it is. The second best 6900xt score \"in the world\". I mentioned nothing about any other cards.",

      "Its quite telling they are not comparing it to the regular 6600XT, 6700XT and 6900XT because the uplift is probably 5% at most and would make the price incease compared to the models that launched over a year ago comical.\n\nWe're probably in for a trashing in the reviews once the embargo lifts in a few hours.",

      "7xxx series will probably be positioned way higher performance-wise and price-wise. Only the 6950XT is probably in the same performance tier as N33, but others are higher.",
      "The pricing is likely reflective of what AMD views at the least medium term outlook for GPU pricing to be and they have much more data than consumers/media/etc. to work with. The rumored pricing of Intel's roughly 3060 competitor being $380 also supports similar predictions.\n\nThis means it seems like they feel that the RTX 3060 will likely stall around the $400 mark as opposed to falling down to MSRP range in the low $300s. Likewise the 3060ti will remain around the $500 mark versus falling down to the low $400s. In other words the overall downward price trend for GPUs has reached a stall point.",

      "I'll be short with you, 700 watts is probably enough for this GPU in some circumstances, but if you want this GPU to hit it's full potential in games, you're running a pretty high end CPU. 700 watts probably isn't enough and AMD recommends higher than 700 watts for a reason.",
      "700 still ain't enough for this card, I have a system with a 5800x and a 6900xt that pulls down 670 Watts in some situations.\n\nOh and it's a card with no overclocks, 700 isn't enough and you don't own the card to advise on this, I do.",
      "....Except a PSU is nowhere near the RRP of a 6900XT and they're directly related?\n\n\nIt's the same exact analogy as saying if you can't afford to maintain a vehicle, you can't afford the vehicle.",
      "I think the 6900xt is a lot more efficient than the 3090.",
      "What do you mean 'nope' lmao, even retail a 6900XT is $1000USD, a quality PSU is <$150.\n\n\nRegion and finances do not matter because power supplies are cheap relative to a literal top of the line GPU - hence why your argument is nonsense.\n\n\nIt's like buying a car that calls for premium fuel and putting lower grade fuel in it because you can't afford it lol, it makes absolutely zero sense.",
      "Okay so lots of replies here aren't going into _why_ the PSU is bad. \n\nThere are two reasons: (1) Brand and quality of components (2) The White rating is very low\n\nQuality of components means a lot more on a PSU than it does, say, a motherboard (though tbf it matters there too, the results just won't be as catastrophic). A PSU with low quality components can perform to _specifications_ (ie can it supply 700W peak) but the average capacity (RMS) will not be anywhere close to that. Which brings me to the White rating\n\nThe ratings of a PSU tell you how efficient the power supply is input vs. output. A higher efficiency (among other things) means less of your input power is wasted as heat. So if you have a super low efficiency PSU, your 800W at the load looks a lot more like 925W at the wall. Taking this (very oversimplification, apologies to any EE who reads this) toy example, we can estimate that 20% of the load (125W) is expelled as heat, resulting in 80% efficiency (the 80+ part). 125W of heat is more heat than your CPU TDP, and the PSU doesn't even have an AIO to keep it cool. So what happens when the PSU starts to get too hot? One of two things:\n\n1. The voltage is what it is and may droop a bit, but the current may be limited at the PSU causing a cascade of components to summarily reduce their performance because they can't draw enough power without reducing their own voltage. This could result in slowdowns or (more likely) hard resets if it happens very fast. \n\n2. The PSU components (being the above brand, this is likely) will fail and either (1) send a voltage spike through your system frying your $2k GPU/mobo, etc. or (2) melt and cause a short (shutting everything down), hopefully before reaching the flash point of any component at the short point and igniting something (or both of these could happen). \n\nMoral of the story, as others have said, if you have this GPU that's awesome, in this climate I'm sure you earned it. But please wait to put it in your system until you can get a better PSU. Patience may save you both money and your dwelling.",
      "Does this \"simple research\" include looking at the website for the actual card itself? Because if it does you need to take a look at your reading comprehension skills. Sapphire recommends an 850W PSU as a minimum. Could you theoretically run it on a 700W PSU, probably, if you use a low power CPU. Should you? Absolutely not, because your options are a) reduced performance/random shutdowns from lack of power, or b) reduced performance due to CPU bottleneck.",
      "Honestly, it probably could with a 65W TDP processor, but if you go all out on a GPU **don't cheap out on the PSU**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBTW, spending money on a bigger & better PSU is not a waste, rumors suggest crazy TDP numbers for new GPU's next year, you would need an upgrade anyway.",
      "If anyone thinks that running a PSU at its limit in the long term is a good idea for either the PSU or the expensive components that are plugged into it, then they do not know enough.\n\nEdit: Especially with an 80+ white rating",
      "You are a giant doucher, no doubt about that.",
      "How's this for your logic - if OP can afford that GPU but can't afford a PSU to run it properly then wtf is the point of buying that GPU in the 1st place.\n\nExactly..."

That could very well be different on the 40 series but I see no point in following ray tracing till it's more of a standard in games other than triple A titles. I noticed the difference in say Minecraft but that's really just Minecraft getting an update to old visuals. I play loads of single player titles and in every one of them ray tracing was a gimmick for a few things that just tanks fps. \n\nI'm pretty happy with my 6950xt but I also still have my 3070ti if I ever get the itch to stream, record, or play Minecraft with RT on.

Running around in RT overdrive at 80-90 fps in CP77 on a 4070 is something nothing from AMD can do (even if they get an FSR3 frame doubler the base RT performance isn't there on a 7900XTX. Maybe RDNA4 will get it right.)\n\nIt's a great experience for single player narrative driven stuff.",

Period. Now it's dropped down to $750ish range headed towards $700ish and leaves little room for a 7800XT. Would not expect anything different from the AMD Radeon team tough. It's no wonder they took ATI's near 50% market share in this segment and pretty much nearly lost it all.",

Except 3090 has twice as much VRAM and actually performs better in games (it also outperforms 6950XT).\n\nPersonally I **really** don't see a point of spending 600+ USD on a 12GB VRAM card that also happens to be the weakest xx70 in a looong while (compared to full sized dies). This thing is gonna be dead within a generation so there's no difference between it and outright buying a used card.\n\nIf it has to be AMD - there are thousands of 6900XTs on ebay often sold at below $500.

It´s the same with ALL the OCSUPERPOWER cards, no matter which brand. \n\nIn that test, alone the fact that the spikes in power consumption are similar to a stock version shows me even a stock card is capable of drawing a lot of power if you let it. (for example, by raising the power limit in the driver...)  Yes, the asrocks components might be of higher quality, yes, the power delivery might be more stable in long term. but TWICE the price?

I mean, 100% fan speed is nice but you would be going deaf with some fans and cooler designs if your pc were next to you on your desk. For AMD, Powercolor seems to do well together with MSI and Gigabyte, but it differs per 6700, 6800 and 6900, obviously.",

You pay a (substantial) premium to get something OEM validated at those higher clocks with cooling designed to handle it. Is that worth the price? Well, if that's the question you're asking, then it's not an option aimed at you.",

      "Stock power draw of 390w? ASRock basically set MPT for you, lol.",
      "Not a fan of the design nor the cooling solution on this card but the performance is impressive regardless. Too bad it will probably sound like a jet engine.",
      "It comes down to binning, the chips in these cards are the higher quality ones. In a lot of reviews and benchmarks the higher end cards are able to overclock higher than reference chips.",
      "Yeah, once you have read one review of a GPU you have basically read them all anyway. It's all mostly minor differences between all the versions and performance is fundamentally within the same ball park.",
      "It might seem counter intuitive, but waterblocks can lead to some surface components getting hotter than heatsinks since no air is flowing over the PCB.  Those components aren't usually super temperature sensitive, but I remember in the days of old when the first GPU water cooling efforts resulted in dead GPUs despite low temperature readings.  Modern blocks will make contact with everything that needs cooling and often will couple to the coils to act as another means for the PCB to shed heat.",

      "As big as RT is, it's not just RT.\n\nIt's also:\n\n* Tensor AKA Matrix accelerators (DLSS/DLDSR) - Not present on any current or even future announced AMD hardware, but a core part of Nvidia's Turing/Ampere/Lovelace architectures and Intel's Xe. Clearly the future of GPU's and already shockingly good.\n\n* DSR - Far inferior integration in AMD driver and perhaps hardware.\n\n* NVENC + related video capture API's (Nvidia paid developers to help the OBS team and other developers integrate these API's, AMD doesn't have the API nor the employees)\n\n* Reflex - Not present in AMD software, requires driver and game engine integration. Nvidia identified the need for the tech with a community member, created it, has a bunch of developers assigned to help companies integrate it into their games and engines and now it's in IIRC 8 of the top 10 FPS games and several of the most popular open game engines like Unreal.\n\n* Proper adaptive sync (incl. features like variable overdrive) - Hardware not present, essential for good VRR yet brushed under the rug because it makes them look bad. Third party reviews or Nvidia branding are the only reliable ways to know that your VRR display which VRR's with an AMD GPU will work even half decently.\n\n* OpenGL/DX9/DX11 api performance - been hammering them for this since the 7970 was the shiny new toy, it never happened. This matters to many people who play games like Minecraft, OSRS or generally older games. People are still upgrading their gtx970's to 6900xt's, losing 30-50% of their FPS and asking me why it happened.\n\n* Product support duration. AMD has recently rebadged old architectures as current gen over and over and over again, then dropped support for features that they could run perfectly while they were still being sold as new for no reason other than not having any employees to write the code.\n\nMost people care about at least one of those things, personally i use them all every week and most of them every day. More than a few are nothing short of revolutionary.\n\nIf they want to charge Nvidia pricing they need Nvidia performance, feature set and driver team. If you don't have parity, then every loss needs to be met with an equally sized win (which just doesn't exist) or with a discount. If their hardware was massively cheaper than Nvidia's for a given raster performance then i would recommend them carefully to a few people who don't care about these features, but that hasn't happened in a very long time and the list of people who don't care about any is getting smaller by the day.",

It's one of those things they literally did a study and almost nobody could notice! The DLSS makes a bit more sense especially if you are trying to push super high frames, but AMD looks to be evening the playing field with FSR 2.0, so to me it's almost a wash at this point.",

Long overdue, the day has finally come—an AMD graphics card is able to overtake NVIDIA's current-generation flagship graphics card! Who would have thought that just a year ago. This makes the ASRock RX 6900 XT OC Formula 7% faster than the AMD reference RX 6900 XT, 12% faster than the GeForce RTX 3080, and 13% faster than the RX 6800 XT. Very impressive numbers. There are still some RTX 3090 custom designs, like the ASUS STRIX and MSI Suprim, that are yet a little bit faster than the OC Formula.\"",
      "Absolutely, again I never thought in a million years I'd even consider a 1k GPU, but when I started doing the math and price shopping (and waiting in the queue) I decided it likely made the most sense to try and get a 6900xt.\n\nAnd to your point, for some crazy reason I have actually seen 6800xt's sell for more than 6900xt's in second hand markets, and considering I purchased a reference one barely used, for the cost of a new one with tax and shipping, it kinda proved my point.\n\nBut yes, the pricing is fucked and my concern is what the next gen of GPU's will be priced at. HOWEVER, I'm hoping there are either changes in ethereum or crypto in general that make the next gen less desirable, OR when they upgrade they flood the market with used 3090's and 6800's at ridiculously low prices in the next year. That could also force manufacturers to lower prices too once the miners get their fill. In late 2019 if you were patient you could find a Vega 64 for under 200 bucks, or a Radeon Vega FE for under 400, we will see that again.\n\nAnd for people worried about buying second hand, linus tech tips did a great video on how used GPU's rarely if ever under perform over their new variants. Especially the higher binned models as well!",

      "I think the prices are going to fall like stones when they finally are able to ramp up production.  I wanted a 6800 XT myself and waited a year for it--but finally settled on a 6700 XT (GB Eagle 6700 XT 12GB) when the NewEgg price dropped to where I thought the real non-shortages MSRP of an AIB card with a triple fan would be...about $100-$125 over AMD store reference design pricing--so I grabbed it.\n\nIt was kind of interesting that while I was completing the order, the Newegg stats said that there were 200 other people with the same GPU in their carts!  I can understand, since the price had dropped suddenly by almost $300.  Went back a couple of days ago and darned if the Newegg price of the same GPU hadn't been raised again another $200 over what I paid...;)  NewEgg must have received a big load of the Eagles and they priced them to sell quickly, which they did.  So, production is still not back to normal, unfortunately.  Let's hope things get back to normal soon.\n\nAnyway, I'm well pleased with this product!  GPU beats my 5700 XT at 4k convincingly, by up to 30-35% in most of my games!  And the image quality has definitely improved.  So, I'm pat on a GPU for a good while.  Next, I'll be looking at the 5700X/5800X or the 5800X-3dVcache!  I've got almost three years on my x570 Aorus Master and I can't see why it won't last another year or two...;)",
      "Those aren't at all close to the same concept. A 6900 XT is much more accessible than a Viper, which many theoretical buyers would have a disastrous time trying to drive. It's also much more bespoke (versus more mainstream Dodge vehicles of the time) than a 6900 XT. A 6800 XT is much closer to a 6900 XT than a Challenger is to a Viper.\n\nYou'd have a better chance at comparing AMD CPUs, putting a Ryzen 5 against a Threadripper Pro.",
      "It just depends on how important RT is to you, to be honest. Totally respect whatever decision people make, I run both AMD and Nvidia, and in many cases the 6900 can push as many frames as a 3090, there are cases where it outperforms because the 3090 has RT cores, whereas if you don't run RT, the 6900 has more dedicated cores meaning it can technically out perform a 3090 in certain use cases and especially if you're trying to push high frames.\n\nWith that said, buy what you want, and what makes you happy, makes no difference to me. JUST AVOID THE FUCK OUTTA SCALPERS AND SITES WITH TERRIBLE MSRP MARKUP!!!!!",

      "Odd. I started a game just to remind myself what my temps are like on my 240 rad - 1440p 60Hz running a 3D scene in War Thunder it spikes to 60 before the fans turn on but then holds at 49 with low fan RPM. At medium load (1440p Ultra 165Hz) it likes to hover around 53 and has never exceeded 61. PBO + 85 degree limit, OS power management features disabled.\n\nIf it's fine under load who cares I suppose. The mounting frames are a gimmick when it comes to AM5, although I belive they're valid for some Intel sockets.",
      "I have the same case and CPU, but with a 7900xtx. It breathes just fine. It has fans directly blowing into it. \n\nThe cpu gets a bit less coolong than normal, but this is fine since the wattage is so low on that chip. No issues what so ever. I think I use a NH-L12S or something similar.\n\nFor larger cards, like the 4080 or 4090, the fans for the gpu is removed to make space. In this case it is not a problem also, since it basicly is an open rig with no filter. Air is pulled right through.",

Inflation, shortages, R&D costs for the process technology, etc etc. People need to stop buying them at inflated prices in order for the prices to drop, and you cannot get enough people on board with that for that the happen.

If AMD ships the XTXH chip for all 6950 XTs it wouldn't be horrible since the premium Navi 21 cards are already more expensive than this.\n\n6750 XT at $549 is BAD, really really bad. %15 price pump would only be justified by a 15% or more increase in performance, which is highly unlikely by only adding faster memory and high clocks without core count change. At this price, the card is approaching the current 3060 Ti market price, the 6700 XT competitor. NVIDIA's feature set is superior and makes a 6750 XT at the same price look very dumb.\n\n6650 XT at $399 is fine I guess.

They thus use last-gen parts to service the lower-end market segments for 6-12 months. Recent examples include:\n\n* Ryzen 3000 desktop (Ryzen 2000 was lower-end))\n* Ryzen 5000 desktop (Ryzen 3000 was lower-end)\n* Ryzen 5000U (Zen 2 based APUs were lower-end, not Zen 3)\n* Ryzen 6000U (Zen 3 based APUs were lower-end, not Zen 3+)\n* Threadripper 3000 (TR 2000 and the 3950X were lower-end)\n* Radeon RX Vega series (RX 500 series was lower-end)\n* Radeon RX 5000 series (this didn't even have a top-end, and Vega and RX 500 filled in the gap until the 5600/5500 series)\n* Radeon RX 6000 series (gaps filled by RX 5000, Vega and RX 500, until the 6600 / 6500 XT launched)\n\nAMD aren't Intel; they have about a quarter of the manufacturing capacity, so aren't in a position to flood the market with SKUs top to bottom. AMD have, in fact, not done a top-to-bottom SKU launch on desktop within a launch window since maybe 2010 for CPUs (Phenom II) and 2015 for GPUs (RX 300 series). Every other launch since has either been top-heavy (e.g. Threadripper 3000) or bottom-heavy with no real flagship that can compete against Intel (e.g. 1800X and 2700X were still far slower than the i7-7700K and i7-8700K in gaming).\n\nExpect AMD's late 2022 GPU product stack to look something like this:\n\n* Titan-class prosumer card: \"Rage Fury RX Turbo\" with 2.5x the performance of the 6950 XT\n* Ultra-enthusiast: \"7990 XT\" - 2.2x the 6950 XT\n* High-end enthusiast: \"7900 XT\" - 2.0x the 6950 XT\n* Enthusiast: \"7900\" - 1.7x the 6950 XT\n* Lower enthusiast: \"7800 XT\" - 1.5x the 6950 XT\n* Upper mid: \"7800\" - 1.2x the 6950 XT\n* Mid-range: no 7700 XT at launch, just a cut-down 6950 XT\n* Lower-mid: no 7600 XT at launch, just the 6750 XT\n\nProblem is, all SKU tiers will move up in price. I'd expect the 6750 XT, for example, to be far more expensive than the 6600 XT despite filling the same relative performance tier.",
      "new gen every 2 years\\~ish?",
      "Demand is still very high for these parts, new parts are a way off (six months or more), and releasing a very slightly updated existing product doesn’t detract from anything upcoming. It’s really just ordering different memory chips.",
      "Tsmc have a certain manufacturing capacity agreed with amd. That capacity needs to be met at all times for both companies profits and future business. Rdna3 may not have been in manufacturing when these refreshes began to be made. Stopgap cards like these arent just to fill a small hole in the market but a small hole in manufacturing capacity too",
      "What are the \"7000 is around the corner\"expectations that I see in comments based on?",
      "*excuse to raise msrps",
      "Around the corner probably means at the end of the year; October or later. Plenty of demand to fill in the meantime.",
      "They are only refreshing the highest SKUs of Navi 21,22 and 23. \n\n6800XT is a cutdown Navi 21.",
      "I don't see the point.  How much extra fps does 2 more gbps give?  My 6900 xt toxic LE is already 18 gbs.\n\nEdit:  That good silicon could be put to use on next gen or bettering the 6500 xt.",
      "5nm process, MCM, refinement of the architecture (RDNA3 is a bigger departure from its predecessor than RDNA2 was). Major improvement to perf/watt once again.\n\nThe 6900XT is a less than 300W card. Efficiency improvements brought by the process and the architectural changes could bring it down to 200-225W. Put two of them together thanks to MCM, and you're at 400-450W, for 2x the perf. And finally add the RDNA3 improvements and you get a 2.2x or so monster of a GPU. Really not inconceivable, it's just that years of +5% yearly by intel and +30% every couple years by Nvidia made us believe we had reached some sort of wall. That was never the case, the issue was always the lack of incentive for any of these companies to really push the envelope. Now we have AMD delivering on both CPU and GPU sides and look, intel just dropped one of the biggest performance leap in CPU perf of the past 5 years. Of course that wasn't just because of AMD, these architectures take many years to develop but it's no coincidence such a big perf jump happens when they have to defend their marketshare.\n\nNvidia Lovelace is also rumored to be a giant leap (but not quite to the level of RDNA3 because of the lack of MCM)",
      "The 6900xt is pretty much a 6800xt with faster clocks so it makes sense why there isn’t",
      "Navi 31 is projected to be 2-2.5x the performance of the 6900 XT. There's no way the 7900 XT will be $1000 (the same MSRP as the 6900 XT) unless the 7900 XT is only about 1.2x the performance of the 6900 XT.\n\nBeing realistic, the actual 7900 XT will be about $2000. 2.5x the performance, for 2x the price...",
      "This new trend of excusing price gouging with \"performance gains\" is the worst thing MLD unleashed on the technosphere. 😩 If we normalize this, all tech products will forever increase in price, which is the reverse of how it has been historically.",
      "It's working for Nvidia with the 12GB 3080, 3080ti, 3070ti, and rumoured 3090ti.",
      "I have no such crashes with a 6800 xt. Their drivers have been solid, maybe try a clean install of them using DDU to remove the old.",
      "7900XT is enough for me, $999 only plz thanks. They have prosumer to take the higher brackets now, leave the $999 bracket for the 7900XT to pair with a Zen 4 7800X for maximum gaming."

Usually it's something like 0C - 40C.\n\nThese devices can work at lower temperatures but there's no guarantee they won't break. \n\nAs for the sealing, miner could clean cards in some sus way (with water), and re-seal them. Not exactly unheard or impossible thing.\n\nThe fact that all those cards don't have official warranty and didn't came from official distributor sorta confirms it.\n\nBasically KrisFix got all those cards in the first place, because they don't have official warranty.",

I mean this (driver hysteria), plus derbauer's explosive GPU, along with \"estimations\" on defective cards, plus an endless supply of vague comments from recently created users saying AMD cards just \"weren't for them\" or whatever. It's too much too close together.\n\nAnd this is not in any way a defense of the Navi31 launch which was clearly messed up. This is pointing out that there have been an unusually high number of manufactured controversies with no data whatsoever designed to discourage consumers from purchasing AMD cards. Also, last disclaimer, I've been using Nvidia cards for about a decade until last month, so no attempts to point out bias please.",
