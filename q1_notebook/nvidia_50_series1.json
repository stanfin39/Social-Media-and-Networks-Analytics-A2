Selecting an ASUS GeForce RTX 5060 Ti or 5060 card means that you'll get a card built to last with the following features:\n\n* **Axial-tech fans with dual-ball bearings -** Each card features Axial-tech fans with dual-ball bearings, which increase airflow above standard fans through the use of longer fan blades; dual-ball bearings keep the fans quiet and provide long-term reliability compared to sleeve bearing fans\n* **Vented Aluminum backplates -** Each ASUS GeForce RTX 5060 Ti and 5060 includes a vented aluminum backplate for structural support and to further increase heat dissipation.\n* **0dB Technology -** Cooling fans will intelligently shut off when not needed keeping the card quiet in low-load situations\n* **Dual-BIOS with Performance and Quiet Fan Curves -** With a quick restart of your machine, you can set your graphics card to prioritize low temperatures for muscular performance, or to prioritize low noise levels for distraction-free gaming.\n* **ASUS GPU Guard -** GPU Guard places adhesive in each corner of the GPU socket to help prevent crack damage that can occur over time\n* **ASUS Auto-Extreme Technology -** During manufacturing, automated soldering is done in a single-pass to reduce manufacturing strain to help boost integrity and higher reliability, as well as avoiding the use of harsh cleaning chemicals\n* **GPU Tweak III Software -** GPU Tweak III gives you control over your GPU, memory, and fan control. With the HWiNFO plugin included, you can monitor the rest of your system on the desktop or in the OSD. GPU Tweak III also features a new OSD wizard for even more control over how the OSD looks on your screen.\n\n# TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB, RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, and RTX 5060 Graphics Cards\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sfjfo3dqu6ve1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=352dcadc03a23e242b9c5dfe561823948fc7f48d\n\nASUS offers the TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB, TUF Gaming RTX 5060 Ti 8GB and TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5060 8GB to satisfy those who want the ultimate in rugged and reliable hardware.

Which ASUS GeForce RTX 5060 Ti models will be available?**  \nA. With the information I currently have, these models should be available Day 1 or close to it (see the disclaimer in the next question):\n\n* TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB OC\n* ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB OC\n* ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB\n* ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB\n* ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB OC\n\n**Q. Where will ASUS GeForce 5060 Ti cards be available?**  \nA. I'll provide what I can share below, but I've been told that some product is still in transit to certain stores so it's possible that these locations will have them up for sale a bit later. I don't yet have complete model-by-model details yet, so I'll list the general availability that I have. If you're looking where to find a specific model, please look for the Availability section under the model above.\n\n* US - ASUS eShop, Newegg, Amazon, Micro Center, B&H, and Best Buy\n* CA - Canada Computers, Memory Express, and Best Buy (CA)\n\n**Q. Will these all be available on Day 1 as listed?**  \nA. We expect that most, if not all of these will be available at 6am PST for the US. Of course, things happen sometimes and a particular etailer or retailer may have a website issue or may be pending for stock to reach them. Feel free to ask later in the day and we can track this down.\n\n**Q. What about Canada Day 1 sales?**  \nA. For Canada, I do not have confirmation on which stores will have Day 1 stock at this time, unfortunately. If I receive confirmation before the end of the day I will update it.\n\n**Q. I've watched the other launches and never saw \\[insert model\\] go in stock! When will we see \\[insert model\\]?**  \nA. Many of these products are sold out in seconds, so it's very likely that you may not see it go in stock at your preferred place of purchase. As noted above, some products may still be in transit.\n\nWith that said, you can always check with me in the comments below if they went in stock at a particular location, but so far if they've been expected to go live, they have.\n\n**Q. Will there be pre-orders?**  \nA. Not with this launch. If this changes, we'll provide an update.\n\n**Q. Quick! What are the dimensions of the cards?**  \nA. Here you are -\n\nTUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti / 5060 -\n\n* Metric: 302 x 140 x 62 mm\n* Imperial: 11.89 x 5.51 x 2.44 inch\n* Slot Size: 3.1 Slots\n\nASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti –\n\n* Metric: 304 x 120 x 50 mm\n* Imperial: 11.97 x 4.72 x 2 inch\n* Slot Size: 2.5 Slot\n\nASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 –\n\n* Metric: 268.3 x 120 x 50 mm\n* Imperial: 10.56 x 4.72 x 2 inch\n* Slot Size: 2.5 Slot\n\nASUS Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti –\n\n* Metric: 229 x 120 x 50 mm\n* Imperial: 9.02 x 4.72 x 2 inch\n* Slot Size: 2.5 Slot\n\nASUS Dual GeForce RTX 5060 –\n\n* Metric: 228 x 123 x 50 mm\n* Imperial: 8.98 x 4.84 x 2 inch\n* Slot Size: 2.5 Slot\n\nHopefully this covers some or all of the questions you might have about the launch. I'll add more if anyone has a good question or a point that needs to be clarified.\n\n  \nEdit: Pricing added and accurate as of 4/16.",

      "Why does the Prime have baby fans when the other models don't?  I don't think I've seen those on any other 50 series card.",
      "The 5060 TI 16GB is below MSRP?",
      "no LP model?",
      "Is there any ETA or price info available for the Tuf 5070 Ti BTF White? I know it was announced not long ago too, but I can only find info on the 5060 cards. I already have the matching BTF board on pre-order, so any info would help.",
      "Two reasons. First, there is a matter of perspective. The TUF Gaming is physically larger (35mm longer and 20mm taller) and the Dual only uses two fans, so a larger fan can be used in those instances. Also contributing to the optical difference in fan size is that the ratio of fan hub to blade length is slightly different. The Prime has a smaller hub and longer fan blades to compensate. \n\nThe other reason it's different is because the Prime GeForce RTX 5060 cards are 40mm shorter than even its 5060 Ti cousin, limiting the space to include three fans. That's probably the biggest reason it looks strange to you.",

Even setting aside the impact on 1% lows (which are as awful as you expected), the impact VRAM has on average FPS is surprising.\n\nThis is a card that has the exact same amount of compute as its 16GB equivalent, and yet in some games it behaves like it has 20% fewer CUDA cores. In other words, it already has worse average performance, and that’s **before** you have to deal with VRAM stutters.\n\nDespite the headlines and clickbait, the thesis is still sound: **do not buy the 8GB model**, especially if you enable all the RTX features like Nvidia really wants you to.",

You can clearly see a lot of people on Steam have GPUs that have 8GB or even less of VRAM.  It does appear a lot of people do have 12GB cards too.  So 8-12GB is where we are...

      "All the 5000 cards OC great.\n\nThe 5060TI is just the one that's most memory constrained since compute ability went up but it has the same total memory bandwidth as the 3060TI.\n\nBut you can take a 5070 and do +3000 Mem clock easily.\n\nThe biggest issue is Ampere haunts the 5060TI specifically.  It's [only 30% faster than the 3060TI](https://youtu.be/Cskegn1-D7s?si=og6BPP9dGRhnphf_&t=746) at stock.\n\nWhile it has its own future-proofing concerns, the 5070FE is more of a generational leap.",
      "Just so you know when you say 66% less vram you're saying that there 5080 has 16gb less vram than the 4090. Or 8gb.\n\n66% less equals 24x.66 = 16 \n\n24-16 = 8gb total vram.\n\nSo that's not correct. It's 33% less vram",
      "In relative terms this card OCs better than anything out of previous gen, so why not get a free 10-15% perf increase?",
      "Love that my 3070 is holding on in these charts haha",
      "I will not touch anything from Nvidia this generation \n\nthe worst ever generation that i've seen from Nvidia so far every 5000 series is a mess on its own",
      "Even without power increase you can probably still get most of that performance bump with just a core and memory of tbh",
      "That's embarrassing tbh",
      ">The 5060TI is just the one that's most memory constrained since compute ability went up but it has the same total memory bandwidth as the 3060TI.\n\n\nNo it's due to clockspeed the 5060ti has a very low max voltage at stock for some reason. While what u say about bandwidth compared to the 3060ti is true remember compared to the 4060ti, memory bandwidth went up by like 3x more than compute did.\n\nAlso the 3060ti had a good amount of bandwidth for it's compute as is and the l2 cache is 8x larger on the 5060ti. Don't get me wrong the 5060ti has in no way got a lot of bandwidth for its performance but most of the uplift from the 4060ti is already because of the bandwidth increase",
      "Yes we know the generational uplift for the 5 series is shit but coming from 3 series it’s a good uplift, I upgraded from 3080 TI FE I paid 1400euros for to 5080 FE which I paid 1138 euros for, it’s a great upgrade. I’m getting more perf, less power consumption and less heat",
      "Well, maybe they can ask GAssist to help them do it easily.",
      "Its just a synthetic. In real world scenario is more of a circa 10% increase.",
      "It doesn’t match 4070 even when OC’ed to max. It is by all means a disappointing card.",
      "i jumped on the 5080 train yesterday (from a base level 3080)\n\nWas it necessary? Not totally, but now I'm set for another 5 years or so. Microcenter had a \"huge resupply\" they claimed. \n\nOddly enough I show up at 10am yesterday and there's already a line,  I had NO idea it was the same day the 5060ti was being sold. \n\nAlso had the absolute joy of being behind a morbidly obese kid that hadn't showered in a week. People are F'n nasty.",
      "you're comparing it to the 4060ti, one of the worst GPUs ever. Try the 3070 which as you can see has the same perf and was launched 4.5 yrs ago lmao",
      "Yup still insane though if you ask me.",
      "It’s 15% faster than 4060 Ti. That’s still 10-15% slower than 4070. Sure it’s 4% cheaper than 4060 Ti but that’s MSRP, which it will never retail for anyways. 60 Ti used to match or beat last gen 80 series card. Sure , keep taking whatever NVIDIA gives you. Don’t ask them to do better.\n\n780 and 980 were on the same node as well. TSMC 28nm node. Yet 980 was 40% faster than 780. You can check tech power up for source if you don’t believe me. Stop defending a multi trillion dollar corporation..",
      "Why? 4070 Super succeeded 4070. It makes more sense to compare it with 5070. You could have had same perf and VRAM of 5070 a year ago. You call this generational uplift?\n\nEven if we do what you say, it’s till only 15% faster than 4070. Which is bad. Don’t tell me you think 15% gen on gen uplift is good."

I will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links. This will be sorted alphabetically.\n\n# Written Articles\n\n# [Babeltechreviews](https://babeltechreviews.com/rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review/)\n\n>The **Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti** is a competent midrange GPU that brings incremental improvements over its predecessor, especially when leveraging **DLSS 4**. It performs well at **1080p and 1440p**, and offers solid gains if coming from a **30-series or older** card. Content creators also benefit from enhanced NVENC support for faster 4:2:2 video encoding. Its compact design, low power draw, and frame generation capabilities make it a practical choice for mainstream gamers and small form factor builds.\n\n>However, for a **new generation card**, the performance gains are modest—typically around **10–15% over the RTX 4060 Ti**—making it a hard sell unless priced at or below MSRP. If prices drift north of $449, **AMD’s RX 7700 XT or 7800 XT** become better buys with more VRAM and stronger raster performance. Ultimately, the RTX 5060 Ti is a **fine choice at the right price** but fails to impress as a major step forward. Wait for discounts or consider stepping up to an RTX 4070 Super or AMD 7800 XT if your budget allows.\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n\n# Digital Foundry Video\n\n>With our testing complete, the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is a tricky card to judge, given that its performance differentials can swing substantially based on the game and even game scene tested. \n\n>Based on *our* game selections though, the card is in the same territory as the RX 7800 XT, with an average 22 percent lead over the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB at 1440p. That's one of the biggest gen-on-gen gains that we've seen going from Ada Lovelace to Blackwell, but it's worth considering that the RTX 4060 Ti didn't really shift the needle when it came to beating its predecessor. \n\n>For those upgrading from prior cards in the same class, there's around a 37 percent increase over the RTX 3060 Ti from 2020. Meanwhile, versus the 2019 vintage RTX 2060 Super, you're getting double the performance. In both cases, the DLSS 4 feature set is appealing and I'd consider the RTX 5060 Ti a fine upgrade there. \n\n>Elsewhere, the RTX 5070 is significantly faster than the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB - to the tune of a mighty 38 percent. My results also see the RTX 4070 beat the RTX 5060 Ti by 11 percent, though overclocking can make up most of the difference in many games. \n\n>Based on the RTX 5060 Ti's overall performance, the card is solid enough but hardly spectacular - meaning that price comes into focus. Looking at dollars per frame based on MSRP, it's disappointing that the RTX 5070 offers better value - and I can't help but think there ought to have been a single 16GB or even 12GB model at $399. (Despite the 128-bit bus, 3GB memory modules do exist that would have unlocked 12GB as a potential option - though it's unclear whether they're available in the quantities and prices needed for a budget GPU.) \n\n>So as we keep saying, the RTX 5060 Ti is a bit tricky. The 8GB card on mixed benchmarks will provide better value than the 16GB version overall and compares more favourably to the RTX 5070. On the flipside, we just can't recommend the 8GB card given how often we're running into VRAM issues with many games, especially upon launch. \n\n>The 16GB version is the one to have then, but with the 5070 offering 35 to 43 percent better performance at \"only\" 28 percent more money, you're again funnelled towards the higher-priced offering - though $120 extra is a significant step up in this sector of the market. I just wish that Nvidia understood that value is supposed to increase the further down the stack you go - not decrease. \n\n>The PCIe situation is also not great, with the 5060 Ti's 8x lanes translating into some noticeable performance degradation on older PCIe 3.0 motherboards due to bandwidth limitations. While the majority of users will be using these cards with modern motherboards with PCIe 4.0 or 5.0 slots, these more budget-oriented cards are more likely to be used with similarly low-end or just antiquated motherboards compared to higher-end GPUs. Our testing shows up to a 20 percent performance drop in [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle](https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review) at 1080p, with less sizeable double-digit percentage drops in [F1 24](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-24) and single-digit percentage drops in [Black Myth: Wukong](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong). \n\n>Ultimately, there are question marks over value, but the RTX 5060 Ti is worth taking a look at. \n\n# [eTeknix Article](https://www.eteknix.com/asus-prime-oc-rtx-5060-ti-graphics-card-review/)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR5phLkePYA)\n\n>So, a bit of a tangent, but back on track. The 3060 Ti was a good card when it came out, but is definitely showing its age, and with the 5060 Ti sitting 29% ahead overall, there’s definitely a viable option to buy it, especially as 3060 Ti’s are still holding their price for some weird reason. The 4060 Ti however, sees the 5060 Ti around 19% faster and while, and I’m sure NVIDIA will be happy for me to say this, it has multi-frame generation upscaling which works some kind of voodoo magic, but people still aren’t sold on it, but the tide is turning somewhat.\n\n>If NVIDIA came in with a GPU that offered a 30% generation uplift or higher in rasterisation, and higher in raytracing gen on gen, plus MFG, then yes, I think it would be much better received, but that’s not the case, and instead, if you’re already on a 40 series card, I can’t say there’s an argument to upgrade to any 50 series, with maybe the exception being the RTX 5090, but that’s in a whole different league. Beyond that, people are looking for a reason to upgrade and I don’t know about you, but I’m getting a bit bored of saying things like “It’s good but…” or “You should buy it if you can get it for $X”. The argument is wearing a bit thin.\n\n>I will say that the 5060 Ti on paper, if you take pricing out of the equation, does come across as a good performer. It even sits ahead of the 3070 Ti, and that’s what we want to see. The other issue is AMD. At that price point, AMD are the better buy, but again, and I swear this will be the second to last time I say it, but AMD cards are inflated too, so I’ll leave you with one piece of advice, and it’s a big one.\n\n>Regardless, the 5060 Ti is good, but it feels like it’s much the same as we’ve seen with the rest of the stack. If the price is right, and you’re not already on a 40 series card, then there’s an argument, but if the price isn’t right and/or you’re already on a 40 series card, then maybe give this one a miss, unless MFG really tickles your fancy.\n\n>For now, that’s going to wrap up another 50 series GPU review. With a not-so-easy-to-understand conclusion, I’d like to think we’ve at least shown you the facts, and that you can make an educated decision as to what to do from there based on that all-important word. Price.\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review/)\n\n>The RTX 5060 Ti is built around a rasterizer shading engine and includes 4608 CUDA cores. It stems from the RTX 50 series, which introduces a new generation of Ray Tracing and Tensor cores positioned close to the shader engine. These RT cores never pause as they produce vivid lighting, shadow, and reflection effects. Although Tensor cores sometimes seem tricky to measure in terms of raw benefits, their influence becomes obvious when paired with DLSS3 and the updated DLSS4. The 50 series represents more than a mere upgrade; it stands as a leap forward that meets different gaming requirements. Whether someone is immersed in 2K (2560x1440) gaming or venturing into the realm of 4K (3840x2160), the RTX 5060 Ti adapts when you enable DLSS4/MFG. In baseline performance (depending on where and what you measure), expect reference cards to be \\~15% faster than the 4060 Ti, and OC models closing in at perhaps 20% for the fastest locked and configured models.\n\n>The RTX 5060 Ti steps onto the stage, immediately ingraining gamers with very decent frame rates. Sure, it might lag slightly behind some close competitors when it comes to standardized shading, but overall, the graphics performance is solid enough. What's interesting is that the improvement isn't uniform across all games. One title might skyrocket with huge frame rate gains, while another enjoys just a modest boost. But the real star of the show is NVIDIA’s heavy investment in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and neural shading technologies. Activate DLSS4 with frame generation set at 4x (if possible), and the difference is obvious right away—it feels like catching a glimpse of gaming’s future. Yet, there's a lingering question among gamers: Is the community ready to fully embrace these AI-powered enhancements? Technology evolves so quickly these days, and some players are hesitant to fully rely on machine learning to boost their gaming visuals and performance. However, early adopters aren't holding back; they're diving right in. As more players see what DLSS4 can achieve, particularly in new, visually demanding games, the excitement is sure to spread. There's no doubt about it—DLSS4 is impressive, and early performance data backs this up. Gamers using ultra-wide or 1440p monitors will especially appreciate how every pixel gets pushed to its limits. And those chasing ultimate 4K experiences will also find plenty to love. By combining the raw power of the RTX 5060 Ti with DLSS4's dynamic upscaling, games can now achieve frame rates that were once considered impossible. While some might label the RTX 5060 Ti as just a mainstream GPU, it’s actually much more versatile. It comfortably handles high-end AAA games without breaking a sweat, making it perfect for gamers who don't always need every setting maxed but still want smooth, impressive performance. Additionally, content creators and professionals using GPU-heavy tasks like video editing or 3D rendering will find the 5060 series quite capable. Its powerful CUDA cores speed up rendering, giving creators valuable extra time. Of course, true enthusiasts might already have their eyes set on the higher-end 5070 Ti or 5080 models, but the RTX 5060 Ti hits a better price point for most PC gamers\n\n>Priced around the $429 mark, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti seems promising enough. Whether it becomes your next favorite GPU depends on how expensive it'll sell once it hits the shelves. But overall it's a product series that we can recommend if you're coming from the RTX 3000 or equivalent graphics card era.\n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/msi-and-pny-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-review)\n\n>Like some of the other members of the [GeForce RTX 50 series](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-architecture-overview), the new GeForce RTX 5060 Ti offers a modest upgrade in rasterization performance over its previous-gen counterpart If we don't factor in newer technologies and DLSS 4 with multi frame generation, the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is about \\~20% faster than the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. For the millions of gamers still using lower-end or older \"xx60\" class cards, however, GeForce RTX 5060 Ti would be significant upgrade. Not only is the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti much faster than older cards for gaming, but it's got better display output support, a more capable media engine, and its power requirements are modest enough that most folks won't need a PSU upgrade either -- just stick with the 16GB version if you've got the budget. 8GB cards are going to be much more limited moving forward.\n\n>With an MSRP of $429, the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti's introductory price comes in a bit higher than 8GB GeForce RTX 4060 Ti cards, but below 16GB variants that were introduced later. Assuming gamers will be able to get their hands on GeForce RTX 5060 Tis for prices approaching MSRP, it represents a good value and a significant upgrade for gamers and creators still rocking RTX 30 series, or older, cards in the same class. As we've mentioned with the other GeForce RTX 50 series cards, the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is faster, more capable, and more power-efficient than its previous generation counterpart and anyone that likes tinker will have plenty of fun overclocking. Without leveraging DLSS 4’s multi frame generation, its generational performance uplift is smaller than what we’ve seen from NVIDIA in the past, though.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-in-test-economical-consumption-surprisingly-fast-but-not-with-8gb/)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB tested today marks the current entry of NVIDIA’s Blackwell architecture into the mid-range segment and takes on the established competition with the new GB206-300 chip. While the 8 GB version can hardly be meaningfully tested in modern scenarios due to the limited memory configuration, the 16 GB version is the focus of all meaningful analyses. The GPU is based on four 32-bit memory channels and uses the clamshell method to expand capacity, allowing a total of eight 2 GB GDDR7 modules to be used. Despite identical bandwidth to the 8 GB version of 448 GB/s at 28 Gbps memory clock, this results in improved suitability for memory-intensive applications, but without an increase in memory bandwidth.\n\n>The gaming performance of the RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB is convincing in current titles, especially when DLSS 4 and Frame Generation are activated. In a direct comparison with the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB, the new card is 23 percent ahead on average with AI functions enabled, and still around 17 to 18 percent ahead without factory overclocking. The strong increase in minimum frame rates (P1 Low) is remarkable, where up to 36 percent lead was measured. This leads to a significantly more stable gaming experience, especially at WQHD resolution. Efficiency has been noticeably improved, as performance is clearly higher with comparable power consumption. Under full gaming load, the average power consumption is between 155 and 165 watts, while the power limit of 180 watts is generally not exhausted. Even under extreme conditions, the card remains thermally and electrically stable.\n\n>My test with the MSI GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Gaming Trio showed that high-quality board partner designs can exploit the full potential of the GPU. The card comes with factory overclocking, which results in around 2 to 3 percent more performance than a reference card. The cooling design with four heatpipes, a solid copper block and a fin array with a high air flow rate ensures low GPU temperatures of around 63 °C in gaming mode. The memory modules remain below 68 °C, also thanks to the generous cooling through the backplate and via separate pads. Acoustically, the card remains very quiet at around 31 dB(A) under load, with only a minimal audible whirring of the coils. The power supply via a total of eight phases delivered stable voltage values, even with manual overclocking.\n\n>All in all, the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB can be characterized as a modern mid-range GPU, which is primarily aimed at users who do not want to do without the latest technologies such as DLSS 4, Reflex 2 and ray tracing, but do not want to spend 500 euros or more on a graphics card. With an RRP of 429 US dollars, the card is significantly lower than the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB at market launch and also offers more memory, better efficiency and a modern architecture. It is a particularly attractive option for upgrades from the RTX 3000 or RX 6000 generation. The 8 GB version, on the other hand, should be viewed critically, as it quickly reaches its limits, especially in WQHD and memory-intensive scenarios, and cannot provide a complete picture of the performance of this GPU generation, even if you can perhaps save a one-off 50 USD. In other words, a card with two faces, where the only slightly cheaper offer is clearly the worse one. In view of the different markets, NVIDIA won’t care about this, only the customer should really be sensitized.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review-ft-gigabyte-palit/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLjLrDYcY70)\n\n>**Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti** is the latest in a long line of Blackwell GPUs to hit the market, arriving in both 8GB and 16GB flavours. I was only sent 16GB models for this review and it didn't sound like 8GB variants would be particularly prevalent at retail upon launch – probably for the better considering a 8GB GPU launching at $379 sounds like madness to me.\n\n>But back to the 5060 Ti 16GB, it's a curious GPU that epitomises the term ‘mixed-bag'. On the one hand, rasterisation performance is solid for 1080p and even 1440p gaming, though the latter resolution becomes more of a challenge if you stick to Ultra settings.\n\n>However, compared to the RTX 3060 Ti, we're only looking at a 31% uplift for 1080p rasterised gaming – and that's a GPU which launched at the [end of 2020,](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review/) almost five years ago! It's clearly underwhelming and exemplifies the struggle for meaningful performance increases that this market segment has been crying out for.\n\n>That said, in the context of *today's* market, I don't think the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is a bad product. After all, it's still delivering circa 15% gains over its predecessor, the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, which actually sounds decent compared to some other Blackwell GPUs like the [RTX 5070](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5070-review/), which is just 1-5% ahead of the RTX 4070 Super. As much as we may want larger generational gains, that's just not the reality for the 50 series given it remains on TSMC's 4N node, so I do think we need to be realistic with expectations.\n\n>It also helps that the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is launching with at the lower price point of £399/$429. The 4060 Ti 16GB initially hit the market at £479, though it did later drop below £450, but even against that figure we're looking at an 11% price drop. There is of course a fair bit up in the air around PC hardware prices right now, but I do at least have *some* confidence that this price point will be achievable after seeing the RTX 5070 in stock at MSRP over the last couple of weeks. Heck, it's even been on sale for [*less* than MSRP](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/matthew-wilson/rtx-5070-drops-below-msrp-in-uk/), so we'd hope for more of the same this time around.\n\n>Of course, the RTX 3060 Ti comparison gets much more favourable when looking at ray tracing performance, largely thanks to having double the VRAM. 8GB cards these days just cannot deliver certain experiences when ray tracing is enabled, resulting in the 5060 Ti 16GB being multiple times faster in titles like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.\n\n>You could make the case that the RTX 5070 is the biggest threat to the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB – it's readily in stock at MSRP, offers performance that's some 35-40% better depending on the game, and it's not *too* much more expensive, sitting at £529. That said, it's priced high enough to still be out of reach for many, in which case the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB becomes the obvious choice around the £400 mark – for now, at least.\n\n>So no, it hasn't blown me away, and you can easily argue that the product itself is fairly underwhelming. But in this market segment, Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is our new go-to recommendation – just don't get the 8GB model, please.\n\n>A final word on the two cards tested today. **Palit's Infinity 3** is a capable model, it's clearly built to hit the MSRP and as such is fairly light on features, but it runs quiet and cool, so I can't really complain. **Gigabyte's** **Aorus Elite** is a much more premium offering, sporting RGB lighting, dual-BIOS and a metal backplate, while the cooler is more sophisticated, resulting in even lower thermals and noise levels than the Infinity 3. I don't have a confirmed price for it yet, but it's almost certainly going to come in *well* above MSRP, so as good as it is, be careful not to overpay as the 5070 could make more sense if the pricing creeps closer to £500.\n\n# LanOC\n\n>TBD\n\n# PC World Article\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1xYjf3h_Q)\n\n>TBD\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-tuf-16-gb/)\n\n>For this launch we've updated our test setup again and retested all comparison cards with the newest drivers. We also updated the BIOS on our 9800X3D and added several new games, like our first RT exclusive title Indiana Jones, and Path Tracing is now an additional section in all reviews. At 1440p, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 13% performance uplift over the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB, which is quite small. At 4K, the increase is bigger, reaching 20%. A gen-over-gen improvement of 13% is not much, but at least it's more than RTX 5080 which only got 8% at 1440p. The RTX 5090, 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 did better, giving you an extra 20% at 1440p. Compared to the RTX 3060 Ti from two generations ago, the performance uplift is only 31%, usually we expect a doubling in performance over two generations. With these numbers the RTX 5060 Ti ends up a bit faster than AMD's aging Radeon RX 7700 XT, 11% behind the RX 7800 XT, which is much more expensive of course. NVIDIA's RTX 5070 non-Ti is a whopping 39% faster. The RTX 5060 Ti does not catch last generation's RTX 4070 either, which remains 16% ahead. If you've seen our manual overclocking results, there is a ton of headroom, like +15%, so I have no idea why NVIDIA clocked their card so low, especially considering the fact that it's underperforming by so much.\n\n>The RTX 5060 Ti is a fantastic choice for gaming at 1080p Full HD, especially with a high-refresh-rate monitor. It also has enough muscle for 1440p gaming in most games at maximum details. Some of the most demanding titles, or when RT is enabled will require you to use DLSS though to get a good gaming experience.\n\n>Thanks to its factory overclock, the ASUS TUF OC gains an extra 4% in real-life performance over the base RTX 5060 Ti, which is small, but every bit helps of course. Competing cards achieve similar performance levels, with all cards hitting +3% or +4.\n\n>Power consumption of the RTX 5060 Ti is good. While some other Blackwell cards had quite high power consumption in idle, multi-monitor and media playback, this isn't a problem at all here. The extra memory chips do increase the power draw slightly, but it's not enough to worry about. In gaming, I noticed that all models reach around 160 W without ray tracing, which is well below the default power limit of 180 W. However, when ray tracing is enabled, power usage increases and occasionally reaches the power limit—still, the RTX 5060 Ti is definitely not power starved.\n\n# The FPS Review\n\n>TBD\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n\n>Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti 16GB delivers a solid combination of performance for the suggested $429 base MSRP. However, as we've seen with every other GPU launch of the past five months, retail prices can be much higher. It's impossible to separate performance from pricing when looking at the overall value of a GPU, and the only thing concrete that we can point to are the MSRPs. Except those can run the gamut from being at least moderately accurate to being completely nonsense.\n\n>When the 4060 Ti 16GB came out a month after the 8GB variant, it felt severely underwhelming. Neither version was really designed to handle 4K gaming, but that was the only place where we measured a significant difference in performance. Two years later, things haven't changed *too* much, but the reduced $50 price gap (on paper at least) between the 5060 Ti 8GB and 16GB makes the 16GB a far easier recommendation. In fact, we'll go so far as to question why Nvidia even felt the need to create an 8GB version.\n\n>Yes, 8GB will be cheaper, and it will also be more limited due to the lack of VRAM. There are games (Indiana Jones and the Great Circle) where you can't even try to run ultra settings on an 8GB card. That's an Nvidia promoted game that simply crashes to desktop with a video memory error when you try higher settings on the 4060 and 4060 Ti 8GB GPUs, along with a bunch of other previous generation RTX cards.\n\n>The good news with the 16GB card is that memory bandwidth has improved thanks to GDDR7, so that it's not likely to hit VRAM capacity or bandwidth limitations. 56% more bandwidth than the 4060 Ti is a sizeable improvement. The fact that most games only show about 15% higher performance indicates that GPU compute is the limiting factor more than bandwidth, however.\n\n>But as we've already said numerous times, the price difference could very easily end up being more than $50. And factors like on again/off again tariffs, limited supply, product demand, and more could push the 16GB card to the point where maybe it won't be the better choice. The RTX 5070 still serves as a ceiling on how much more the 5060 Ti 16GB can realistically cost before it's \"too much,\" but with 5070 cards often listed for $700 or more, there's a lot of wiggle room right now.\n\n>Price and availability will be the key determiners of how good the 5060 Ti 16GB looks, and that will also vary by market. Europe and Asia might end up with a much different GPU landscape than the U.S. as far as graphics card values go.\n\n>What we can say is that the 5060 Ti 16GB isn't a massive generational improvement, but it *is* an improvement. It's also *supposed* to be less expensive than its 4060 Ti 16GB predecessor. Those are both good things, and stuff like neural rendering, DLSS 4, and Multi Frame Generation are merely extras that you can use as you see fit. Now we just wait to see what today's launch looks like, how quickly the 5060 Ti models sell out, and how high prices go.\n\n>Our score of 4-stars represents a \"best guess\" on what the 5060 Ti 16GB will look like in the current GPU market. Obviously, prices for all graphics cards, new and used, are all over the map. If the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB costs 50% more than the MSRP, and other cards *don't* show a similar markup, that makes it a worse value and a less desirable card and it would deserve a lower score. We can't predict where things will go, so pay more attention to the performance and real-world pricing than the single score that we've assigned, because uncontrollable factors play into the overall package.\n\n# [Computerbase - German](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-test.92119/)\n\n# [HardwareLuxx - German](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65938-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-mit-16-gb-im-test.html)\n\n# [PCGH - German](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5060-Ti-16GB-Grafikkarte-281131/Tests/Release-Review-Preis-kaufen-Benchmark-Specs-1470373/)\n\n# [Elchapuzasinformatico - Spanish](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2025/04/msi-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-gaming-trio-oc-review/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n# Video Review\n\n# [Der8auer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ5HOxQFKkg&pp=ygUIZGVyYmF1ZXI%3D)\n\n# Digital Foundry Video\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR5phLkePYA)\n\n# [Gamers Nexus Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cskegn1-D7s)\n\n# [Hardware Canucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltc1Lzjfp-c)\n\n# [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6qZwJsp5X4)\n\n# [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBVLnN5UGvk)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLjLrDYcY70)\n\n# [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMOqQS7ItXE)\n\n# Linus Tech Tips\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R2eGg4wRvk)\n\n# Optimum Tech\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1xYjf3h_Q)\n\n# [Techtesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGBkWeGyUc4)\n\n# Tech Yes City",

This inflation is a stupid excuse. 25% faster than a 5 year old 3060 Ti is bad no matter how you flip it. Even NVIDIA knows that and hence the price reduction of both 4060 Ti and 5060 Ti. They even ordered AIB’s to not include 8GB version in review kits! Talk about scummy..",

      "15% over 4060 ti + 15% from overclocking if its ASUS TUF (price of 5070) or 12% if its Zotac.\n\nAlso the highest TDP per CUDA core. If you have a golden wafer, this can oc to 4GHz. Just joking, its probably stopped at 3300MHz and if the motherboard supports v4.0 16x lanes, it will be v4.08x because card is 8x lanes and mobo is v4.0.\n\nI think its a good card for learning CUDA. Because it supports some extra features with its SM120 architecture and cheaper than 5070."

Maybe they don't realize how much 50 percent more is... 50 percent more VRAM just puts the 5060 at the same 12GB as the 3060... and 50 percent more VRAM on the 5070 just puts it at a solid 16-18GB like all the AMD mid range cards and the 4070 TI Super which it is comparable to. RTX 5080 will be at $1k to $1.2k and should definitely have at least 20-24GB of VRAM for that price.\n\nThe 3GB Memory modules which will replace the 2GB ones should be ready for the RTX 50X0 refresh/Supers, so it's not that crazy to want to wait for it.",

However, the worse you go down with cpus, the lower quality it gets. A low end cpu with a b850 performs so much worse than a low end cpu with a 4060/7600.

So yeah... 4K60 is not a \"budget\" option. Let that simmer in your mind.\n\n> the games don't crash because they run out of VRAM.\n\nThats because the devs know the configuration of the consoles and optimise their game to fit within the RAM requirements of the console. PC devs don't have that liberty, they can try and fit within an 8GB VRAM buffer if they want to, but they can't assure that every configuration will work as intended like they can for consoles because there's not one or two set configurations/consoles to build toward.\n\n> The industry moving forward is not \"my own standard\".

You're just upset.",

Problem is it's RDNA3 so it's stuck with awful FSR3, has bad RT performance for it's class, has absolutely awful Path Tracing performance worst than a 3060. 9070 has FSR4 which is pretty good and has much better RT performance but Path Tracing is still oddly awful on it.\n\n\nNow if you go with either you miss out on the army of Nvidia features like actually good productivity app support, good VR support, DLSS, Ray Reconstruction, reflex (AMD has antilag 2 but game support is almost non existent), multiframe gen, DLSS transformer model, path tracing, and the rest of the Nvidia suite.\n\n\nFor me I'd go with a 5060ti 16GB and OC it to get it above 4070 performance. Productivity apps, VR and DLSS are a must for me and 4070 level performance is pretty respectable at path tracing using DLSS (see Digital Foundry s countless videos on it). Sadly it feels like if you want the most \"PC gaming\" gaming experience not having Nvidia is like not using Steam as your game store, it's just a lot of compromises.",
      "Because it simply ISNT important.  Skylitday already completely debunked your nonsense on this -TWICE-.  \n\nthere is no world - none - where the bandwidth is insufficient for this GPU die.  It will not bottleneck performance.  The card simply isnt that powerful.",

      "It's funny how many referred to the RTX 5060ti 16GB as the \"RX 9000 series killer\", especially with rumors that showed the RX 9070xt perform about the same as an RX 4070 Super/RX 7900GRE, I already expected it to be underwhelming since the specs were leaked, the 128-bit memory bus is the biggest bottleneck, otherwise it could've been one of the best graphics card ever released.",
      "Uhh.... I'll be on the 1080ti until it breaths it's last dying breath. \n\nNot paying these prices for a graphics card unless I absolutely have to.\n\nAnd at that point it's going to be an entire system overhaul.",
      "Honestly, good. I hope they all sit on the shelves until prices stabilize again. We went through this in 2020 and again now. It’s not the product that’s bad. It’s the inflated prices."

Its holding up fine but recent games seems to struggle to much.\n\nAnd i have kind fixed budget. And I need to buy something.\n\nBest i can afford is RTX 5060 TI 16GB  or RX 7800xt (previously i have considered Intel B580 so its already a huge price increase.) So RX 9070 or RTX 4070 or 5070 is not an option)\n\nIt has to be one of those two.\n\nIn theory 7800xt destroys 5060 TI. In every gameplay i saw like 10 to 30 fps more with RX 7800xt\n\nSo its seems that choice is simple. But, (there is always but) its not that simple.\n\nA small background.\n\nI play at 1080p 60hz LCD screen or 4K 60hz TV screen (only older games - 1080ti is too weak for 4K)\n\nI have rather weak CPU i7 11600H with DDR4 3200 memory.\n\nI would not change that in near future.\n\nAnd here comes upscaling and frame generation\n\nNvidia DLSS an FG is far more superior and common than FSR3.1.\n\nAnd i think for 4K gaming even RX 7800xt will struggle to to get 60FPS without upscaling.\n\nFor newer games (GTA 6 ???) even at 1080p i guess\n\nSo card with bad upscaling is not good choice for next few years....\n\nSo although im impressed with raw performance of RX 7800xt I still consider waiting for price of 5060 TI 16GB decrease, so it will be cheaper than RX 7800xt\n\nBut choice has to be made.\n\nWhich one would you buy?",

      "I own a 7700 XT and I never experienced that.",
      "I would personally buy the 5060 ti. The 7800 xt is stuck with FSR 3.1 (which is abysmal), is less efficient, and performs worse with RT on (unless it's a super light, and therefore pointless rt implementation). The 5060 ti should overclock quite easily to just about match a 4070 in raw performance (not that far off of the 7800xt).\n\nEdit: It may also be worth sticking with your 1080 ti for just a bit longer and saving enough to get a 9070, 9070 xt, or 5070 ti",
      "Tbh the 5060ti 16gb makes more sense to me, yes the 7800xt is a bit faster, but i think the current version of DLSS grants a bigger advantage. FSR 3 is pretty meh and falls really short compared to DLSS 4, only the 9000 series with FSR 4 comes close but obviously you'll be spending more for a 9070/xt.",
      "I just bought rtx 5060ti :) not the greatest model MSI ventus 2x oc plus but it will do the job.\nI found it at mrsp so it turned out to be 50$ cheeper than the cheapest Rx 7800 that I could find.\nI would get it on Wednesday. I will let you know how it works:)\nWas it good choice? Time will tell...",
      "I dont agree, dlss quality is like 30% performance increase, and basically all games where you will struggle with fps will have it.",
      "In truth, you’re asking if you should buy the midrange card (7800XT) or the budget option from the newest series (5060TI) which is purely up to you. Me though, I wouldn’t spend an equivalent amount on the budget option when you have a midrange card capable of some great raster performance available to you. Your cpu isn’t all that weak, and there’s nothing wrong with ddr4 memory, your cpu gets some pretty decent price to performance and in truth I don’t understand why you think you’ll need any kind of frame gen. If you want frames and raw performance, the 7800XT is your choice, if you *want* to use frame gen and have slightly less frames without using that feature then you should get the 5060TI. My choice would be the 7800XT though. I use it right now with a 9600x and I’m pushing the last of us part one with the settings cranked as high as they’ll go in 1080p well over 90-120 frames. Keep in mind ray tracing isn’t available in every game and that’s the reason (outside of greed) why nvidia costs so much.",
      "I DO have a7800xt and ive never seen anything that makes videos, even 4k video look any different than when i watch on another device",
      "It helps a lot and it's doing it with much better results than fsr3.1. if fsr 4 was available for rx 7800 than it will be much simpler choice. But we don't when  it will be (and if it will be because it's not clear)\nFor recent games it's seems like Rx will better choice, but for future releases? Not so sure",
      "As you can see it's hard choice :) \nAbout budget. It's not that I can't afford more expensive card. If I want to I can go and buy 5090 out of the shelf. It's that I think it's not worth it. I'm not heavy player. But I do like to play occasionally. To buy better card I will have to replace screen, cpu ,motherboard, memory and psu to make it sense. So it's pointless to buy better card ither than those two mentioned in my opinion.\nAbout DLLs and performance. My nephew has a rtx 4060 paired with Ryzen 5600.\nI was amazed what this setup can do with dlss on cyberpunk or last of us compared to what I was getting with my 1080ti\nThat the performance that I was looking for.\nAnd I almost bought 4060.\nBut then Intel b580 came out.\nI almost bought it :) . But It was little overpriced at the beginning. So I decided to wait. And then came Nvidia 50xx card release with 5060 announcement.\nI thought I will wait a little bit longer.\nAnd now when it's released I almost bought it :)\nBut I watched YouTube video with comparsion to rx 7800, where red team destroys green:)\nBut it was with very strong processor of course, without using DLLs or fsr , no RT.\nSo after all this digging in internet I still don't know ...

      "I have used both and really only started getting fed up with Nvidia with extreme prices and planned obsolescence because they use a smaller amount of memory. This is on purpose as its not a huge cost. So use what you want. Nobody will be able to afford upgrades soon. Get a card with the most ram.",
      "If you don't want to wait 7800xt.\nAt 4k FSR3.1 is not bad. Yes DLSS is more available but you can always optiscaler to try to inject FSR.\nNewer game that still lack any info can be as bad as optimized as it can be that 5060ti struggle alot even with DLSS and the excess performance of 7800XT might help especially in 4k.\nFor a rather old title, your best bet is using Lossless scaling in my opinion anyway.\nBut since AMD haven't yet release it's 9060xt, there is also option to wait for a bit to see how it's performance and hopefully at that point 5060ti/7800xt price also going down.\nSo more options as well.\n\nFor for now, my pick would be 7800xt.\nUnless you care about RT or efficiency (5060ti is a very efficient card) but probably wait is also a better choice.",
      "I have both. 5060ti in my main rig, and a 7800xt in our lounge gaming PC. I play at 1440p on the main PC, and the 7800xt at 4K in the lounge PC.\n\nThe 7800xt plays games like dragon age Veilguard and AC shadows at 60fps with some settings tweaks or frame gen. I generally steer clear of upscaling as I don’t like the artifacts it creates and FSR3 is pretty mid, however XeSS can be used by any card just like FSR3, and it looks a lot better imo especially at 4K.\n\nI think the 7800xt is a better option for 4K as it has more brute strength in terms of rasterisation. I’m happy with what I use it for. \n\nHowever, DLSS4 is very impressive, the best upscaling I’ve seen so far. It’s not perfect though, there are still artifacts etc, just a lot less than DLSS3. \n\nI personally use the 5060ti for high fps at 1440p, as it has more dials to turn as DLSS is more viable to use. I really don’t like upscaling in general, but especially at lower resolutions and DLSS is better at lower resolutions. I also chose it as it’s my main PC and it runs a fair bit more efficiently, and my main PC gets used a lot more than the lounge PC. The 5060ti sits at anywhere between 150-190w whereas the 7800xt is more like 190-250w.\n\nPersonally since you don’t utilise high fps in either situation, the 7800xt is a better option for you as it’s more capable at 4K. If DLSS or power efficiency is a major point of contention for you then maybe consider the 5060ti.",

      "if it was 100 less it'd be a good card lol",
      "It's all about price, it seems like an average card but the 8gb one is ridiculous at the price point, just needs to be removed from the stack at this point and offer 12gb + across the board (more ideally 16gb) for this price region.\n\n\nMSRP is worthless these days as well sadly so reviewing is difficult as the context is changing, saying a card is good or bad typically hinges on where it is priced against the competition.",

      "About a year ago people were telling us we were wrong about 8GB being too little VRAM. So now reviewers finally agree that 8GB is too low and they suggest a 12GB card. How long will that last?",

      "Not the worst, but it’s still pretty underwhelming. They say it’s a decent uplift of about 15-20% from the previous gen, but you’re comparing it to the wet noodle that was the 4060ti, which couldn’t decide if it was a 10% uplift over the 3060ti or slightly behind it when it’s crippled bandwidth started making an impact on performance. It’s even more amusing realizing the 3080, a 4 year old card mind you, is still beating the 5060ti in rasterized performance. \n\nPoint is, people are a bit excited at the fact it has 16gb of vram and isn’t gonna cost another $100 more than the 8gb model, but that’s still a big *if*, considering there is no FE model for AIBs to base the price around.",
      "What was the historical uplift? Say 1060 to 2060 to 3060?",

      "Honest question, do people still expect like 30-40% uplift every generation? The chip hasn't changed much at all from 40 to 50 series. Besides, most people don't upgrade gen to gen, so even the it's 15-20% better doesn't matter because people are comparing from multiple gens back sometimes.",

      "For Reddit any NVIDIA card is the worst of all time.",
      "Depends what time period you include historically.  20 years ago, generation to generation jumps were much bigger.  Partly because they were starting out with much more constrained designs that were easier to improve on, and partly because the fabrication was doing better with scaling from generation to generation.  But no matter how you approach the data, this is a small jump.  Historically, it probably would have been called a small die shrink and this would have been the \"X50\" -> \"X50, Upgraded Edition\" rather than the \"Y50.\"  It's really only being marketing as a whole new generation of the product line because the marketing department figures we are due for a new generation.\n\nThe 1600 series and RTX2000 launched on 12nm (at TSMC).\n\nRTX 3000 was 8nm (but manufactured at Samsung, so not directly comparable)\n\nRTX 4000 was 4nm (Back to TSMC)\n\nRTX 5000 is on a slightly different/newer process node at TSMC but still advertised at \"4nm.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nvidia_graphics_processing_units#RTX_50_series\n\nSo they underlying manufacturing technology hasn't had a generational jump this time.  That limits how much new stuff NV can pack into the design.  They get a few percent from improved design, and a few percent from refinements in the manufacturing process.  But in ye Oelden days of advanced CPU/GPU product lines, something advertised as a whole new generation of the product line would typically happen when manufacturing tech could cram about 2x as many parts onto a chip, so you would expect to get >2x the performance generation to generation rather than like 20%.  Since modern manufacturing is already counting individual atoms in numbers you could keep track of on your fingers when laying down layers of material, there's a lot less \"low hanging fruit\" to improve on these days.  Whatever they release as the \"RTX 6000 series\" will probably be the sort of improvement over the 4000 series that folks were hoping for, with all the manufacturing process improvements that weren't ready for this product cycle.",
      "I believe the 8gb versions (they’re releasing a NON-ti 5060 eventually? what is this, a graphics card for ants?) exist for 3 reasons:\n\n1. Price anchoring for the 16gb version. Although it’s only an additional +13% in price, so that’s pretty questionable.   \n\n2. Provide an entry level, 16gb card, that people can afford, in lieu of scalped **70+ SKU models.   \n\n3. Compete with Intel / AMD entries, simply to recapture market share. People climb the ladder over time, so 5060 buyers are (a) not buying competitor products and (b) going to spend more future money with Nvidia.\n\nAs a 3060 12gb owner I’ve felt lucky for years given the 12gb and performance. I thought the 5060ti 16gb would be a significant upgrade, but they’re saying it’s only 15% on average, 30% in **some** games. Ugh.",
      "It feels like pricing and naming/positioning, is what many criticism boils down in reality. Not just for this card but some others. If some of these cards didn't have its name/position and the price to match that name/position, they might be much better regarded.",
      "At $430, just like last gen, the 16GB is a perfectly capable GPU with plenty of VRAM. Redditors are just idiots."

      "Ehh, if you checked the leaked specs you would know what we could expect, +25% cores and +50% bandwidth from 4060. That should give at least 30% improvement. 5060 will easily be 3070 lvl likely  higher",

And that happy moment was instantly ruined by crypto. The value improvements have been mediocre ever since.\n\nBut in this new era of cost-per-frame mediocrity, the 5060 Ti 16GB could be a solid buy. Not a card to be enthused about, but a card with no major shortcomings, so that’s something I guess.",

      "If it's 16 gb version then yes. If 8 GB version, definitely no. Any new game these days tend to get past 7 gb VRAM limit easily. 8 GB cards in 2025 are DOA even for 1080p.",
      "If you have the budget for it then the 16GB 5060 TI is going to last you a lot longer than the 3060.",
      "Ti version have 2 variants, 8gb and 16gb. And they both have MSRP prices naturally. OP didn't give any details so instead i gave detail in my answer.",
      "By god , yes. The 5060ti 8gb can’t even hold a good frame rate on game at 1080p per the hardware unboxed video. It’s the worst reviewed card I’ve ever seen Steve do.",
      "wtf there’s an 8gb ti ? My bad , that’s gross",
      "not bashing in any kind, but this comment chain makes for a good example that Nvidia's silencing of the 8gb 5060ti worked on some people, and why it's a dirty ass move, and why it was important that some reviewers called this bullshit out.",
      "16 GB 5060ti > 4070 considering prices.",
      "at msrp i think its alright definitely 1080p max settings doable",
      "Whatever you do, DO NOT get an 8GB card in 2025.\n\nEither go with the 16GB version, or get the 5070. Also, if you can find it for a decent price, the 4070Super is a very good card.",
      "5060 Ti doesn't run at x16 on anything, it's an x8 card. It'll run at PCIe 3.0x8 in your system.\n\nTechpowerup have tested it and you're looking at 5% performance hit or so by running at 3.0. Fine, in other words.\n\nIt'll be significantly faster than the 1060. Be wary of driver issues though, many people have been unable to use their new 5060 Ti due to the driver - your mileage may vary, many saying it works fine for them.",
      "In case you didn't know, the 5060 Ti 8GB version exists.",
      "I've been thinking the same thing; I've got a GTX 1060 6GB that's starting to show its age.\n\nMy options are an RTX 3060 12GB for £240 or the 5060 Ti 16GB for £400\n\nI haven't played many AAA games in a while, but I'd like to play the new Doom when its released. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart was a struggle at 1080p on lower settings.\n\nThe complication is that I'm running Ubuntu so there's a slight performance hit from Proton, and I've got a Z390 motherboard which only supports PCIe gen 3, so I think the 5060 Ti will essentially run x8 rather than x16 which might also hit my performance a bit.\n\nAny advice will be appreciated, I've not kept up with modern hardware in recent years",
      "According to TechPowerUp, the RTX 5060 Ti is 3x faster than the GTX 1060.\n\nIs that an amazing performance jump for waiting 9 years? No, not really. But is the 5060 Ti 16GB one of the better options if you need to upgrade now? Reluctantly, yes.",
      "Make sure to get the 16gb. \n\nReviews are just dropping on the 8GB and its basically DOA.",
      "I deleted my comment. I had no idea NVIDIA had the audacity to make an 8gb TI .",
      "Yes. At 1080p in most games (excluding intense titles) you’ll get at least 150 fps with decent settings.\n\nI’m also in the EU!",
      "You're upgrading 4 gens, so obviously it's worth it.\n\nYet the fact that you're asking and not just buying tells me that, after all, the 1060 might still fit your needs for one more gen and let you jump another gen to 6000 (this is what I did from 970 to 5000). On the other hand, you also said that it's \"starting to show its limit\" so ...\n\nIt's up to you. If the 1060 is too limiting, a 5000 will be a quite noticeable upgrade. If it's still doing its job and you can hold, you can wait and hope that 6000s make the gap even better (and by a better margin than waiting for 5000 rather than upgrading when 4000s released, which is quite probable)",
      "Get 5060, not much to think about it. PCIe3 is not going to matter until you start running out of VRAM and the game starts swapping assets to RAM. With 16GB and at 1080p you'll likely never encounter that scenario unless the game has awful optimization or it has some kind of memory leak.\n\nI think £400 is basically the MSRP in the UK? Even less reason to hesitate."

Read here!\n\n**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**\n\nThere is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).\n\n**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**\n\n**Common Troubleshooting Steps**\n\n* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11\n* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.\n* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance\n\nIf it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:\n\n* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.\n* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.\n* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.\n\nIf you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.\n\n**Common Questions**\n\n* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*\n\n**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**\n\n* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*\n* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*\n* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*\n\nRemember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.",

      "I don't think I have ever seen these many bug fixes in a Nvidia driver in my almost 10 years of using nvidia hardware. This really shows just how unfinished their drivers were in the 572 series and they still went ahead with it.

      "PSA: These drivers might stop reporting GPU temperature after waking the PC from sleep. Read this!\n\n\\--\n\nNote: This does not affect people using factory curves. Or people that doesn't use MSIAB or any other fan control tool (FanControl, Argus)\n\nThis affects users with custom curves in MSIAB, and/or users who control case fans using fan control software (FanControl, Argus)\n\n\\---\n\nUpdate (I wasn't aware): I was informed \"Restating\" driver via WIN+CTRL+SHIFT+B doesn't really restart the driver (that explains why it was never a solution to any issue I found in the past).\n\nTo quickly restart the driver, use \"restart64.exe\" which comes with CRU.\n\nThank you, guys, for that vital piece of info!... and yes, using \"restart64.exe\" makes the GPU report temps again. (No need to toggle \"Manage GPU Performance Counters\").\n\n\\--\n\nAfter waking the PC from sleep, temp readings in MSIAB stopped working. I was not aware and that made my GPU go all the way to my set max 85c and my GPU was throttling to keep the temps down because the fans (custom curve) never ramped up.\n\nTested it twice and is reproducible.\n\nThe solution for now is to run \"restart64.exe\" to restart the driver.\n\n**Steps to reproduce (sent to NV already).**\n\n\\- After installing 576.02 and rebooting.\n\n\\- Make sure the temp reading in MSIAB works.\n\n\\- Put the PC to sleep.\n\n\\- Wake the PC up.\n\n\\- Check in MSIAB. The temp sensors stop reporting.\n\n\\- Run \"restart64.exe\". The driver will restart.\n\n\\- Check MSIAB, you'll see the temps working again. (no need to restart MSIAB during any of these steps).\n\n\\- Repeat Sleep/wake up.\n\n\\- MSIAB temps stop again.\n\n~~-~~ Run \"restart64.exe\"\n\n\\- MSIAB report temps again.\n\nThank me later.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised NV quickly releases a hotfix for this.\n\nAfter 2 days.

    "comments": [
      "I'm pretty sure the headline is just describing the 5060 Ti 16gb - more VRAM than its 8gb counterpart, 70$ cheaper MSRP compared to the 4060 Ti 16gb",
      "16GB are not sufficient for “budget” gpu?",
      "The vram should look like 5060 8gb, 5060ti 12gb, 5070 16gb. I am done with nshita. My 3060ti 4 years ago was fighting with 2080S. And this shit cannot win with 4070 … Polish website did good test https://www.purepc.pl/test-msi-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-gaming-recenzja-opinia-wydajnosc-cena-premiera-blackwell?page=0,83\n\n4 years later and new generation is just 30% better than 3060ti…",
      "You could just read the first three paragraphs of the article. Where they very clearly state that they think the 8 GB stuff is kind of ridiculous and like have the 16 GB option isn’t insanely more expensive and only $50. I think they more generally think there shouldn’t be an 8 GB 60 TI. \n\nPersonally speaking I think if Nvidia really wants to keep the 5060 at 8 GB I would prefer if they made the 5060 TI either have a 12 GB base with a $50 extra 16 gigabyte version or just had the 16 GB option. With the 5070 starting at 16 too.",
      "Hopefully they're talking about the 8GB variant, cus they've completely lost the plot if 16GB isn't reasonable for a 60Ti. \n\nAMD's best current gen offering tops out at 16 for shits sake lol.",
      "Well, they are saying “more vram and a price ‘paper cut’ could make for a compelling GPU.” Like they are saying that it having more VRAM than the 8 gig version and being slightly lower price than the 4060ti 16 gig could make it a compelling GPU for prospective buyers. They aren’t saying it needs a price cut or more vram. So I think you are just misreading the headline.",
      "Shouldn't be able to call a card with 8 gb a 60 tier card, maybe a 50 ti but not 60. Same goes for the 9060 XT 8 gb",
      "lol. You’re not done with Nvidia. AMD simply isn’t competitive. And Intel still needs a decade to catch up, at least.",
      "What a garbage card",
      "Yes, and are saying that it has more VRAM and a slightly lower price which makes it compelling. You seem to be reading it as if they are calling for a price cut or more vram, they aren’t. You just aren’t parsing the headline the way they intended for it to be read. They aren’t saying that more VRAM and a price cut would make it compelling, but rather that the more VRAM and price cut that has already happened makes it potentially more compelling to prospective buyers.",
      "They’re not competitive at the high end. This isn’t high end.",
      "I will go with 9070xt for 700euro. Next 3-4 years it will keep me going. Then I will see what will be best perf/€",
      ">Unless you have the money for 80 or 90 card no one should be looking at Nvidia what so ever.\n\nThis is such nonsense, lmao.\n\nI can't believe people aren't embarrassed to write something like this.\n\nWhat if you want any of the huge number of perks of having an RTX 50 series card?\n\nSay, DP 2.1 with full UHBR20 bandwidth for instance. \n\nOr DLSS4.\n\nOr Reflex.\n\nOr RTX HDR.\n\nOr tons of other stuff?",
      "Or Stable Diffusion for example.   \n\nI’m not going through extra pain and problems to use SD with an AMD card for lower it/s for a possible lower price when a 5060ti is cheap(ish) and has 16gb VRAM.",
      "Commenting under the discussion of an article while admitting you didn’t even bother opening the article is… quite the move.",
      "We dont talk about AI here because AMD fanboys have no idea what its about.",
      "You’re definitely just misreading the headline. It’s a little clunky but I understood it immediately.",
      "The only viable place for this card is LLM setups, not gaming. You can get 32GB of VRAM and 544GB/ps bandwidth each at least if you overclock the memory. All for less than 1K if they are at MSRP. This is gonna hit the 3090 used market pretty hard because for around the same price, you can get 8gb more VRAM and run tensor parallel and have around the same memory bandwidth.",
      "Because we're talking about the title? \n\nAdmitting you've failed to understand that and acting like it's some sort of own is in fact...'quite the move'.",

      "I think the reason why they sell the 8gb 5060 ti even tho they could sell u a 16gb with higher margins.\n\nIt is to make those who buy the 8gb end up having to upgrade sooner due to the lack of vram, essentially making you buy an entire new gpu which is even more profit then selling more Vram at higher margins.",

It costs $5/GB at most.  8gb to 16gb adds $40 to the cost.\n\nHigh res textures is the cheapest way to make a game look better with no performance hit.\n\nPeople take 15 year old Skyrim and add a high res texture pack and it's a whole new game.\n\nPeople need to accept the real reason Nvidia only puts 8gb is so companies don't go back to buying consumer GPUs for AI like they did in 2021.\n\nBut there's way too little outrage and rationalizing on the part of gaming hobbyists.  8GB is NOT enough.  It's 2025.\n\nMy GTX 960 that I bought TEN years ago had 6gb.",

So you’re standing in the store thinking “but for just $20 I get 10 more fps.” Now you’ve moved from the no Ti to the Ti. Then you think “for just $50 more I am future proofed.” And you just convinced yourself spend $70 more while also convincing yourself it’s worth it."

Some cheaper PSUs might have a 550w rating but only output up to say 450-500w on the 12v rail.  If the power on the 12v rail is 500w+, I reckon you should be good.\n\nThis number [here](https://imgur.com/a/BEV8dS6) is what you're looking for.",

These changes are checked into the main driver branches, which are eventually run through a massive QA process and released.  \n\nSince we have so many changes being checked in, we usually try to align driver releases with significant game or product releases. This process has served us pretty well over the years but it has one significant weakness. Sometimes a change that is important to many users might end up sitting and waiting until we are able to release the driver.  \n\n**The GeForce Hotfix driver is our way to trying to get some of these fixes out to you more quickly**. **These drivers are basically the same as the previous released version, with a small number of additional targeted fixes. The fixes that make it in are based in part on your feedback in the Driver Feedback threads and partly on how realistic it is for us to quickly address them. These fixes (and many more) will be incorporated into the next official driver release, at which time the Hotfix driver will be taken down**.  \n\nTo be sure, these Hotfix drivers are beta, optional and provided as-is. They are run through a much abbreviated QA process. The sole reason they exist is to get fixes out to you more quickly. The safest option is to wait for the next WHQL certified driver. But we know that many of you are willing to try these out.  As a result, we only provide NVIDIA Hotfix drivers through our NVIDIA Customer Care support site.  \n   \n[Click here](https://international.download.nvidia.com/Windows/576.15hf/576.15-desktop-win10-win11-64bit-international-dch-hf.exe) to download the GeForce Hotfix display driver version 576.15 for Windows 10 x64 / Windows 11 x64.  \n   \nThese Hotfix drivers represent a lot of additional work by our engineering teams, We hope they provide value for you.",

I am not sure the 5060 can even handle two streams with how anemic it is, so get at least a 5070 at minimum.\n\nAnd if you want the actual cheap option, go Intel B580, it will be better for encoding at a cheaper price.\n\nHere is a thread:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelArc/comments/1j436iq/intel\\_b580\\_for\\_obs\\_encoding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelArc/comments/1j436iq/intel_b580_for_obs_encoding/)",

These changes are checked into the main driver branches, which are eventually run through a massive QA process and released.  \n\nSince we have so many changes being checked in, we usually try to align driver releases with significant game or product releases. This process has served us pretty well over the years but it has one significant weakness. Sometimes a change that is important to many users might end up sitting and waiting until we are able to release the driver.  \n\n**The GeForce Hotfix driver is our way to trying to get some of these fixes out to you more quickly. These drivers are basically the same as the previous released version, with a small number of additional targeted fixes. The fixes that make it in are based in part on your feedback in the Driver Feedback threads and partly on how realistic it is for us to quickly address them. These fixes (and many more) will be incorporated into the next official driver release, at which time the Hotfix driver will be taken down.**  \n\nTo be sure, these Hotfix drivers are beta, optional and provided as-is. They are run through a much abbreviated QA process. The sole reason they exist is to get fixes out to you more quickly. The safest option is to wait for the next WHQL certified driver. But we know that many of you are willing to try these out.  As a result, we only provide NVIDIA Hotfix drivers through our NVIDIA Customer Care support site.  \n   \n[Click here](https://international-gfe.download.nvidia.com/Windows/576.26hf/576.26-desktop-notebook-win10-win11-64bit-international-dch.hf.exe) to download the GeForce Hotfix display driver version 576.26 for Windows 10 x64 / Windows 11 x64.  \n   \nThese Hotfix drivers represent a lot of additional work by our engineering teams, We hope they provide value for you",

I'd argue any performance loss because Nvidia was too cheap to go 16x is stupid but it's not the biggest issue.",
      "surprisingly little difference",
      "Correct, the GPU chip physically has only 8 lanes of connectivity",
      "tldr:\n\n>**x8 4.0**  \nWe are thrilled to report that running the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti with PCI-Express 4.0 x8 has an insignificant impact on performance. Averaged across all game tests, we see a 2% drop in performance at 1080p, and an even smaller 1% drop in performance at 1440p. While not exactly relevant to this GPU, even 4K Ultra HD posts only a 1% drop in performance with PCIe Gen 4 x8. This should be fantastic news for everyone who has the latest processors (Intel 12th Gen or later, AMD Ryzen 5000 or later), but with a motherboard that only supports Gen 4 on the main x16 PEG slot. There aren't really any outliers to report where the lack of Gen 5 puts the RTX 5060 Ti at a disadvantage. So, for those of you on mid-range chipsets such as the AMD B650 or Intel B660, rejoice.\n\n>**x8 3.0**  \nThe next data point is Gen 3 x8. This would be applicable for those using an older processor or APU that only puts out Gen 3 PCIe, but one that's fairly recent. A good example of this would be the Ryzen 5000G Cezanne, which can be used on Gen 4-capable AMD 500-series chipset motherboards, but only has a Gen 3-capable PCIe root. Other examples would be Intel 10th Gen Core Comet Lake on Intel 500-series chipset motherboards. Here, the RTX 5060 Ti posts a 4% loss in performance averaged across all game tests. This is an acceptable level of performance loss, all things considered, and should give confidence to those on these older platforms.\n\n>**Ray Tracing, DLSS, and Frame Generation**  \nThe above trends also hold with ray tracing. Gen 4 x8 loses 2% performance averaged across all tests at 1080p, and about 5% with Gen 3 x8. Although small, the 5% performance loss could pinch a little, considering that ray tracing imposes its own performance cost on the overall performance of the game.\n\n>**Closing Thoughts**  \nA mid-range performance-segment GPU like the RTX 5060 Ti should be affected much less from changes in host interface bandwidth than a high-end GPU like the RTX 5090, and that much is evident from our testing. The RTX 5060 Ti isn't all that faster than the RTX 4060 Ti to begin with, and so it was natural for Gen 4 x8 and Gen 3 x8 to post only marginal drops in performance, which become a bit more pronounced in ray tracing tests, where the overall cost of ray tracing weighs in. That said, it's worth noting that while we got the RTX 5060 Ti to run on Gen 4 and Gen 3 PCIe, the processor is still the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D—the fastest CPU for gaming as of this writing, and so any performance deltas you see on your Gen 4 or Gen 3 platform could be a result of having a processor slower than the 9800X3D.",
      "So one of the pins near my pcie4 x16 slots in broken near the end of my motherboard, so basically, does the gpu have a x16 layout but only use x8? And please tell me if the connectors near the end are used or not, or is it just the x8",
      "arent they PCI 5.0? 5@x8 has the same bandwidth than 4@x16. Dunno about latency thou\n\nBut yeh I know that this card probably wont be installed on PCI5 capable systems",
      "Any reason they are not comparing x8 vs. x16?"

    "selftext": "- compilation of 16 launch reviews with ~6420 gaming benchmarks at 1080p, 1440p, 2160p\n- only benchmarks at real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks\n- geometric mean in all cases\n- standard raster performance without ray-tracing and/or DLSS/FSR/XeSS\n- extra ray-tracing benchmarks (mostly without upscaler) after the standard raster benchmarks\n- stock performance on (usually) reference/FE boards, no overclocking\n- factory overclocked cards were normalized to reference clocks/performance, but just for the overall performance average (so the listings show the original performance result, just the performance index has been normalized)\n- missing results were extrapolated (for a more accurate average) based on the available & former results\n- performance average is (some) weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks\n- all reviews should have used newer drivers for _all_ cards\n- power draw numbers based on a couple of reviews, always for the graphics card only\n- performance/price ratio (higher is better) for 1440p raster performance and 1440p ray-tracing performance\n- for the full results and some more explanations check [3DCenter's launch analysis](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti)\n\nNote: There are hardly any performance results available for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB. Therefore, their performance was extrapolated for the overview table based solely on the difference between 4060Ti-8GB and 4060Ti-16GB, taking into account a small offset due to the different TDP (which does not exist for the 5060Ti).\n\nNote: Sometimes the following tables are become to big (wide) for mobile browsers on Reddit (last column is the GeForce RTX 5070). In this case, please try the [mobile version of

RA = Raster, RT = Ray-Tracing, E.Eff. = Energy Efficiency, P/P = Performance/Price Ratio    \nNote: retail prices assuming real availability - for old SKUs, these are typically from the years 2023/2024; for the Radeon RX 9070 it's simple an assumption\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**On the performance of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti _16GB_:** The card beats the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti with +14-17% more performance, in line with the gains of most other RTX50 cards. Another advantage of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is that the 16 GB version is now the primary version (in contrast to the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti) and also comes at no major additional cost. On the AMD side, the Radeon RX 7700 XT is only a suitable counterpart at raster rendering, but is clearly beaten at ray tracing - and of course also has the smaller amount of VRAM. At best, the Radeon RX 7800 XT is a passable opponent to the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, but also costs a little more (in Europe). Unfortunately, the US prices are difficult to assess at the moment, as the US market is completely overbought.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Important note on the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti _8GB_:** The above performance evaluation based on average frame rates does not show the complete picture for this GPU. But even with average frame rates, it can be seen that the card lags behind in raster rendering from 2160p, but in ray tracing from 1080p. However, differences at average frame rates are always only the very last sign of too less VRAM. Long before that, there are already (sometimes considerable) disadvantages at the minimum frame rates as well as a declining image quality due to missing textures, delayed loading textures or even a generally lower texture quality. This was explained quite well in a video by [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdZoa6Gzl6s), and is a known problem with too less VRAM. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB is therefore already borderline even under 1080p and can therefore not be recommended with a clear conscience for a GPU purchase in 2025.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nList of hardware reviews evaluated for this analysis:\n\n- [ComputerBase](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-test.92119/)\n- [Cowcotland](https://www.cowcotland.com/articles/4571/test-gainward-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-python-blackwell-enfin-pour-le-plus-grand-nombre.html)\n- [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n- [Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cskegn1-D7s)\n- [Hardware & Co](https://hardwareand.co/dossiers/gpu/test-de-la-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-enfin-une-carte-blackwell-capable-de-faire-oublier-sa-devanciere)\n- [Hardwareluxx](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65938-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-mit-16-gb-im-test.html)\n- [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-im-test-sparsam-im-verbrauch-aber-nicht-ganz-unproblematisch-fuer-gamer/)\n- [KitGuru](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review-ft-gigabyte-palit/)\n- [PC Games Hardware](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5060-Ti-16GB-Grafikkarte-281131/Tests/Release-Review-Preis-kaufen-Benchmark-Specs-1470373/)\n- [PurePC](https://www.purepc.pl/test-msi-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-gaming-recenzja-opinia-wydajnosc-cena-premiera-blackwell)\n- [Quasarzone](https://quasarzone.com/bbs/qc_bench/views/94640)\n- [SweClockers](https://www.sweclockers.com/test/41012-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-mellankort-mellanpris-mellanbra)\n- [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/palit-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-infinity-3-16-gb/)\n- [TechSpot](https://www.techspot.com/review/2979-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb/) / [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6qZwJsp5X4)\n- [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n- [Tweakers](https://tweakers.net/reviews/13162/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-haalt-de-lat-maar-die-lag-niet-hoog.html)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource: [3DCenter.org](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti)\n\nPS: 3DCenter is free of advertising and is financed solely by donations.",

      "Nvidia is really trying to make each new product a hard buy",
      "Only a 30% performance gain over the 3060 Ti after 4.5 years.\n\nI’ve become bearish on meaningful value gains in newer generations of hardware going forward. Not even a drastic node shrink (from Samsung 8N to TSMC N4), was enough to provide a meaningful cost-per-frame improvement from the 3060 Ti to the 4060 Ti. When the next node shrink occurs with the 6060 Ti, I expect Nvidia to pass very little cost savings to the consumer.\n\nPeople who expect good value gains will be waiting a looong time for a card that provides just that. It ironically makes the 16GB 5060 Ti a solid card to buy; it’s a card specifically designed for people who wait.",
      "I honestly think the x60 cards would be quite solid across the board if they weren't vram limited\n\nI rarely hit the limits of what my hardware can actually do, because I'm always running of vram and losing 70% of my framerate",
      "the 5060 ti 16gb is the only card worth it, and only for people who are still running 6gb/8gb versions of the older x060 ti cards\n\nit's not even something that shows up in benchmarks.\n\nthose 8gb cards absolutely shit the bed the millisecond vram starts paging, and they have effective \\~6.5GB because of what windows' compositor is always stealing.\n\nif you turn off dlss and frame gen you might get lucky and run with low enough vram usage to be stable.\n\nbut if you run with dlss and fg on, you're fucked. like with oblivion I used engine.ini edits to force the engine to limit its streaming pool and effects so that they only consume 70% of my vram, but the game isn't the problem.. frame gen is. turning frame gen on increases my 50fps to \\~80-100, sounds good, til you notice it also increases vram usage by 15% the second you toggle it on. then you start paging out of vram and it's stutterville at 20fps, frame gen just straight up disables, and if you disable dlss your native fps has gone from 50 to 14.\n\nbeen dealing with this since the 2060 series because I constantly end up with the low vram x060 ti card. this time around I threw in the extra $100 to get the 16gb version.\n\nI don't even care if the perf gains are minimal. you can give me 15% higher fps, but that extra vram meaning I no longer deal with incessant framerate drops in every single AAA+ makes it worth every penny",
      "Please never stop doing these meta reviews dude its awesome!",
      "drop texture res? Im running Oblivion with medium textures and I don't have any of the issues you're describing with FG on."

    "selftext": "From NVIDIA Article: [Click Here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/doom-the-dark-ages-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-out-now)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qrptcalasj0f1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=6959b1d68500d91a4ebe11bf623b0a82f83d470e\n\nThe long-awaited, much-anticipated *DOOM: The Dark Ages* has received universal acclaim from reviewers, and is now available in Early Access for those who purchased the Premium Edition or our [GeForce RTX 50 Series bundle](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/doom-the-dark-ages-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpu-and-laptop-bundle)! Witness the creation of a legend as the Slayer takes on all of Hell and turns the tide of the war, now or on May 15th when *DOOM: The Dark Ages* launches globally, enhanced by RTX technology.\n\nGeForce RTX gamers will receive the definitive *DOOM: The Dark Ages* experience thanks to our technical partnership with id Software. Multiply frame rates on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs on average by 4X at 4K using [DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/). Double performance on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs using DLSS Frame Generation, and enhance image quality on all GeForce RTX GPUs with DLSS Super Resolution’s transformer AI model.\n\nAccelerate *DOOM: The Dark Ages*’ native idTech8 ray tracing technologies with GeForce RTX Ray Tracing Cores. Make gameplay even more responsive with NVIDIA Reflex. Shortly after launch, an update will introduce PC-exclusive path tracing, taking ray traced lighting to the next level on GeForce RTX GPUs thanks to DLSS Ray Reconstruction, which replaces traditional denoisers with a superior, unified AI model that enhances image quality and accelerates performance.\n\nBelow is a new, exclusive video showing you the day-one *DOOM: The Dark Ages* experience on a GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU, using Ultra settings, Reflex, and DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation\n\n[Video Link Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3q8taqRiGQ)\n\n# DOOM: The Dark Ages Is RTX ON\n\nDeveloped on the all-new idTech8 engine, *DOOM: The Dark Ages* runs natively in ray traced mode, rendering more immersive and spectacular scenes which feature full dynamic lighting with Ray-Traced Global Illumination and Ray-Traced Reflections.\n\nRay-traced global illumination lighting simulates real-world lighting to naturally illuminate and darken detail, and enables real-time lighting changes based on the properties of light cast from all light sources, and from dynamic elements, such as player and enemy weapons.\n\nRay-traced reflections, meanwhile, enhance suitably reflective surfaces, enabling them to mirror their surroundings, or to be more naturally shaded and illuminated, increasing image quality.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcjrbb6vij0f1.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&s=399a2218f6c4013dcfbde2f62cd3fdb4f0bd5ed6\n\n**Shortly after launch, a PC-exclusive** ***DOOM: The Dark Ages*** **update will add path tracing and DLSS Ray Reconstruction.**\n\n**Path tracing takes the quality of ray-traced lighting to the next level, reflecting additional detail and game elements on surfaces. NVIDIA Spatial Hash Radiance Cache (SHaRC) technology is leveraged to performantly compute path-traced light, while NVIDIA Shader Execution Reordering further accelerates performance on GeForce RTX GPUs.**\n\nTo ensure path tracing looks its absolute best, traditional denoisers are replaced on GeForce RTX GPUs with [DLSS Ray Reconstruction](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction/). This AI-based technique produces higher-quality images, with more detail, and greater stability, improving overall image quality.\n\nUsed synergistically, path tracing and DLSS Ray Reconstruction make *DOOM: The Dark Ages* levels more immersive, and its action more spectacular, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive experience.\n\n# DLSS 4 With Multi Frame Generation Multiplies Frame Rates\n\nGeForce RTX gamers cranking *DOOM: The Dark Ages*’ settings to the max can enable NVIDIA DLSS to ensure frame rates are at their fastest at each resolution.\n\nOur newest DLSS innovation, Multi Frame Generation, generates three additional frames per traditional frame, multiplying performance significantly, for the fastest gaming possible at the highest resolutions and detail levels.\n\nIn *DOOM: The Dark Ages*, in conjunction with DLSS Super Resolution, [DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/) accelerates performance by an average of 4X at 4K on the Ultra Preset. This massive boost enables GeForce RTX 5090 owners to experience *DOOM: The Dark Ages* maxed out at over 320 frames per second, GeForce RTX 5080 players at over 240 FPS, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti users at over 210 FPS, and GeForce RTX 5070 owners at over 170 FPS.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwvymc3zrj0f1.png?width=6666&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddb61c2303b9411caddf8a5ec61c007cd124c460\n\nAt 2560x1440, a 3.2X average performance multiplier enables high frame rate, max setting *DOOM: The Dark Ages* gameplay on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, ranging from over 180 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, up to 390 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5090.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yw5cselzrj0f1.png?width=6666&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd9b90ac9eb126adb278b86e12bd9ecfb5a5ae48\n\nAt 1920x1080, a 3.1X DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation multiplier ensures every GeForce RTX 50 Series gamer can experience *DOOM: The Dark Ages* maxed out at over 250 frames per second, and at up to 470 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5090.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d63x8i50sj0f1.png?width=6666&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfbabfc242f030ed430bdcc6c1120d1d0d4ce3e9\n\n***Gamers on RTX 50 Series with 8GB GPUs can enjoy DOOM: The Dark Ages at Ultra settings with high frame rates by setting \"Texture Pool Size\" to 1536 with minimal impact to image quality.***\n\nA similarly fast experience can be found on our newest GeForce RTX 50 Series laptops at 2560x1600 thanks to a 3.8X average DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation performance multiplier, enabling max setting gameplay at up to 270 frames per second on a mobile machine.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jho32t41sj0f1.png?width=6666&format=png&auto=webp&s=1887a7617b3f40f46fcd0a49789a7c7b06c302c3\n\nAt 1920x1080, a 3.3X average increase sees performance on GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPUs surpass 200 frames per second, and reaches 360 FPS on GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPUs, for a super fast mobile gaming experience.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pq2paal1sj0f1.png?width=6666&format=png&auto=webp&s=d61b6a362b5363997674ca0e469e72f61bb51729\n\nHigh frame rates reduce [PC latency](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/system-latency-optimization-guide/), making gameplay more responsive. To reduce latency even further, all GeForce RTX gamers can activate [NVIDIA Reflex](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/reflex/) in *DOOM: The Dark Ages*. This game-changing technology reduces PC latency on GeForce graphics cards, desktops, and laptops so your actions occur quicker, making games even more responsive, and more enjoyable.\n\nUsing DLSS and Reflex, *DOOM: The Dark Ages* is at its fastest and most responsive on GeForce RTX GPUs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wczod582sj0f1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=b36c888c28f2ee94a777b63bc3661687ac3eed7d\n\n# DOOM: The Dark Ages Game Ready Driver Available Now\n\nTo get your system game ready for *DOOM: The Dark Ages*, head to the Drivers tab of [NVIDIA app](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/) or [GeForce.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/) to download and install our [*DOOM: The Dark Ages* Game Ready Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/doom-the-dark-ages-geforce-game-ready-driver).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbzq416qjj0f1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9ee0fdbe48967f0d8ce6bb77fe5cf6ce6d092c1\n\n# GeForce RTX 50 Series Bundle Available Until May 21st\n\nUntil May 21st, as part of our [*DOOM: The Dark Ages* GeForce RTX 50 Series Bundle](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/doom-the-dark-ages-rtx-bundle/)\\*, get the Premium Edition of *DOOM: The Dark Ages* (a $99.99 value) with the purchase of a qualifying GeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, or 5070 desktop or graphics card, or a laptop with a GeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, or 5070 Laptop GPU.\n\nGet a head start on slaying demons with the Premium Edition, including up to 2-Day Early Access\\*\\* and the campaign DLC\\*\\*\\*.

At 40ms or more it’s very obvious there’s a delay before your controls respond, like there’s something wrong with the game and monitor.\n\nThe 8 gig limit just shouldn’t be offered in 2025.  16 gig minimum, especially since ram chips just don’t cost that much to the manufacturer to the point of charging $50 extra to the customer.  This is reminiscent of Apple gating ram differences for $100-$200 when it doesn’t cost that much to manufacture.",

While I have an RTX card, I have a sibling with a 1080 Ti, so maybe this could be big for them, and maybe games like Doom Dark Ages can work this way too. This could also help hold some people over while they wait for a reasonably price 22GB+ GPU to upgrade to, since Nvidia's current offerings are mostly vram starved at 12-16GB (except for 5060 Ti 16GB, which is actually the perfect amount for that card)",

Any card today is basically a huge generational leap from 1080Ti.\n\nAnd 16GB is perfectly fine for future -- you may surprisingly find pure RT games use less VRAM than raster due to less by-product for deferred rendering. Future AI driven texture compression will further reduce the VRAM usage by a lot.",

      "A 4080/5070 ti will likely be the minimum for a decent path tracing experience on this game.",
      "Save up and get the 5070 ti. 5060 Ti doesn’t have enough RT cores and 5070 doesn’t have enough VRAM.",
      "Safest option is to save for the 5070 Ti.\n\nBut in case that’s not an option, I would say that the 5070 with lower textures will be a better PT experience than the 5060 Ti with higher textures. The former will just have more FPS on average. This doesn’t excuse the 5070’s meager 12GB VRAM, but it’s the lesser evil within the context of PT.",

      "Any 40 or 50 series card can run Pathtracing… as with everything it’s just about what compromises you have to make. At DLSS Ultra Performance a lot less VRAM will be needed for example.",

      "60ti is capable of 1440p, you just might have to turn down a couple settings or use DLSS if you want giga high frame rates. Many benchmarks show the 5060ti 16gb can handle 1440p at above 60fps for many titles, just usually on high instead of ultra settings and that's before DLSS",

      "I've got a 12700k and 5070ti setup and 1440p Indiana Jones runs good on 1440p/4k  with path racing enabled though some of it will be down to MFG which doom the dark ages also has so I think you'll have some success, so the 5070 regular may cut it but i had a 3080ti prior and i kept hitting vram limits playing about with indiana jones seetings so i'd put my money in to 16gb card.\n\nThey both use the same game engine I do believe so a good preview would be seeing how it runs on indianna jones might be a preview how it will run on doom though they are different games so i wouldn't expect 1:1 matching",
      "I wasn’t satisfied with a 5060 Ti 16GB, 5070, and a 9070 the past three weeks of buying open-box cards.  Finally decided to spring for a 5070 Ti and am pretty content now.",

      "5070 would probably be more of a meaningful upgrade and you can find them around msrp now.  The 12gb vram is a downside, but it's fine for everything except a handful of newest games at max settings at 1440p.",
      "As someone who upgraded from a 3060TI to a 5080, I would say in my case it was worth it, mainly because I use a 4K TV as my Monitor, and wanted to have more frames at 4K than my 3060TI could give me. \n\nI’m honestly surprised that I was able to push my 3060TI as much as I did since I always used it at 4K, despite the card being more suited to 1080p/1440p. Would be able to get around 20-90FPS at 4K with DLSS, though it was never consistent.\n\nNow with my 5080, I can play at 4K (both native and with DLSS) and depending on game, get more consistent frames at around 90-120fps, likely more if I disable G-Sync and the FPS cap.\n\nI am not sure how a 5060TI would be compared to the 3060TI, as I see mixed and contradictory results and data when researching, but I would NOT recommend upgrading to that card to be worth it at all.",

      "The only hinderence with op i can see is their vram. They would see a good uplift if they are vram limited if they had a 16gb 5060ti, but yes lossless scaling is amazing. I use it on my rog ally.",

That's how much system memory you're using as frame buffer because your card can't handle it all. Once you start using that, performance suffers.",

I’ll run the same benchmarks on my old system and then post the percentage uplift here, for posterity. 😁",
      "Considering the next highest card the 5070 Ti is like $1100-1200+ where I'm at, even $650 for a 5060 Ti 16Gb was acceptable especially since dollars ain't what they used to be. There were a couple models for closer to $550 but they had that cut pcb and actual 8 lane, I didn't love the build. It was like $140 over MSRP but I'm not going to fuss about it.\n\nI just hate that they didn't make a real 5070 with 16Gb/18Gb to fill that giant gap to 5070 Ti. $350 would've been insanely cheap, especially if the 5070 Ti was still the same price it is now and there was just nothing in between.",

Keep in mind this isn't apples to apples GPU testing, it's just the difference between my old and new systems. But I am posting GPU-only benchmarks where they are available. I have to say that, especially with the overclock, a 5060 ti is a fantastic replacement for a 3060 ti!",

I remember I got my first black screen when I upgraded to 576.40 so I stayed at this driver. \n\nI did manage to send a kernel dump file before all of this though and someone from the driver team acknowldeged it and said this: \n\n>Thank you.  This black screen crash is related to shader cache crash and is a different issue I believe which should be fixed in our next driver scheduled for next month.  I’ll share this dmp file with the team but if you update your drivers and the issue returns with desktop apps, please send us that dmp file as that is not related to the shader cache bug.\n\nThis particular black screen crash when loading up a game is because of shader cache building issue on any game, be it in main menu or in-game asynchronously. \n\nNow black screens or signal loss(OS is still responsive in the background and audio plays if i connect the audio jack to motherboard) during normal desktop use could be something you're talking about related to WDDM, but again it happens on 576.40 and above. 576.28 is fine. I am on latest 24H2 26100.4188 build, release preview channel.\n\n>Tracking a strange issue with Windows 11 24H2 (WDDM) that may be related to *application triggered* black screens.\n\nCan you tell more about this?",

TBH, I just wanna play some games peacefully after a full day's work and this issue annoyed me for a week so I'm hesitant to upgrade and test as everything is fine for now in 576.28.

It's also great for other path tracing games like Cyberpunk, especially since it has multi-frame gen to hit 200+ FPS.\n\nAt 1080p, the 5070 has roughly the same performance as the 5090 at 4k. I honestly can't recommend it highly enough for 1080p gaming, since the VRAM won't be an issue, plus it's obviously overpowered for non-PT games since it can handle PT, so you won't need to upgrade for a very long time.\n\nIf you play at 1440p, you want the 5080.

Nor should any cards be affected that were produced more recently: “The production anomaly has been corrected,” he says****. In case you’re wondering, he also told us that* ***Nvidia was not aware of these issues before it launched these GPUs.***\n\n**Here's NVIDIA's Full Amended Statement**:\n\n>*We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified.

The production anomaly has been corrected.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Quick Clarification from me:**\n\nIn the response above, NVIDIA mentioned \"one fewer ROP\". In this case, they are referring to the Raster Operation partition. One (1) Raster Operation partition contains the eight (8) missing ROP units.\n\nAlso, if you want to check your 50 Series cards with [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/), below is the **correct** ROPs amounts from [Blackwell whitepaper](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf):\n\n* **RTX 5090** = 176 ROPs (Affected units have 168 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5080 =** 112 ROPs (Affected units have 104 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** = 96 ROPs (Affected units have 88 ROPs)\n\nWe have also seen [someone](https://reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1iwi18d/rtx_5080_missing_rops/) with 8 missing ROPs on his RTX 5080 as well. While the statement from NVIDIA did not mention RTX 5080, if you do have the same issue with any of the 50 Series cards, the path forward is the same and it is to **contact board manufacturers and** **RMA the card**",

Nor should any cards be affected that were produced more recently: “The production anomaly has been corrected,” he says****. In case you’re wondering, he also told us that* ***Nvidia was not aware of these issues before it launched these GPUs.***\n\n**Here's NVIDIA's Full Amended Statement**:\n\n>*We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.*\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Quick Clarification from me:**\n\nIn the response above, NVIDIA mentioned \"one fewer ROP\". In this case, they are **referring to the Raster Operation partition**. **One (1) Raster Operation partition contains the eight (8) missing ROP units**.\n\nAlso, if you want to check your 50 Series cards with [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/), below is the **correct** ROPs amounts from [Blackwell whitepaper](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf):\n\n* **RTX 5090/5090D** = 176 ROPs (Affected units have 168 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5080 =** 112 ROPs (Affected units have 104 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** = 96 ROPs (Affected units have 88 ROPs)",

Where did they get the 0.5% of cards effected? Absolutely out of their ass.\n\nThey either knew, or didn't know and both options are terrible for a \"High-End\" product released by the best company. This, the cables, the poor drivers bricking PC's, fake msrp, fake frames, fires. They have went downhill and need to wake tf up. Reduce the price of cards, fix the quality aspect of your products and be a good monopoly for once.",
      "If Nvidia knows which production defect caused this as some people have speculated, why isn't there communication saying that people who purchased the affected units will be contacted for a refund or replacement rather having to ask?  What percentage of people who end up with a Nvidia GPU have a clue what GPU-Z is?  How was the company able to very rapidly respond with a percentage of cards affected without prior knowledge of the issue?  The most likely explanation is seeming like someone at Nvidia figured out you can ship defective products and most customers will never notice.  I thought we had moved on from the GTX 970 VRAM era shenanigans given the market cap of this company now.  If mainstream media (not tech outlets) get onto this it will not be a great look, even if 85% of revenue is from sources other than gaming now.",
      "If they truly did not know about this, then that is actually scarily bad QA from company of Nvidia's size...\n\n\nBut I doubt that. Probably just pushed all the faulty chips out there in hopes people wouldn't notice or can't be bothered to RMA. Or to improve the already ridiculously bad supply, even if temporarily.\n\n\nWhat a joke this company has become.",

      "I'd wager that the majority of consumers are not aware of this issue.",
      "Interesting that NVIDIA has chosen not to offer even an apology for any of this. Just \"too bad, try your luck with RMA.\"\n\nI wonder if they even bothered to let the board partners know that they'll be needing to process these claims.",
      "Why couldn’t the error be the other way around",
      "Since people DM me about the missing ROP, here is what MSI answered me yesterday :\n\n*We're sorry to hear that you're experiencing an issue with your MSI component, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.*   \n*For your convenience, please note that the warranty is exclusively offered through our authorized stores and resellers. To make a warranty claim and have your unit repaired, replaced, or refunded (depending on the available solutions), we kindly request you to contact the store where the item was purchased. They are well equipped to handle warranty claims and will guide you through the process seamlessly.*  \n*Your satisfaction is our top priority, and we want to ensure that you receive the best possible support and service for your MSI product.*  \n*If you have any further questions or require additional assistance, please feel free to reach out to our customer support team.*\n\nOf course I also contacted the reseller but no response so far. Which is strange because they usually answer very quickly.  \nI assume they are waiting for Nvidia/MSI directives about what they may or may not do regarding the warranty / replacement. I'll let you know.\n\nEDIT : The online reseller just contacted me, saying they will replace the card but they have no stock to do so at the moment. They suggest I keep the card for \"a while\" until they got more stock.\n\nSo I guess I'm keeping it for a few months or more. Well at least I'm gonna get a new card later so that's something.",
      "This is a bad look at every angle and these gpus are $2000 premium should have better quality control",
      "4% according to Nvidia. Tests have shown as high as 11%",
      "In otherwords its wider spread than they claim and they knowingly sold faulty dies.\n\nLook back prior to releasing, there was a report on bad batches of wafers, they knew before release and chose to sell them anyway.\n\nAugust last year, reports of low packaging yield threatening release time tables.\n\nThey knew, and they knowingly sold defective dies to meet their release dates.",
      "Easy. What QC are you talking about?",
      "I really hope this is sarcasm.",
      "I am imagining they had such low stock of GPUs for the launch that somebody greenlighted purposely allowing defective cards through because they were gambling that having slightly more stock at launch would be less harmful to reputation and bottom line than some people having defective cards that they can RMA later once there's slightly more stock available.\n\nit sounds insane but i can't imagine a realistic scenario where these defective GPUs went through QA at TSMC and then at Nvidia and then at AIB partners with this problem and still made it to store shelves."

Undercutting it by $100 for next-gen midrange is pretty solid with the additional feature set if you’re in the large group that doesn’t need the VRAM.

They’re not being sold at MSRP right now, and it’s not a real next-gen value shakeup to the market, but they were *supposed* to provide a better value proposition, and they will once this stock fiasco is over.\n\n> 50 series is terrible\n\nThat’s subjective. Not a lot of people have 40 series cards, if you’re not buying a new card every generation (which only a very few vocal minority are and rich people), it has the potential to be an enticing upgrade at MSRP.\n\nIt’s a performance increase at a cheaper price from last gen.

It’s barely an upgrade over the 4070 Ti Super going from the available specs. 6% more cores and power consumption,~~a little more L2 cache~~, but lower clock speeds. If the scaling is the same as with 80 and 90 tier, that should translate to a 6% to 10% performance increase - ~~unless the cache does some incredibly heavy lifting here.~~\n\nEDIT: According to Nvidias own documentation there isn’t even a cache increase. That’s a mistake in techpowerups database.\n\nAccording to techpowerup’s database the 5070Ti actually has lower texture rate and fp16 performance than the 4070TiS.

      "hopefuly amd can keep the price of 5070ti in check as the 9070XT should actually somewhat compete with it. It might even be beneficial to wait with 5070ti purchase until amd launches their cards, i could see a scenario where 5070ti costs like $900+ for the first few weeks, but drops back to $750-850 range once amd releases their cards. I dont think nvidia can afford the same shenanigans as they are doing right now with 5090 and 5080, and 5070ti should be available for everyone who wants it and costs close to msrp. Hopefuly.",

      "Yeah no reason it shouldn't be",
      "fuck, now they are going to sell at 4080 price",
      "Would this be a good card for 4k 60hz?",
      "This is totally by design. No fe models means a higher cost from a partner. Then you’re a just a little bit away from a 5080, so why not spend a little more? This is Nvidia just strategically squeezing its customers to milk every last ounce of money from them.",

      "Can you say more about your benchmark? It's new to me.",
      "because if the actual frame rate was 30 then it'll feel dogshit to play no matter how many jello frames you generate",
      "Does your bench have an option to compare against the same graphics card / similar systems? I'm gonna give it a download later tonight.",
      "Yeah, but seems hardly surprising given the very modest uplift that the 5080 has over the 4080/4080S. This whole generation is very disappointing if you aren't interested in frame generation, and given the same TSMC 4N fabrication process we couldn't expect much of a gain without drastic increases in power consumption.\n\nI am sure I will be happy with a 5070 Ti when I eventually get one this year, but I am upgrading from a 3060 Ti so the difference will be huge. Just annoying that we had a pretty disappointing uplift with the 40XX cards, and then an even worse uplift with the 50XX cards. Hopefully I will actually like the frame gen and not really notice the artifacting or added latency for those games I might want to max out.",

This model became available on amazon today in the UK,  paid MSRP at £729 😁 \n the german is at 960 euros right now, 100 euro more expensive than the UK's but the price you got is good, still no 5070TIs go for £760 here!\n\nWeird thing is I was away all day and found out about it 12+ hours after it became available and still didn't go out of stock quickly, not sure why based on the craziness  I've seen for the past 1.5 months and my failed attempts to snatch one 😅\nThere are some weird stuff with the specs like gddr6x ! And the wrong model number but I'm not too worried since it's sold directly from MSI store and I assume these are just typos..\n\nWith regards to fan noise etc, I'm not willing to pay £900+ for better fans, and this will sure be better than my zephyrs g15 fans at 8800 rpm\n\nSo happy! Knock on wood it arrives safely with all its ROPs, estimated delivery in 3 weeks",
      "I wonder how it compares to the ventus model (which is quite loud without a power limit and a fan curve)",
      "Habe eine Shadow 5070 ti für 860€ direkt bei msi gekauft",
      "First feedback on the 5070 Ti Shadow: can confirm that it’s basically a Ventus in black. Using FurMark, the card reaches 71 degrees Celsius at max power of 300W. Clock mhz somewhat higher than a Ventus but that may just be luck (silicon lottery). The card is about the same noise at 40db, similar to the Ventus. I am happy with it as it fits nicely into my all black build and in case you get the card at MSRP (879€ in Germany incl. taxes) it’s a really good bargain especially if you play using a headset and thus don’t need silent fans.",
      "This is from the official MSI store vendor listing on Amazon. Plus I'm going to definitely be home the day that package is coming to my door.",
      "I'm surprised how long it is staying in stock it must be a large shipment arriving probably what should of been there at launch lol at MSRP the 5070Ti is great value I ordered one my self so hopefully they are decent",
      "Oh nice! Says delivery on 7th April for me but still decided to go for it considering no other models are anywhere close to MSRP.",
      "Probably close to the Ventus. This was supposed to be a reply to [u/Educational-Party-97](https://www.reddit.com/user/Educational-Party-97/) but they apparently blocked me.",
      "That part can be a bit deceiving - any product listed on Amazon manufactured by a certain company will link to that company storefront. What you want to look for is whether it is sold and shipped by Amazon. \n\n\nShould show that near add to cart/buy now, and your order should confirm that if you go check it out. \n\n\nI hate to be a person who rains on someone's parade especially when they are happy they scored a card - but lately people have been creating new Amazon seller accounts and listing \"available GPUs\" at MSRP to trick people into buying. Please confirm this is not the case. \n\n\nSorry I couldn't not give you a heads up. Hope everything is as it should be. If you discover it was not sold by Amazon and if the seller account is new, I'd cancel it."

    "selftext": "# GeForce RTX 5070 Ti reviews are up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rt7z75u3k3ke1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7e929e87625c6e909d04c0472abaf71f65a5e00\n\n# Below is the compilation of all the reviews that have been posted so far. I will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links. This will be sorted alphabetically.\n\n# Written Articles\n\n# [Babeltechreviews](https://babeltechreviews.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-asus-prime-edition/)\n\n>The Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti is a well-balanced GPU that delivers strong performance, particularly at **1440p and high-refresh 1080p gaming**. Its **efficient design, improved cooling, and significant performance gains** over the RTX 3070 and 4070 make it a compelling upgrade for gamers still on older-generation cards. **DLSS 4 support** further enhances its longevity, allowing for improved frame rates in demanding titles, making it a forward-thinking choice for those planning to keep their system for years to come.\n\n>However, pricing and availability are the biggest concerns surrounding the RTX 5070 Ti. While Nvidia has set an MSRP of $749, market conditions, tariffs, and limited stock often push the actual retail price higher. With early reports indicating that some models will land closer to $899 or more, the value proposition erodes. There are cards at launch at the MSRP of $749.99 and if you can snag one, we would recommend it. At the higher price points, an RTX 4080—especially if discounted or available second-hand—becomes a better buy due to its **higher VRAM capacity, better raw performance, and increased longevity for 4K gaming**. The only other factor would be how important DLSS 4 is for you.\n\n>Gamers should truly evaluate their **needs, budget, and resolution targets** before deciding, as AMD’s offerings could provide **better price-to-performance in pure rasterized gaming scenarios**. It goes without saying that the inflated pricing right now should be a huge stopping point for many; if you can wait, it would be best to look for a card near MSRP and not pay the scalper pricing.\n\n>Ultimately, the RTX 5070 Ti is **a fantastic card, but only if it remains at or near MSRP**. If prices **creep toward $900**, it loses appeal, especially when AMD’s alternatives and Nvidia’s own **RTX 4080-class GPUs** offer **better raw performance per dollar**. Gamers should watch for sales, check AMD’s competitive pricing, and weigh whether DLSS 4 and ray tracing enhancements justify the cost over alternative GPUs.\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlWmYg7Vr3Q&pp=ygUPZGlnaXRhbCBmb3VuZHJ5)\n\n>With our testing complete, the RTX 5070 Ti does enough to earn a recommendation. In short, you're getting a 16 percent improvement over the RTX 4070 Ti for $50 less - in theory - or a more measly seven percent advantage over the 4070 Ti Super. Add on frame generation and a few other niceties like DisplayPort 2.1, and the value proposition has at least improved over the last-gen card... though it's clear that the revised design and GDDR7 don't account for anywhere near the sort of gen-on-gen boost you get from a more substantial change, such as a shift to a new process process node.\n\n>In terms of our table of overall performance from 17 games tested, it's no surprise to see the 5090, 4090 and 5080 at the top across all resolutions. There's not much to divide the 4080 Super, 4080 and 5070 Ti too, with the outgoing 4070 Ti Super being no slouch either. It's interesting to note that even at 1080p, the close grouping of products around the 5070 Ti remains in place - it's only really the 4090 and 5090 that lose ground.\n\n>In common with RTX 5080, we're looking at another upwards bump in pure performance terms, though this time the gap between the new card and its older counterpart is much tighter, so who would I recommend this product to? Well, depending on resolution, you're looking at anything from a 31 to 33 percent general uplift in performance against the classic RTX 3080. Combined with the extra memory and the features of DLSS 4, I'd consider that the kind of threshold that's worth an upgrade, especially as you'll be able to more easily migrate into the full RT path tracing experience on a number of games which will prove more challenging on 3080-class hardware.\n\n>In terms of recommendations, the same applies if you have any of the higher end RDNA 2 cards, like 6800 XT, for example. Similarly, if you're still on a Turing-class 20 series card, you'll see a gigantic improvement here from the likes of 2080, 2070 Super and even 2080 Ti.\n\n>The question is, of course, whether the value calculations we've made are actually applicable. Nvidia sent over a list of cards promised to be at MSRP in the US and UK - which we've duly reproduced on our \"[where to buy RTX 5070 Ti](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-where-to-buy-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-uk-us-links)\" page - but we won't know until launch day how accessible they'll be.\n\n# [eTeknix Article](https://www.eteknix.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-graphics-card-review/)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2dqGTJ_Hj4)\n\n>First and foremost, the RTX 5070 Ti is a big step up for those still on an RTX 3070 Ti, in some cases offering a massive 60–70% performance uplift in rasterisation and over 100% in ray tracing, making it one of the most substantial generational jumps we’ve seen for this class of GPU. More importantly, it doubles the VRAM to 16GB of GDDR7 on a 256-bit bus, solving one of the biggest complaints about the 3070 Ti’s limited 8GB frame buffer, which has clearly started to show its age in modern titles.\n\n>Compared to the RTX 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti SUPER, the 5070 Ti still brings noticeable improvements, but the margins aren’t as dramatic. With around 17% uplifts over the 4070 Ti and around 9% over the 4070 Ti SUPER, it doesn’t necessarily make those cards obsolete, but it does offer a meaningful performance-per-pound advantage—especially if you skipped the 40 series and are looking for the best bang for your buck in the 70-class segment. Though, as mentioned, pricing is a bit out of whack anyway, and that’s a sore subject.\n\n>The pricing should have made the 5070 Ti a killer option, and at the announced MSRP of £749, this GPU easily justifies itself, slotting in close to the 4080 series in performance while staying significantly cheaper. It also comes with NVIDIA’s latest technologies like DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation (MFG), which dramatically improves performance and, along with Reflex, reduces latency, but only in supported titles. Though you could argue that’s better than what the competition are doing right now by turning unplayable frame rates at 4K with ray tracing into something smooth and responsive, all while maintaining lower latency than native rendering.\n\n>Now, the big problem is that MSRP pricing never lasts, and NVIDIA’s recent track record with the 5080 and 5090 tells us that the 5070 Ti is unlikely to be found at £749 for long, if at all. We’ve already seen retailers listing it at £899, which puts it in a very different competitive position. If it lands closer to £899–£999, suddenly the 4080 series and AMD’s 9000 series cards become much more attractive alternatives. But even then, I, like many others, am frustrated. It seems long gone are the days where a 70 Ti class would cost you £599 like the 3070 Ti, and you’d get it for that price. That really is the frustrating part, as the 5070 Ti is a great GPU. It has strong generational performance if you’re willing to skip a generation, excellent ray tracing, if you’re willing to skip a generation, and better upscaling capabilities, but if NVIDIA adds DLSS 4 to the 40 series, then again, if you skip a generation.\n\n>Overall, its value depends entirely on real-world pricing. If it stays close to MSRP, it’s a good, solid upgrade for those moving from the 3070 Ti or even a 4070 Ti user looking for extra power without stepping into flagship pricing and wanting to harness the latest tech. But if inflated pricing and scalping take hold, it loses its edge, making it a tougher sell in an already crowded GPU market. And with AMD’s 9000 series on the horizon, NVIDIA and their partners, through both AIBs and retail, may need to do some rethinking.\n\n>For now, the RTX 5070 Ti delivers on its promise of being a strong next-gen option, and if you can get it at MSRP, it’s a solid buy. But as we’ve seen before, that’s a big “if”, and it’s something we’ll be watching closely in the coming weeks. Let me know what you think in the comments section below. Will you be upgrading from the 30 series? Are you already on a 40 series GPU and are looking to upgrade, but now maybe don’t see the point? Your feedback would be good to see.\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-16g-ventus-3x-oc-review/)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti arrives as the third release in NVIDIA’s RTX 5000 series, highlighting a blend of raw raster horsepower and AI-augmented features like DLSS4 and Multi Frame Generation (MFG). Many gamers stay cautious about these AI-driven additions, preferring straightforward rasterization for a more accurate picture. This scepticism is understandable since the older RTX 4000 series, already equipped with DLSS 3.5, delivers solid frame rates and remains competitive. As NVIDIA moves deeper into the mid-range of the 5000 lineup, the performance gap compared to the previous generation narrows, making some wonder if an upgrade is worthwhile if they mainly value traditional rendering. NVIDIA continues to emphasize AI acceleration, a trend we mentioned with the RTX 5090 release. While this approach feels visionary, a sizeable portion of the gaming community believes it’s advancing faster than the market can fully embrace. Still, the RTX 5000 cards offer notable gains in Ray Tracing and the new Neural Shading feature, both of which boost lighting realism and render scenes at higher resolutions. In games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2, Ray Tracing combined with DLSS4/MFG can drive frame rates to impressive levels. However, that performance can demand a lot of power and efficient cooling. Like its siblings, the RTX 5070 Ti needs a robust power supply and good case airflow. There’s also potential for manual tuning and overclocking, which might add around five percent more performance—though silicon quality and thermals can limit those gains. In raw power terms, the RTX 5070 Ti brings a modest boost alongside higher energy demands and a heftier price tag. For players who simply want traditional frame rates without AI enhancements, it might not feel like a huge leap over a premium 4000 series card. On the horizon, AMD has something new planned as well, leaving many to wonder how that will stack up. For now, the 4000 series remains a solid option, especially with DLSS 3.5 in its corner. NVIDIA’s challenge lies in convincing enthusiasts that AI-boosted frames don’t sacrifice image quality or add unwanted latency. MSI steps in with its Ventus version of the RTX 5070 Ti, featuring a reinforced support bracket for added stability and a 12V-2×6 adapter cable for power. The Ventus 3X cooler generally keeps noise(reasonably) in check, though actual temperatures vary per build. These partner cards rarely stray far from reference specs but can draw attention from buyers who prefer a specific brand or design. As for the rumored 749-dollar price tag, it’s unclear if that will hold once it hits store shelves, but MSI seems to have delivered a solid offering at that MSRP. In the end, upgrading from a 4070 Ti may not be necessary for most users. Those moving up from the RTX 3000 series or older, however, might find enough reasons to make the jump\n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/asus-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-prime-review)\n\n>At this point, we suspect all of your understand NVIDIA’s M.O. with the GeForce RTX 50 series. Traditional rasterization performance was increased over the previous generation, but not to the same extent as past releases. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti leapfrogged the RTX 3070 Ti with traditional raster, whereas the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is about +/-30% faster than [the RTX 4070 Ti](https://hothardware.com/reviews/asus-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-super-review). When its new RTX Neural Rendering features and DLSS 4 multi-frame gen are employed, however, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti can put up much higher framerates than any previous-gen card – look to our Cyberpunk 2077 benchmarks to see the upside performance that's on tap. Whether you count those generated frames as additional performance is up for debate for some of you, but that fact is, every GPU manufacturer is reaching a point of diminishing returns with traditional rasterization within the limitations of current manufacturing processes, so using [AI to generate frames](https://hothardware.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-multi-frame-gen-and-ton-of-fixes) has a much more significant impact on the smoothness of on-screen animation. This topic merits a deeper discussion on its own, and is something all gamers and enthusiasts should ponder\n\n>That said, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is an upgrade over the previous generation nonetheless. It’s faster across the board in our game tests and AI and creator workloads perform better on it as well. If you’ve got an RTX 40 series card, however, the significance of that upgrade is probably not motivation enough to take the leap. If you’ve got a mainstream RTX 30-series card, however, it’s a different story. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a monster upgrade over the RTX 3070 Ti, not only for its updated GPU architecture but also for its 16GB GDDR7 frame buffer.\n\n>At an MSRP of $749, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti arrives at a $150 higher MSRP than [the RTX 3070 Ti](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-and-benchmarks), but $50 lower than the RTX 4070 Ti. If you’ve got an older GPU and are contemplating an upgrade, but don’t have a G or more to spend, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is worth a look. It’s got a bleeding-edge feature set, it's likely highly tweakable for overclocking, and DLSS 4 with multi-frame gen will only get more pervasive over time. There are some other new GPUs on the horizon though, [from both AMD](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-radeon-rx-9070-launch-event-howto-watch-what-expect) and NVIDIA, so perhaps sit tight for a bit to better understand the entire consumer graphics card landscape before parting with your hard-earned cash.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-as-msrp-card-in-test-interesting-chip-for-gamers-but-ventus-comes-from-ventilator/)\n\n>The RTX 5070 Ti offers strong performance in current AAA titles and is particularly optimized for 1440p gaming, while still achieving smooth frame rates in 4K with appropriate detail levels. Without ray tracing, it is around 12% ahead of the RTX 4070 Ti Super in WQHD and offers sufficient reserves for memory-intensive titles thanks to the high memory bandwidth of 896 GB/s. In Full HD, however, the CPU is often limited, which puts the performance advantages over the previous generation into perspective.\n\n>With active ray tracing, the demands on the GPU increase considerably. In native resolution without DLSS, the frame rates in demanding games sometimes fall below the 60 FPS mark. However, DLSS 3 and especially DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation (MFG) noticeably improve performance. The latter not only provides additional frames, but also optimizes frame pacing, resulting in more harmonious image reproduction. The efficiency of the tensor cores, which achieve almost native picture quality thanks to improved ray reconstruction technologies, is particularly evident in combination with patch tracing.\n\n>The MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus delivers solid performance in classic raster graphics scenarios and is ideal for WQHD gaming. Higher detail levels are possible in 4K, but not always at a stable 60 FPS, which is why upscaling technologies are often required. Compared to the RTX 4070 Ti Super with a nice factory OC, there is an average increase in performance of around 12% (around 16% better than a MSRP card), with CPU limitations in lower resolutions partially reducing the difference.\n\n>With ray tracing enabled, the MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus shows its strengths in combination with DLSS 4. The new multi-frame generation and ray reconstruction in particular enable playable frame rates, even in patch tracing scenarios, without any significant loss of quality. Compared to the previous generation, there is a significant leap forward here, especially in 4K with AI optimizations activated. The Ventus cooler represents a compromise between cost and performance. While temperatures are well controlled, the noise level under load is higher than that of high-end models. Overall, the MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus as an MSRP card remains an attractive choice for users who are looking for a powerful mid-range GPU with modern technology, but can live with small compromises in terms of cooling performance and noise.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/msi-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x-oc-review/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnHaarxf7pg)\n\n>As the third RTX 50 series GPU to hit the market, today we have analysed **Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti**. It's been fascinating to see what sort of performance is on offer at the claimed £729/$749 MSRP, given the [RTX 5080](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-efficiency-gains-but-a-performance-letdown/) and [RTX 5090](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-ray-tracing-dlss-4-and-raw-power-explored/) are eye-wateringly expensive.\n\n>Its price – and name, of course! – means the RTX 5070 Ti is positioned as the direct successor to the [RTX 4070 Ti Super](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-super-review-ft-msi/), and the performance gains follow a similar trend to what we saw when comparing the RTX 5080 to the RTX 4080 Super. In short, we're looking at a 12% average performance boost at 4K, while it's 5% slower than the RTX 4080 Super and 7% faster than AMD's RX 7900 XT.\n\n>The RTX 5070 Ti is certainly capable of 4K gaming, especially if you enable upscaling, but it wouldn't surprise me if most prospective buyers were planning on pairing it with a high refresh 1440p screen. At that resolution, the relative gains over the 4070 Ti Super do shrink to just 9% on average, while it's 6% slower than the 4080 Super, but still faster than the RX 7900 XT by 5%.\n\n>When enabling ray tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti out-performs AMD's current flagship, the RX 7900 XTX, delivering performance that's 32% better, an expected result given Nvidia's dominance in this area. Scaling is otherwise very similar when compared to Nvidia's own GPUs though, as the RTX 5070 Ti is still 12% faster than the 4070 Ti Super at 4K – the exact same margin observed in rasterisation performance.\n\n>Those sorts of performance gains gen-on-gen are hardly cause for wild celebration, but I do believe there's more reason to be positive about the RTX 5070 Ti than there was for the RTX 5080. For one, this new Blackwell GPU is 15% slower than its bigger brother, yet the MSRP is 25% lower, so that makes the RTX 5070 Ti the best value 50 series GPU yet.\n\n>Additionally, it gets a lot closer to the RTX 4080 Super than the RTX 5080 did to the 4090. It's still not *quite* there, being 5% slower on average, but the differences are even smaller in certain games – and the thought of circa-4080 Super performance for £729 doesn't sound too bad.\n\n>However, I was surprised to see a backwards step when it comes to efficiency. Nvidia officially rates the RTX 5070 Ti for 300W, though over my testing it averaged 283W at 4K. The RTX 5080 only drew 10W more on average however, and in fact I actually saw higher power draw from the 5070 Ti in certain games. I'd theorise that, as a cutdown GB203 die, RTX 5070 Ti could be lower quality silicon so it requires a more aggressive voltage/frequency curve, but it's hard to say for definite.\n\n>In any case, power draw being so close to the RTX 5080 while performing worse means that efficiency has regressed, with the 5070 Ti offering performance per Watt that's 13% lower. It's not the direction we would expect, as usually the lower-power GPUs are more efficient, so it'll be fascinating to see how the RTX 5070 (non-Ti) performs in this regard.\n\n# [LanOC](https://lanoc.org/review/video-cards/9143-asus-prime-rtx-5070-ti)\n\n>For performance, the Prime RTX 5070 Ti trades blows with the RTX 4080 and 4080 SUPER depending on the type of test. My averaged in game results had it out ahead just slightly. But as a whole DX 11 and Ray Tracing/DLSS results will have the Prime RTX 5070 Ti faster and in base DX12 tests it will fall behind the 4080. I would have liked to of seen this be at least consistently ahead of both of the RTX 4080 models. Overall that still does translate to being able to throw anything at it at 1440p and you can play at 4k in some situations. The Prime RTX 5070 Ti cooler was impressive in its noise tests, punching way above its weight class there. For cooling it did okay but Asus had an aggressive fan profile to do that, thankfully given the noise performance they could do that without it being too loud. Like with the other 50 Series cards, DLSS 4 performance was impressive and the changes Nvidia has made to DLSS have also improved the smoothness and picture when gaming with DLSS.\n\n>For pricing, as always pricing at launch is subject to change quickly. The launch MSRP of the RTX 5070 Ti and with the Prime RTX 5070 Ti tested is $749 so that is what I have to go by here. But we all know that cards at those price points are hard to come by and the more expensive overclocked cards will be what you will more often find assuming you can find them at all. We have just had tariffs that have changed GPU pricing across the board and with that I have updated our 3dMark Time Spy Extreme score per dollar chart that is above. At the MSRP the Prime RTX 5070 Ti is about as good as you can get right now for anything targeting 1440p or 4k gaming. I know a lot of people will be looking at how the RTX 5070 Ti compares with the RTX 4080 and RTX 4080 SUPER and MSRP for MSRP the $749 MSRP is still much better than the $1199 for the original RTX 4080 and $999 of the RTX 4080 SUPER and frankly, both cards are even more expensive than that to get right now if you can find them at all. With that in mind, the Prime RTX 5070 Ti competing with those cards is an improvement at the $750 price point but depending on the price we see overclocked cards that can change quickly.\n\n# [PC World Article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2612343/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review.html)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v7KboWkdu0)\n\n>If you want a high-performance graphics card capable of flying through 1440p and 4K gaming, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a no-brainer among currently available options. Gaming only gets better once you flip on Multi Frame Generation in 75 supported games and apps – the visual smoothness it provides is truly transformative, even if you’re coming from a 4080 Super already. Just ask Adam!\n\n>I wouldn’t recommend buying the RTX 5070 Ti if you’ve already got a comparable RTX 40-series card. But if you’re coming from the 30-series or prior, and willing to hold your nose over *how much more* graphics cards cost now – the [RTX 3070 Ti](https://www.pcworld.com/article/394671/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review.html) cost $600 and the [2070 Super cost $500](https://www.pcworld.com/article/397702/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-super-rtx-2070-super-review.html), before inflation – you’ll love the RTX 5070 Ti. The jump forward in raw performance alone is worth it, and then adding MFG on top (in dozens of supported titles) can make your games feel like a whole new experience.\n\n>With a roughly 25 percent leap in performance *plus* Multi Frame Gen, for $50 less than its predecessor, the RTX 5070 Ti offers a compelling all-around package – one that, unfortunately, the RTX 5080 didn’t quite nail. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is absolutely the enthusiast-grade graphics card I’d buy right now if I were shopping around… though you may want to see what AMD’s imminent Radeon RX 9070 XT offers when it hits the streets in early March.\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x/)\n\n>At 4K resolution, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 28% performance uplift over the RTX 4070 Ti, which is pretty good for a gen-over-gen improvement. While it's not as big as the RTX 5090, which is 36% faster than the RTX 4090, it's definitely better than the 15% that we got on RTX 5080 a few weeks ago. Just like with RTX 5090, NVIDIA achieves their \"twice the performance every second generation\" rule: the RTX 5070 Ti is twice as fast as the RTX 3070 Ti. This means the card matches performance of the RTX 4080 and RTX 4080 Super, and it's also beating AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX flagship by a wafer-thin margin. Impressive—NVIDIA's 3rd card in the lineup beats AMD's #1. And this is with pure rasterization—once you turn on ray tracing, the gap gets much bigger.\n\n>For this launch, NVIDIA provided us with the MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus OC, which, as the name reveals, is a factory overclocked card. This means that it has a small performance advantage—all the other comparison cards in our tests are clocked at reference. So, if you plan on buying a baseline card, subtract a percent or two from our performance numbers. Once cards appear in the market I will buy a pure base clock card, for comparisons in future reviews. There is no Founders Edition for the RTX 5070 Ti.\n\n>While RTX 5070 Ti is a very decent card for gaming at 4K, it's not a fire-and-forget solution. There are several titles that run at less than 60 FPS when maxed out (without RT and upscaling). I'd say RTX 5080 is a better choice for demanding 4K gaming, but considering the price differences, I think lowering details slightly or using upscaling / frame generation is a very reasonable approach. For 1440p, the RTX 5070 Ti is awesome, here it can achieve excellent frame rates and will be able to drive high-refresh-rate displays very well.\n\n>NVIDIA's MSRP for the RTX 5070 Ti Series is $750, which is very reasonable for the performance you're getting. Actually, this MSRP is $50 lower than the $800 price point that both the 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti Super launched at. There has been lots of controversy about fake MSRPs, and this has been going on for years now, so do expect higher prices in stores. The primary driver for this is supply and demand, if everybody wants a product, its supply won't be sufficient and prices will go up. For the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 supply was very low, too, making the situation even worse. I've plotted various alternative price points in our price/performance charts, reaching up to $1100, which, according to some early postings might end up being a realistic price point. We'll know more tomorrow, when sales go up.\n\n>MSI's RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X is priced at the NVIDIA MSRP, which is nice (as long as it's true and there's supply). Since there is no Founders Edition this time, there really isn't a baseline to compare to. Today we also tested the Galax RTX 5070 Ti 1-Click OC, which is MSRP as well, but comes with a much better cooler and much better noise levels. Still, the Ventus is definitely not bad. It is able to deliver the full RTX 5070 Ti experience, just with a little bit higher noise levels out of the box. Considering that, I'm having serious doubts whether I would be willing to spend, +$200, +$300 or even more for any custom design—we've seen pricing like that on some RTX 5070 Ti cards! Maybe $50-70 for a better cooler that runs really quiet, but that's about it.\n\n>There really isn't any alternative to the 5070 Ti in this segment, and NVIDIA knows that, and they designed the card with that in mind. No reason to give you +50% of anything if there's no competing product. AMD's flagship, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX currently sells for $820, with less performance, especially in RT, higher power draw and no DLSS. The RTX 4080 and 4080 Super are priced at around $1000 these days—no reason to buy them unless they are heavily discounted and end up below 5070 Ti pricing. What else is there? RTX 4090? Super expensive because people buy them for AI. RTX 5080 and 5090? Sold out, scalped to several thousand dollars. Let's hope that supply of RTX 5070 Ti is better and gamers can actually get their hands on these new cards.\n\n>AMD is set to release the Radeon RX 9070 Series shortly, but it probably won't match the performance of the RTX 5070 Ti. Instead, it seems it will be more comparable to the RTX 5070, which is also expected to be released soon. While these new cards cannot rival the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of performance, they are likely to be priced more competitively due to increased competition in this market segment.\n\n# [The FPS Review](https://www.thefpsreview.com/2025/02/19/asus-prime-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-video-card-review/)\n\n>**In raster performance**: Alan Wake 2 11%, Black Myth Wukong 13%, Cyberpunk 2077 9%, Dying Light 2 16%, F1 24 3%, Horizon Forbidden West 7%, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle 6%, Kingdom Come Deliverance II 13%, Stalker 2 7%, Star Wars Outlaws 6%.\n\n>If we take an average of those percentages, then in raster the average uplift of the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti over the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is **9%**. The highest peak was 16%, the lowest valley was 3%.\n\n>**In Ray Tracing performance**: Alan Wake 2 13%, Black Myth Wukong 14%, Cyberpunk 2077 11%, Dying Light 2 15%, F1 24 5%, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle 13%, Star Wars Outlaws 4%.\n\n>If we take an average of those percentages, then in Ray Tracing the average uplift of the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti over the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is **11%**. The highest peak was 15%, the lowest valley was 4%.\n\n>We noticed a direct performance-to-power improvement from overclocking, meaning we got about a 9% performance increase from overclocking and about the same power increase. At 9% more performance, the ASUS PRIME GeForce RTX 5070 Ti was more competitive with the uplift over the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER.\n\n>The important part is the MSRP, this is a $749 MSRP video card, and you really want to stay within this range with the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. If this card is available in stock, and at $749, it can provide a decent upgrade from generations of the GeForce RTX 30 series, and down the generations. If you currently have a GeForce RTX 40 series, it would only be an upgrade from a lower tier such as the RTX 4060. If you are in the market for a new GPU at the $749 price point, the [ASUS PRIME GeForce RTX 5070 Ti](https://www.asus.com/us/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rtx5070ti-16g/) is a great option offering that just gives you that right balance of what you need out of a video card at this price range.\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review-asus)\n\n>Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti deserves plenty of accolades. It delivers solid high-end performance, taking over from where the 4070 Ti Super left off. It's not revolutionary, but at least it's (generally) faster and cuts the price by $50. There's still work to be done by Nvidia on the drivers, however, as there's really no good reason why the 4070 Ti Super and even the slower 4070 Ti should, at times, beat the new 5070 Ti.\n\n>While the more expensive RTX 5080 felt disappointing for only offering minor performance improvements over the existing 4080 / 4080 Super, and for sticking with 16GB of VRAM, the 5070 Ti can get away with 16GB by virtue of costing $749. It's only about 10–15 percent faster than its immediate predecessor, but it's also 20–30 percent faster than its direct namesake. And it has some extra stuff that the prior generation lacks.\n\n>Part of the difficulty with Nvidia's latest GPUs is that the names have shifted upward. The xx70-class GPUs at one point cost around $300–$400. Then they became $599 and even $799 parts. Now the 5070 Ti walks that back slightly with a $749 base MSRP. In a sense, it's actually carrying on from the $699 RTX 3080 and the $649 GTX 1080 Ti. Sure, the number has changed, but Nvidia has been trying to stretch the range of GPUs to much higher price segments and has changed the nomenclature as it sees fit.\n\n>The RTX 5070 Ti strikes a good balance between performance, features, and value. It's still an expensive high-end card, but it's certainly a better value than the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080. It's also not faster (most of the time) than the previous generation RTX 4080, at least not unless you want to factor in MFG — and perhaps you should.\n\n>Frame generation tends to be a polarizing topic, with Nvidia acting like it's the same as normally rendered frames. At the other extreme are the \"never framegen\" people who act like it has completely ruined every game that uses the technique. The reality falls somewhere in between.\n\n>MFG is not a bad option to have, is how we view it. On the right games, it can make them look and feel better. Sometimes, it breaks, and you need to tweak some other settings to get the desired result, but again, It's not bad to have options.\n\n>MFG is one more tool in Nvidia's bag of tricks, and it can be helpful in the right situations. It's just not universally better in all situations. It also tends to work and feel better when the baseline performance is sufficiently high. If the final performance is only 100 FPS, meaning a 25 FPS input sampling rate with MFG 4X, that might feel worse than the native 40 FPS to some people.\n\n>So, who is Nvidia targeting with the RTX 5070 Ti? People with an RTX 3070 to 3080 (or lower) GPU who want to upgrade will find plenty to like. It will be about 50% faster in raw performance, and the new features can make it feel like more of a step up than that. At least there are no glaring flaws with the product other than concerns with availability and the possibility of scalpers spoiling the party. But if you already have an RTX 40-series GPU, you should give this generation a pass until something truly compelling comes out.\n\n>We also need to see what actual pricing and availability look like. At $749, the RTX 5070 Ti represents a reasonable high-end graphics card worth purchasing. If the price climbs to $899 or more, however, it becomes far less compelling. We’ve heard there will be more 5070 Ti cards at launch than all the 5090 and 5080 cards that have been sold so far, combined. But there are no concrete numbers, and Nvidia has a tradition of selling out on just about every new GPU generation. The 5070 Ti will likely keep that trend going for at least the first few weeks of its existence.\n\n# [Computerbase - German](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-test.91379/)\n\n# [HardwareLuxx - German](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65525-auf-niveau-der-geforce-rtx-4080-die-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-im-test.html)\n\n# [PCGH - German](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5070-Ti-Grafikkarte-281031/Tests/Release-Preis-Test-Benchmarks-vs-5080-1466041/)\n\n# [Elchapuzasinformatico - Spanish](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2025/02/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x-review/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n# Video Review\n\n# [Der8auer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bKu3O57OJM)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlWmYg7Vr3Q)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2dqGTJ_Hj4)\n\n# [Gamers Nexus Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhtVic3Vm0Y)\n\n# Hardware Canucks\n\n# [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMPK1SeMEZM)\n\n# [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhSA5LYA8XU)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnHaarxf7pg)\n\n# [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf6_Jjvik34)\n\n# [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnhU2ZvHb10)\n\n# OC3D Video\n\n# [Optimum Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVK2FBWcnEo)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v7KboWkdu0)\n\n# [Techtesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GSCc98ZxmA)\n\n# [Tech Yes City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0bdO2SLA6c)",

      "Nice cherry picking only going back 11 years and 5 generations? No, as I stated I am on mobile and you are making me do all of the work to have this conversation. What would be cherry picking is if I pointed out that until the 3000 series aib partners often launched *even cheaper* versions of the card, while modern practice is that it is very rare for aibs to even match msrp. But sure let's keep going back.\n\n\n* 275 was 259 in 2009\n* 470 was 349 in 2010\n* 570 was 349 in 2010\n* 670 was 399 in 2012\n* 770 was 399 in 2013\n\n\nSo actually we have stronger data about how the price is trending up over time, and example data showing Nvidia overvaluing their 70 series on the past and course correcting with the 970 (albeit, with a major lawsuit involved for fake cram). \n\n\nSo adjusted for inflation, and cherry picking in your favor, the 470 would be $510.89 in today's dollars. That's a 7.8% price increase assuming a 5070 MSRP. There's also the increase in taxes that I'll ignore because I'm lazy and it varies anyways.\n\n\nBased on current data for 5000 series we can easily expect a 25 to 35% increase from MSRP, putting the card at about $715, which puts it at 40% over the inflation adjusted 470 msrp, which is exactly what I calculated before on a 970 (albeit without inflation adjustment).\n\n\nI haven't even touched on their scale in gross profitability since 2010. In 2010 they made $1.17 billion, $1.7 billion adjusted for inflation. Now in 2024 they reported $44.3 billion, but I'll be nice and use 2022 instead at at $17.475 billion inflation adjusted to $18.74 billion. \n\n\nSo depending on which side we get to cherry pick from the company has seen an increase of 11-26x gross profitability while raising the price of the 70 series price 8 to 40%. \n\n\nSo take your pick, I guess.",

      "5070TI all day every day, MFG is absolutely insane, im vibing on 4k RT PT 50 FPS baseline turns into 130+FPS and latency penality is not horrible at all",
      "some new games might start to skew the results to the rtx 5070 ti to being faster eventually, techpowerup did a benchmark on the last of us part 2 remastered and somehow it's beaten the 4080 and the 4080 super, it's only one test sample not much to say about it but it could indicate more things in the future.  \nBut really just buy whichever is cheaper they're basically the same card and has warranty for peace of mind.",
      "It's hit and miss, 4x on darktide or hl2 rtx? Preem almost no artifacts and just makes the game run smoother, cp2077? I use 3x because it is smoother than 2x but ex just makes it a blurry mess",
      "So does the 4080S. They are basically the same product.\n\nAccordingly,  OP should buy which ever offers the best package of price, cooler, and warranty.",
      "I know people like to just shit on AI frame gen, but I love 2x. \n\nHowever, 3-4x gets super funky in any games with high motion or first person POV.",
      "If 4080S isn't substantially cheaper - 5070Ti. It is very comparable in performance now, and in future might go futher along with its much better ML performance, hardware Megageometry support, LSS support for RT/PT improvements, SER 2 ect.\n\nIn short - it is very comparable but supports a bunch of things that 4080S either doesn't support or has worse support for, and in due time those differences might become noticeable.",
      "Yeah as someone with a 4080 and getting this exact experience (except my 50 FPS turns to 100, but the latency is the same) I find the latency pretty bad... it really depends on the person",
      "5070Ti without a question! I have that card, and it runs anything on ultra on my 1440 ultrawide OLED screen.",
      "Depends on the level of FG. (These are rough estimates depending on the game) 2x 30-45ms, 3x 50-65, 4x 65+ but with single player games you probably won't tell a difference. Haven't tried on competitive MP games cause I don't play them much. I have a 5070ti for reference",
      "It also depends on whether the OP want's to utilize MFG.",
      "I personally don't see it at all but I guess it's different for anyone. For me personally 4x MFG was worth the purchase.",
      "I just got my 5080 yesterday. Honestly, I can tell it’s on but it’s really good and I think the smoothness helps out. It’s for my wife’s PC anyways and I really doubt she could tell much of a difference and would probably prefer the smoothness. I didn’t think it would be much of an upgrade from a 6900 XT but it definitely was.",
      "The main thing to me is FG is always touted as only being playable lag-wise with a base FPS of 60 FPS. So to take advantage of MFG which is at least 3x, you're really looking at needing a 165-180 Hz monitor to make use of it. My monitors are 144 Hz and my TVs are 120 Hz, so MFG isn't really useful to me without lag, and honestly, with a 5070 Ti, when will I not be able to hit at least 60-70 FPS in a game which would mean I wouldn't need any FG higher than x2?",
      "I would suggest to look out for 5070 TI MSRP if they’re around the same price. I was able to get one from Newegg 2 days back. But, if you get 4080 super for a good discount right now, you can get that.",
      "Here are my results on these. 4080 Super OC +185 +1000 110% Power Limit - 69.50 on Steel Nomad and the 5070 Ti +350 +1750 116% Power Limit - 69.84 on Steel Nomad. \n\nSame but different!",
      "I have both. And I'm digging the 5070ti. It does look better in 4k at the same settings. Js IMHO.."

      "Yeah so the 5070ti is functionally identical to the 7900xtx in raster. Lots of people were saying the 7900xtx was much faster, but 3% is margin of error that can swing either direction depending on game selection.",
      "Yo, this took a lot of time to compile. Appreciate it man. \n\nIt's the least worst of all the cards released so far. It's 11-14% faster than a 4070TiS depending on the res. It's also 6% cheaper than the 4070TiS. Put the two together, and it's about 20% better for the same price. Which is the bare minimum for gen-on-gen in my completely arbitrary opinion.\n\nEdit: this is presuming you somehow nabbed a MSRP card. The real price seems to be $900.",

      "Can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard “the XTX is way faster than the 4080 Super in raster”. These people don’t live in reality.",
      "I've had one yesterday tell me that 7900XTX is plain 20% faster because in one (out of whole 5) games tested by GN at 1440p XTX was like 17% faster. Disregarding than in the rest of those it was at best 10% faster and in any wider benchmark it never broke even 10% properly.",

      "And the moment you turn on DLSS/RT then that margin gets trampled.\n\nOnly thing holding back the 5070ti now is the low stock price",
      "Man, I thought the 4070 struggling to consistently match the 3080 was sad, but now the freaking *70 Ti* card flat out loses to the previous gen 80 card? Can't even punch *half a tier* up?\n\nI guess once (if?) they come back down to MSRP that will make them good enough value... but you can also look at it as: 5 years after the 3080, you get slightly less than 4080 performance for slightly more than 3080 MSRP. If 40 series killed performance per dollar advancement then 50 series is dancing on its grave",
      "Very comprehensive comparison",
      "To be fair, even used 4070 ti super cards are going for much higher than its msrp on places like ebay.",
      "Some people live to cherry pick data because that confirms their beliefs. Maybe they are destined to be cherry farmers! \n\nThat's why i always appreciate what this OP is doing on his website because these sort of aggregation of many reviews is the only way we can get the big picture.",
      "Yeah, definitely not a 1:1 comparison when the 50 series doesn't really sell at MSRP with most vendors. Still an interesting comparison though nonetheless.",
      "Have any reviewers found that their cards have the ROP issue?",
      "I nabbed one at MSRP (PNY) to replace my 7900xt. Raster increase is meh but buying for the DLSS4 over FSR and RT upgrades.",
      "I think someone should do a gen-to-gen performance comparison between Nvidia's various generations, on a per tier, apple-to-apples basis. Because I think an 11-14% uplift from a whole 2 year generational gap is probably not that great. Yeah it's technically a better deal than the previous gen, but not really.",
      "And it *should* hit MSRP eventually. Even the 3070 and 4070 did after a while.\n\n(And, of course, pretty much every gen before that, MSRP was just a higher price to make the always-lower street price seem like a better deal, like it is for every other kind of product. That was normal, and should be again, if competition ever starts being a thing again in the GPU space. All eyes on you intel).",
      "Not really, when it's not cheaper than the 4070ti super, but ok, maybe some models are in the US.\nEssentially it's a relaunch of the 4080/4080 super. Same price, same performance.",

      "Barely 15% faster than a 4060Ti isn't \"decent\", it's simply substandard.\n\nDepending on who you ask 20% would be decent and 25% good especially when you consider that its MSRP (at least on paper) is $70 lower than the previous gen.",
      "if it was 100 less it'd be a good card lol",
      "It's all about price, it seems like an average card but the 8gb one is ridiculous at the price point, just needs to be removed from the stack at this point and offer 12gb + across the board (more ideally 16gb) for this price region.\n\n\nMSRP is worthless these days as well sadly so reviewing is difficult as the context is changing, saying a card is good or bad typically hinges on where it is priced against the competition.",
      "Reddit told me it's the worst card of all time",
      "About a year ago people were telling us we were wrong about 8GB being too little VRAM. So now reviewers finally agree that 8GB is too low and they suggest a 12GB card. How long will that last?",
      "2060 Super was between 1070Ti and 1080.  \n3060Ti was roughly equivalent to 2080 or 2080 Super.  \n5060Ti is very far from 4080 or even 4070Ti. It's worse than a 4070.",
      "> and they suggest a 12GB card\n\nThe very same card which nVidia crippled on purpose, because they knew it offered the best price/perf ratio 😒",
      "I think reviewers gotta realize that not everyone wants to or has the money to spend up. So instead they spend down and accept their fate.",
      "Not the worst, but it’s still pretty underwhelming. They say it’s a decent uplift of about 15-20% from the previous gen, but you’re comparing it to the wet noodle that was the 4060ti, which couldn’t decide if it was a 10% uplift over the 3060ti or slightly behind it when it’s crippled bandwidth started making an impact on performance. It’s even more amusing realizing the 3080, a 4 year old card mind you, is still beating the 5060ti in rasterized performance. \n\nPoint is, people are a bit excited at the fact it has 16gb of vram and isn’t gonna cost another $100 more than the 8gb model, but that’s still a big *if*, considering there is no FE model for AIBs to base the price around.",
      "What was the historical uplift? Say 1060 to 2060 to 3060?",
      "Everything about this lineup is geared toward upselling you.\n\n* 5060 8GB: Unimpressive entry level card, just exists to grab low info buyers\n* 5060 Ti 8GB: Complete non-starter, shouldn’t exist.\n* 5060 Ti 16GB: Fine, poor value compared to the marginally more expensive 5070.\n* 5070: Decent performance for price but VRAM limited, will be obsolete soon.\n* 5070 Ti: The first actual desirable option\n* 5080: The “upgrade” pick\n\nBasically you’re making major, arguably unacceptable, compromises all the way up until $750. It’s the most blatant example I’ve seen of stair-stepping consumers into spending more money.",
      "Literally just reviewing the card. You can make up your own mind, right?\n\nOr do the reviewers really have to act like outrage merchants for you to not be upset with their content?",
      "Hopefully by this point next year more people will realize that 12GB for any card above $500 is also a scam.",
      "Man, the 3060ti was crazy good value if not for the ridiculous 8GB of vram.\n\n\nI would not have upgraded to a 5070 if it was not the case.",
      "For Reddit any NVIDIA card is the worst of all time.",
      "Depends what time period you include historically.  20 years ago, generation to generation jumps were much bigger.  Partly because they were starting out with much more constrained designs that were easier to improve on, and partly because the fabrication was doing better with scaling from generation to generation.  But no matter how you approach the data, this is a small jump.  Historically, it probably would have been called a small die shrink and this would have been the \"X50\" -> \"X50, Upgraded Edition\" rather than the \"Y50.\"  It's really only being marketing as a whole new generation of the product line because the marketing department figures we are due for a new generation.\n\nThe 1600 series and RTX2000 launched on 12nm (at TSMC).\n\nRTX 3000 was 8nm (but manufactured at Samsung, so not directly comparable)\n\nRTX 4000 was 4nm (Back to TSMC)\n\nRTX 5000 is on a slightly different/newer process node at TSMC but still advertised at \"4nm.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nvidia_graphics_processing_units#RTX_50_series\n\nSo they underlying manufacturing technology hasn't had a generational jump this time.  That limits how much new stuff NV can pack into the design.  They get a few percent from improved design, and a few percent from refinements in the manufacturing process.  But in ye Oelden days of advanced CPU/GPU product lines, something advertised as a whole new generation of the product line would typically happen when manufacturing tech could cram about 2x as many parts onto a chip, so you would expect to get >2x the performance generation to generation rather than like 20%.  Since modern manufacturing is already counting individual atoms in numbers you could keep track of on your fingers when laying down layers of material, there's a lot less \"low hanging fruit\" to improve on these days.  Whatever they release as the \"RTX 6000 series\" will probably be the sort of improvement over the 4000 series that folks were hoping for, with all the manufacturing process improvements that weren't ready for this product cycle.",
      "Honest question, do people still expect like 30-40% uplift every generation? The chip hasn't changed much at all from 40 to 50 series. Besides, most people don't upgrade gen to gen, so even the it's 15-20% better doesn't matter because people are comparing from multiple gens back sometimes.",
      "I believe the 8gb versions (they’re releasing a NON-ti 5060 eventually? what is this, a graphics card for ants?) exist for 3 reasons:\n\n1. Price anchoring for the 16gb version. Although it’s only an additional +13% in price, so that’s pretty questionable.   \n\n2. Provide an entry level, 16gb card, that people can afford, in lieu of scalped **70+ SKU models.   \n\n3. Compete with Intel / AMD entries, simply to recapture market share. People climb the ladder over time, so 5060 buyers are (a) not buying competitor products and (b) going to spend more future money with Nvidia.\n\nAs a 3060 12gb owner I’ve felt lucky for years given the 12gb and performance. I thought the 5060ti 16gb would be a significant upgrade, but they’re saying it’s only 15% on average, 30% in **some** games. Ugh.",
      "It feels like pricing and naming/positioning, is what many criticism boils down in reality. Not just for this card but some others. If some of these cards didn't have its name/position and the price to match that name/position, they might be much better regarded.",
      "Gen to gen it is. Price to perfrmance it is ok"

The 5090 offers a decent uplift over the 4090 if you ignore the insane, needless melting hazard, but the rest of the 50 series is offering less of a gain than some mid-generation upgrades for the Super or Ti models. It's legitimately embarrassing to see the 5070 Ti still getting outdone by the 4080, or even 4070 Ti Super in some cases, especially given the price increase.\n\nI'm fine with big prices if it means big performance, but the 50 series represents nothing of the sort unless you're exclusively powering AI. DLSS and Frame Gen are amazing technologies that can be used in lieu of significant hardware improvements, but fundamentally they are band-aids, not long-term solutions, and people shouldn't be expected to pay that much for what amounts to a temporary shortcut.",

      "I went from a Gigabyte gaming oc 3080 10GB to a Gigabyte aorus master 5070TI and it was well worth for me... to be fair, I built a new pc for it but then again, the cpu in my old machine was holding the 5070ti back",
      "I made this upgrade a few weeks back for the same reason. I’ve been happy with the results I’ve gotten so far. If you can find a 5070ti at/near MSRP, pull the trigger",
      "Yea but the whole \"leaps and bounds\" thing is almost certainly because of the rest of your PC. \n\nGTA is very light on the GPU, raytracing obviously makes it harder to run, but again my 3080 can do 60fps in 4k with raytracing on, it never drops below 120fps with raytracing off (4k ultra). \n\nWouldn't be surprised if a 5070ti can do 120fps or close to it with raytracing on if the rest of the pc is good.\n\nEDIT: [100+ fps in the city at 4k with everything maxed out including RT.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gWczfTXuw) That is with DLSS Quality which imo is foolish not to use. If you play at 1440p or can settle for DLSS balanced at 4k then the 5070ti can easily do 120fps.",
      "That's fair, sadly they are kinda disappointing if you have a 4090. Overclocked 5080 is almost a 4090 but still.",
      "Depends what games you play imo. I’d probably wait though",
      "Up to you bud.  Personally I went from a 3080 ti- 5080 which is a similar jump to what you’re talking about.  I couldn’t be happier. My last card could do 4k60 all day but now I can crank out 4k 144 and it looks just insane",
      "Upgrading from a 3080 10GB to a 5070 Ti. Got the 5070Ti for $830. I can sell my 3080 for quite a bit, so the cost to upgrade is not so bad. My 3080 is still really good, but it’s not cutting it in some titles then I would need to lower graphics settings or use DLSS performance. My main reason is the VRAM because at 1440p I have always had to set the texture setting down 1-2 settings",
      "Personally I have a 3080Ti and will be skipping this generation. The performance increase I would get is simply not worth the money, if staying in the same price class as what I paid for my current card",
      "Honest review of 5070 ti upgraded from 4070 original. The upgrade is and feels nice. It’s not as major as I thought it would be (nvidia drivers underperforming, bugs etc). I play in 3440x1440 and now I can push way more than my 4070. PT and DLSS quality on cyberpunk and wukong do feel way nicer. I can push some more 2k/4k texture mods on cyberpunk and keep 70 fps (with frame gen x2 - I know it’s not ideal because my actual frames is 35-40 but I’m having fun and it feels responsive enough for me). \nHaving said the above DONT buy it for the x3 x4 FG. It’s completely unusable as it stand now at least to my testing. Too many artifacts and glitches. I believe that they will improve it on the future as they did with DLSS during the 40 series but now, 2 weeks with my 5070 ti it is on instant disable. Diablo 4 feels better than my 4070 but even there the x3 x4 MFG is unusable. \n\nTLDR: the upgrade from 4070 to 5070 ti feels nice but don’t buy it for the multi frame generation - not worth it as is currently. Buy a 50 series for the DLSS upgrade and 2x frame generation update from 30 series if you believe you need it.",
      "I would wait for 6000 series\n\nI mean which game RTX 3080 can't handle at 1440p ??? Even the most demanding games, you can still use \"optimized setting\" to improve fps and DLSS quality mode\n\n5070 Ti is big upgrade but 3080 can still run modern games  with no issue.",
      "If you want framegen on your 3080, you can try out DLSS to FSR Framegen mod available at Nexus mods. Basically, enables the DLSS4 Framegen checkbox in games for your 3080. Pair it with DLSS4 swapper so you will benefit from the less blur of DLSS4 as well.\n\nGPU price are atrocious at the moment and I would not support that kind of price imo"

My gain over my 4070 Ti Super is not as impressive as the FPS gain I had in gains so honestly Im only looking @ real world and remember recently the nvidia drivers that gave everyone big 3dmark gains with no real world fps...

Couldn't get any older generation cards with similar performance for any cheaper at the time so it made sense to me. I'm sure it doesn't beat the 4080 in everything because computer hardware is weird that way. It also beats the 4080S in some benchmarks🤷. I just don't think all the flack is warranted I think some rare outliers are contributing to confirming bias and making people think all 50 series cards suck.

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI'm about to purchase a new PC and the last component I need is the GPU. I've been debating between the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 because I'm no longer a poor student - I finally have a job and can afford the high-end PC I've always dreamed of.\n\nHowever, I've run into concerns about the RTX 5090's melting connector issue due to poor design, and I can't bring myself to click the order button. The 5080 costs a lot, and the 5090 is twice that amount! I don't want to worry about the connector suddenly melting. I've read extensively about ways to minimize risk: using quality cables, ensuring proper connection, and limiting power consumption.\n\nBut it feels REALLY wrong to pay premium money for something with a faulty design that requires power limiting just to prevent failure. This was already happening with the 4090, and NVIDIA hasn't done enough to address it.\n\nNow I'm truly at a loss. I've heard the 5080 is less prone to this issue, but there are still reported cases on Reddit, and who knows how many go undocumented online.\n\nI understand the 5070 Ti is safe, and the 9070 XT is even safer since it doesn't use this connector at all - but these aren't top-tier specs anymore.\n\nI'll primarily game at 1440p, and from watching performance benchmarks in games like Path of Exile 2 on ultra settings, it seems only the RTX 5080 maintains stable 60+ FPS at 1440p, while the RTX 5070 Ti and 9070 XT drop below 40 FPS on busy maps.\n\nHas anyone else faced this dilemma? I really don't know what to do.",

Those with issues are the loudest voices and those that don't are drowned out.\n\n4090 FE (launch day) + Corsair HX1000 + Corsair 12VHPWR (hx1000 doesn't  come with one)- no issues\n\n5090 FE (launch day) + Seasonic TX1600 + included ATX3.0 (12VHPWR cable) - no issues\n\nAlways UV+OC for maximum performance (.95v target for 4090, .9v target for 5090)\n\nIf you simply can't handle the worry, try to get a card from a AIB that has a warranty centre in your country. Or downgrade to a 5080.",

The 5070 Ti offers very good performance, the 5080 offers some extra on top, getting dangerously close to a 4090 but with MFG on top, if you don't feel like spending a ton, and the 5090 offers performance with no parallel, if money is no object. There's no wrong choice.",
      "5080 and a new qd oled 1440p monitor would be nice",

      "5080 should be totally fine as long as you are not trying to force a shoddy connection setup.",
      "There isn't a single 5000 series GPU with load balancing capabilities.\n\nYou are probably thinking of the Astral's ability to monitor but it can't actually balance.  Not sure I'd trust ASUS support either.  There are plenty of people still complaining that ASUS refused warranty due CID, which is nonsense.",

      "I can't imagine myself going online to cry about melted cable in a Reddit post if that happen to me. I'd say these posts on Reddit are just 1% of the people that were touched by this issue, maybe even less.",
      "5090 if you can afford it",
      "Indeed this is how I upgraded 👍",
      "Is there somewhere that advertises this? From what I'm aware the Astra just has pin monitoring but I have not seen anything about them making a PSU that can load balance on it\n\nI see a voltage sense for their thor 3 but it doesn't say anything about per pin balancing. It just seems to be a voltage drop feature which would not really help since overall voltage on the 12v cables stays ok",
      "Best cooling system? Uhh no.",
      "Have yet to see a 5080 melt where user error was not the issue.",
      "Tbh I'd say get the 5080 overclock it and enjoy it. It gets a pretty nice bump from OC. I run my 90 at 85% with an OC as it barely sacrifices anything and lots of games run well below that. But I got an Fe I could not bring myself to pay aib prices they are pretty crazy.",
      "Congrats on getting a good paying job! If you have a job where you can afford the 5090 comfortably, then I presume you’d be able to deal with any mishaps on the financial side. I also think overkill can teach you if you want overkill or not. \n\nSome people truly don’t understand the frames they will get with a 90 series card until they have it. Many will realize that they actually don’t need a 90 card if all they are doing is gaming (I always say a 90 card should be used for 4K gaming or productivity builds and a bit of gaming). I’d say go with the 5090 and then make a separate post here and in other PC subreddits asking about what you need to do to ensure your cables don’t melt and also search PC subreddits in general for the same question as well as searching online and watching videos to be as researched as possible.\n\nWhen you upgrade again in however many years, you might realize that you won’t need the top of the line and that the 70Ti or the 80 will be enough so you can also save money. However, if you are part of the 1% who just has unlimited money to throw at these things, then just always go for the 90 card.\n\nOne last bit of helpful advice, the 5090 Astral Asus card has an indicator screen that shows you power distribution, so you can see if the power is being distributed evenly or if it’s not. This means that you have a grasp on if your cables might begin to melt and seeing that indicator can allow you to stop it before that happens. Now, fixing that issue is annoying as you have to unplug the card from the motherboard and doing that, for some, causes a higher risk of the card to melt cables. Nvidia really dropped the ball with the 12vhpwr cable. The Astral is crazy expensive and is hardly ever in stock unless you are lucky and live near a micro center that has it in stock. You’ll likely have to wait or pay nearly $5000 for as that is the scalper price currently.\n\nGood luck and I hope this helps!",
      "there are honestly not enough connectors melting to make this an issue on deciding, just go with what you actually want",
      "If you are really worried buy a cheap dc clampmeter. After you installed your gpu, use furmark to let it run at 100% and check each of the 12 cables of the 12v6x2 with the clampmeter. If every cable is below 9 amps, the overall cable and connection is fine.",
      "get 80 or 90 but also get a wireview pro from thermal grizzly website. it comes with temp probes and will give you real time info on temp and currents on wire. \n\ni maybe very wrong on this and not sure, but i saw video where it was even doing slight load balancing even. \n\nwith this i will also suggest get a new atx 3.1 certified psu. i can suggest MSI MPG series and MEG series. they come with newer standard H++ cables. \n\nfrom what i have seen, the older corsair hx or ax series psu cables were getting most affected. recently an msi one also burnt but that was atx 3.0 cable so cant really say if that was the issue.\n\nbut then, the fact is newer cards pull a lot of power, and recently while seeing a review of a zotac solid 5090, the video host said and showed as how the cables were getting absolute hot and warm air from the gpu cooler and then also being hot on its own. i guess reached 78C or something. per wire amp was decent.",
      "Get the 5090. I couldn't decide when the 5080 / 5090 came out, which one to get. Well after some time, I just went all in for a 5090 and got the Astral OC. Expensive, but it's worth it.\n\nI have undervolted to 0.935 volts and it runs like butter while under running Steel Nomad test and Speedway and got max of 501w used. At full power normally it maxed out at 560w in stress testing. Now with gaming the card undervolted I don't go over 400w in gaming and a GPU temp of max 58 celsius."

      "What did you do to keep the LM from leaking?  What seal did you do? Please share for science.",
      "No idea why someone would apply conductive liquid to an electronic device. I’ve seen enough fried gpu due to LM on YouTube to know it’s a bad idea.",
      "Yeah, it's overclocked to 3200mhz on the core, +3000mhz on the VRAM, and also undervolted to 990mv. Not sure about the fan RPM, I left that alone. I have the power limit set to 120%. I can go up to 133% with the 400w BIOS I flashed but I don't want to push that much power through my card.",
      "Well, TBH I was hoping for a bigger temperature drop.\n\nI just like pushing my hardware to its limits. I'm a bit OCD about it.",
      "I left the gel alone. My experience with PTM 7950 is that it is not as good as liquid metal.",
      "I cleaned the thermal paste off the GPU core with alcohol and Q tips. I left the rest of the thermal goo as it was. There was quite a bit of it and it was pretty messy.",
      "You need to use clear nail polish to coat anything conductive near the core of the GPU (or CPU if you're doing this to a CPU). Some people build a little \"dam\" of sorts around the perimeter, but I have never bothered with this. The trick is to use a tiny amount of liquid metal. It should in theory get sandwiched in there and never go anywhere. I have done this on 7 systems now and I have had no issues, including on laptops that get moved around a lot. Actually laptops are where liquid metal is the most useful. I typically notice 25C temperature drops on them, and they run way quieter as a result."

You’re only at 1080p 165hz, spending 1000 on a 750 dollar GPU that you don’t need seems unreasonable to me.",

You'll still see improvements overall since the performance is close to/neck and neck with the 4080.\n\n Improvements in streaming? Yes definitely the encoder on the new cards have been improved, they usually improve over time so whether you're using NVENC or the new AV1, 50-series has the latest. Though the biggest jump in my opinion was from 20-series to 30-series when NVENC was still in its infancy though its been improved a lot.\n\nWhen you're playing are you using DLSS? That helps a lot in performance. Even with my system I'm unable to maximize MHWilds and get super high fps, thats just the game, its poorly optimized.

      "Yes I have this card pretty great performance, on load its reached 80°-85° not more than that. And my room's ambient temp is 30° So this card in MSRP is a good value. I also undervolt the card. It consumes almost half of the electricity!  150-180W, TDP was 300W.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fahxtgcwglse1.jpeg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dda5ec671a5ecc548b4ef9943f4c8aee4a3dbac3",
      "> solid oc\n\nSame. My main complaint about the card is that the minimum fan speed (30%) is a whopping 1200 RPM, so it's annoyingly loud at low loads. Which is ridiculous for a cooler that massive.\n\nFans rarely ramp up higher than the minimum even in heavy games, so the 1200 RPM minimum is massively overkill. As of now the fans are basically ON or OFF, nothing in between. I had to run some FurMark and push it to 300W for the fans to ramp up more.\n\nEither they cheaped out on fans that can't run below 1200 RPM (very unlikely) or chosen fans that spin waaay to fast at the minimum required 30% PWM (more likely). The card could easily do up to like 75% TDP with fans at 800 RPM or something like that.\n\nI've actually sent Zotac a message asking of there's possibly a planned VBIOS update to adress this issue, but IIRC Nvidia enforces this 30% lower limit so the chances of this ever getting fixed are probably very slim. I guess adding a resistor or using an adapter to connect the fans to a fan hub or motherboard for control is a possibility, but disassembling a card this new (and expensive) isn't for me at least.\n\nI'd suspect the Core has the same issue.",
      "how do you undervolt?",

      "It does, so idle is fine. The issue is the 1200 RPM minimum when the fans do turn on, which is way too high for such a massive heatsink.",
      "I guess hard to say?\n\nMSI has made very nice GeForce cards in the past, I would argue they're still on top of their game just like Asus. Personally I'm very happy with Gigabyte. Most reddit users have a preference for a brand for a reason.\n\nSmaller or larger fan fins are something that can be a giveaway for an acoustic signature of a fan, but they're not a definite tell.\n\nAlso, everyone has their own preferences. Figuring out what sound profile works for you will sadly be quite the research.\n\nAt last, coil whine is sadly a prevalent issue in many graphics cards. The only thing you can do is to try and undervolt the graphics card and see if that solves the issue. Perhaps it has a correlation with the amount of effort/cost is put into the board lay-out of the graphics card.\n\nThe issue the poster above you is describing is the amount of noise the fans make at 30% fan speed.

It ran below 1100 RPM under full load in TechPowerUp's review, so with an undervolt curve in Afterburner and well ventilated case I'm hoping it'll be possible to keep around 1000 RPM max. Should be really quiet compared to the Zotac's 1200 minimum in any case.",
      "I have a solid oc but not core. It's pretty good. Idk how good temps can get cus I'm new to this but I underclocked to get 60 ish for most games.",

      "I have this now, it's kinda mid. While gaming at 4k with 300w, temps were 70ish and the fan kept going up\n\nmax was 1900rpm i think. but it's a torture test, i don't think everyone does this kinda test. it consumes way less in other games, or lower resolutions. game was 40k space marines II btw\n\ni did an undervolt after that,  it is much more tolerable now. it has no cw whatsoever, so i can deal with some fan noise and i can always do more aggressive uv and have a very quite card.",

No space anyways due to the NH12A being such a unit.\n\nAt first I confirmed that it has full 96 ROPs. \nNext I ran Nomad 3Dmark. Gets up to 66C at 270 Watt and is subjectively not  loud. It turns off the fans in idle which I like. So in idle only my two front Chromax 140 are running at 900 RPM. \n\n\nI need to check fan RPM, measure db with my phone and test some Furmark later. It has relatively low coil whine compared to my 4090 which is great.\n\nWill undervolt since it is the only way you can extract more performance since the PT seems to be locked at 100% in Afterburner. People seem to be having great success doing that. \n\nThe cooler looks to be easily deshrouded without losing warranty so that is definetly an option for the low noise faction. I‘m also considering it but on the other hand what is the point if it works anyways.\n\nAll in all I‘m quite pleased with the card for it having such a light cooler.

I would like to keep it until 7000 series unless the future 6080 gets +50% performance.\n\nAlso, if the 5070 ti is not capable, and the 5080 is but only for the short term, sould I go 5070 ti + 1440p?\n\nMonitor budget is not a problem as I see it as a long term purchase.",

It took one measly generation to get us to forget the performance comparison of a 70 ti card compared to an 80 series and we'll be paying for it until we wisen up as consumers",

It's turned me off.\n\nI think, like you, I might give the 9070XT a gander, too. If they can price it reasonably enough, I'll take it.\n\nIf not, then I'll my textures to medium and let my 3070 carry me to 2026/2027 until the next generation.\n\nI'm not going to bother with a mid-gen refresh of what is basically already a mid-gen refresh. Hopefully this is a short-lived generation like the 700 series, and we get a new gen by the end of 2026.",
      "It really is awful. This $900 pricing for a XX70 ti seems nuts. Next generation needs a price cut. If prices keep going up like this, then I'm not sure if mainstream buyers will bother with, say, a $500 XX60 GPU when they can buy a whole freaking console for the same price.",

You can still play those games just fine without PhysX, all AMD cards can play those games just fine and so can RTX 50.\n\nFor the PhysX afficionados - if you really want PhysX in those select few games then install any dirt cheap used Nvidia graphics card as a secondary GPU in your system and select it as PhysX accelerator in Control Panel.\n\nIt is a tiny fraction of the cost of an RTX 5070 Ti to get a dedicated PhysX accelerator going, let alone the cost of a 5080 or 5090.",

The game runs just fine without it.\n\nAnd if you really need it, again: get a dedicated accelerator for PhysX, the cost is negligible for most people who would care about getting it as they probably already have the motherboard that can handle it just fine, and used very old Nvidia cards go for pennies.",

I know you all like to hate the card cause it’s not a big up lift from the 40 series, but coming from the 20s or 30s it’s a big uplift. \n\nNow if you can save up for a 9070xt or a 5070ti that’d be optimal, but if you are still budget restricted the 5070 is good.",
      "5070 for sure. I mean, if you can find a 9070xt at msrp, go for that, but the 5070 is pretty easy to get for $550, whereas the 9070xt seems to have settled at around 700-800. The 9070xt is ~20% better at most things, while being ~30-40% more expensive.",
      "I guess that depends on location then. In western Europe the 9070XT is at least 100 euros over MSRP. While the 5060Ti, 5070 and 5070Ti can all be purchased for MSRP. So to me it feels like AMD just set a fake MSRP for marketing purposes.",
      "Tbh ur set up is already good as is but if u have a budget of 600 try getting an rx 9070xt ( idk how much they go for in ur country but they shouldn’t be expensive by a lot so try to save a bit more ) and then sell ur old rtx 2080 ti and get a new cpu, i have the r5 5600 too and i can tell u it will bottleneck with a 5070 or 9070xt, get the r7 5800x3d or r5 5600x3d ( they go for diff prices so try to get one thats am4 for ur mb and also one thats in the budget after selling ur old gpu ) with such component i’d recommend a good psu too so check if yours is enough",

      "That's the thing. You can't find them for msrp. People don't hate cards, or brands. They hate the price to performance. \n\nPeople are saying you can find them close to msrp on these specific models but then have never tried to get one at that price. You can't. They sell out by bots in seconds. Add $200-500 to every single graphics card and that's the new msrp atm.",
      "And it out performs the 2080ti by a mile, it beats the 3080ti too so what’s your point? Generationally from the 40 series it doesn’t make sense to upgrade from to the 50 series. You all fail to understand that real world data shows time and again that the 5070 is a good card and it’s better than you want to give it any sort of credit for. Stop giving bad advice and saying that you need to buy only the 9070 or 9070xt, especially when you can’t get either of those for under $700.\n\nFor the it’s better because 4gb more vram, the 9070 beats the 5070 in some games with raw performance. Once you turn on fsr and dlss, the 5070 wins in almost all instances and is more widely supported. The two cards are equal in performance especially for the price difference.",
      "Its good for 1080p and even some 2k. 4060 is roughly a 2080 non TI but with better RT. 2080TI is better with more Vram.",
      "It is, if you look at the fine details. 64 CU generally coming within a few percent or beating the previous 96 CU flagship is a feat within itself. IF you could find it at msrp it’s an insane value. I couldn’t even find one in stock let alone msrp so I grabbed a 5070ti for a small amount over msrp. The 5070 isn’t a bad card at msrp, but I was at microcenter the other day and saw an OPEN BOX for 610$ like wtf lol.",
      "12gb isn’t enough in 2 games at 4k with path tracing and max settings, cool. It’s a midrange card that isn’t made to play in 4k with max settings. 16gb cards struggle with that too, so is 16gb not enough?",
      "You might as well just not. Not really a big improvement for the cost. Save up a bit more, get a 9070 XT",
      "9070XT",
      "The problem is only partly the generational uplift. Mainly the vram. \nThe 2080ti has 11GB with 13TFlops@FP32. The 5070 has 12GB with 30TFlops@FP32 that is possibly the worst balance between vram and performance I have ever seen. And that 2080Ti is 7!!! years old. With the developers optimizing games poorly nowadays, I would not recommend the 5070 at all. Especially when you want to own it for more than 2 years. \nIn real gaming performance the 5070 is about 60% faster.\n\nI would go for the 9070 non XT. It's objectively the better card with better performance, equal efficiency but 4GB more vram and better OC potential. I just don't know the pricing situation where you guys life.\n\nIf you care for noise, check out the reviews on the 9070 Hellhound or TUF OC. 650rpm and under 60° core at full load is mind blowing. Greetings.",
      "The 9070XT is a great card. Imo from 5070 and up there aren't necessarily bad cards it all depends on price. If you would be able to get a 9070XT for MSRP it's obviously the best value card right now. To bad AMD set a fake MSRP and, atleast in my region, the 9070XT barely differences in price from the 5070Ti.\n\nWich at those prices the 5070Ti is just the better deal.",
      "Will now it outperforms it, but there are already situations and games where the 12GB isn't enough. And that will be worse in a couple of yours. That's my point."

      "If you don't mind spending a bit more or waiting and hoping prices drop, the zotac one is really good. I got the solid oc (not the solid core) for £850 on launch and am really happy with it. Performs well and has a super beefy cooler. Power limit is 345w which is up there with all the high end cards.\n\nAlthough I do think they increased the price of it now as it's so good. \n\nNot too sure how the solid core compares, but I know it uses a slightly smaller cooler (2.5 slot instead of 3.5)."

By default, without changing any settings, under full load my GPU hit 78–80°C with the fans at 55%. If you raise them to 75%, it sounds like a jet engine.

In elden ring, max everything but no raytracing, it was sat around 41C! \nOverclocks well to, with the little I've played around with it. Cooler seems more than adequate for a 5070ti, maybe go for the solid if your considering a 5080.

Card is an absolute beast, I paid $820 no tax (effectively $750 w/ tax). Runs 4k gaming insanely well. Cyberpunk max 4k path-tracing + dlss quality + MFG 4x gets around 100 fps and looks amazing on my 4k240 oled. Most other AAA titles can get to \\~60-70 fps completely maxed and if no frame gen supported, most support driver level Smooth Motion which looks great and bumps it into 100+ range.\n\nI undervolted mine, partially due to fear of instability with my underpowered PSU, got a bit more performance out of it for free. \n\nDriver-wise no major complaints from me. April drivers (the one everyone complained about) lowered my FPS a bit on Cyberpunk, potentially due to conflicting with my undervolt. I rolled back to March and it works great. I don't plan to update my driver unless patch notes have something interesting.\n\nIt's a beast of a card. \\~10-15% slower than 5080, same VRAM, way cheaper, undervolts to about 5080 level performance.

I didn’t really notice anything strange when opening the package, box was in good condition, and the GPU was properly sealed I think. \n\nI could return it but they won’t replace it since it’s not in stock anymore, so I can only get a refund. Unfortunately I can’t test it right now as I’m waiting to receive my motherboard.\n\nWhat do you think about this damage ?

    "comments": [
      "99% sure it’ll work fine and won’t get worse if it just spends years sitting in a case. The GPU is held in place by the screws on the back panel, not by the pcie connector.\n\nAnd if it doesn’t work, you can always get that refund, right?",
      "It's fine, just a minor product defect.",

      "it is gonna work fine but i would be worried that any future RMA attempt will be denied due to \"physical damage to the card\", even if the manufacturer knows this has nothing to do with the RMA reason, they will still use it as an excuse. I mean Gamers nexus once tried to RMA a non-functioning joystick on a handheld console, and warranty got denied because there was a microscopic scratch on the plastic on the back of the console. After that any kind of damage can be used as an excuse to deny RMA. Also resaling the gpu in the future will be a problem, you will have to convince the buyer that it is jus cosmetic.\n\nI would do it like, find out if the gpu is a good overclocker and if you can run 3200+ mhz on core and +3000 on memory. If yes, you got an above average piece and it is worth it to keep it. If it is an average or even horrible overclocker just return it. You could also try to mount it vertically to see if it has leaking get issue. If you get the core and vram sufficienty hot (80°C) it should take no more than couple days to see first signs of leakage. If you dont want to deal with all this leaking gel on gigabyte gpus fiasco, refund and get another brand, preferably asus prime. It would be quite unfortunate though, because it is possible to flash bios from the GB Aorus gpu that has 400W TDP onto your eagle, which would help the core boost up to 100mhz higher and you would never ever be power limited again. If your gpu is a great overclocker AND you flash the aorus bios on it, you will have one of the fastest 5070Tis on the planet, capable of breaking 3dmark records despite being just a 2-slot msrp model.",
      "Return it now.  If you keep it with that damage and need to RMA later, they will use that damage as the reason to deny your RMA.\n\nDO NOT ACCEPT DAMAGED GOODS!",
      "Wow, a Gigabyte 5070Ti post that isn't about the thermal gel??? It's not a massive issue, but RMA it now that you just received it don't even bother testing it out. If it doesn't bother you, test it out, I'm sure it still will work just fine.",
      "If all the pins are clean itll be fine, still test it anyways, no point in returning a card you got below msrp if its totally fine",
      "Alright thanks guess I’ll add some support under the card as well. Yeah sure I can get the refund, I have 14 days to return it, but I’d rather just keep it if it works lol I won’t find another one at this price.. can’t wait to test it",
      "Sorry for leading your reply off rom the original post but why exactly do you recommend asus prime 5070 ti? I am stuck between choosing which one to buy",
      "This logic makes sense.\n\nOr at least document it by sending them an e-mail with the picture or something. So you can reference it later.",
      "if you can get asus prime oc  for msrp price, i think it is the best 5070ti gpu currently. the cooler is slightly better, 1°C and 0.8dba quieter based on one direct korean yt video comparison with windforce, mainly because it uses PTM7950 phase change material on core that doesnt suffer from drying up, so the temperatures should stay this good forever basically. It offers 116% power limit straight out of the box, usually you need to pay a fat premium to get higher power limit than 100%. it also has 3x pcie 8-pin -> 12WHPWR adapter in the box instead of 2x pcie -> 12WHPWR so it ensures more stable power delivery. you can also apparently flash bios from asus strix on it that allows to reach higher boost clocks.\n\ncouple people have written me that the newer batches of windforce 5070ti no longer work with bioses from higher end gpus, so they cannot increase power limit by simply flashing a higher power limit bios anymore, plus all gigabyte gpus have leaking thermal gel issues mainly vertically mounted (my horizontally mounted windforce is fine, i keep checking it thoroughly and no gel has moved but maybe other batches have issues with it.\n\nmsi ventus/shadow models have louder fans that spin faster than on other msrp models, inno3d has only a single bios so flashing bios is more dangerous but it is the only true 2-slot 5070ti so it doesnt take extra pcie slot like other models. zotac i think also has single bios. palit also has problems accepting other bioses from one other redditor that wrote me about their palit.\n\nusually asus prime is not being sold for msrp, more like $850-900, for this price you might be able to get better models that also have features like 350W power limit that can help you reach up to 100mhz higher boost clock, but if you can get asus prime oc for $750 or around €800 in europe, i strongly believe it is the best msrp model you can get right now as it has no weaknesses, only strengths/benefits. But overall the differences between 5070ti models are fairly small, if you can get for example msi shadow $50 cheaper than all other models, i would still rather save the money and get the shadow, there is no point paying extra money for any models in my opinion.\n\nThe main 2 differences between 5070ti models are higher power limit and 2.5 vs 3.5 slot coolers, the 3.5 slot coolers should be able to cool the core to 60-65°C completely silently with fans spinning only 1000-1200rpm, whereas 2.5 slot coolers (like my windforce or asus prime) need like 1800rpm to reach 70°C on core which is definitely audible, not too loud but you will clearly hear the gpu work. If i lower the fan to 1200-1300rpm on my windforce, it gets close to 78-80°C on core which seems a bit high (mainly because apparently the hotspot is very hot on nvidia 50 series, which is why nvidia decided to completely remove the hotspot sensor which now incorrectly shows 255°C, so keeping the card cool and core below 65-70°C is more important than on other generations.",
      "Damage looks similar to what people were showing from that ASUS Q-release thing.  They might have sold him an open-box return as new.\n\nBad situation either way.",
      "Thanks for the explanation! You are awesome"

Feel free to ask any questions below if you have a question about something, however.\\* \n\nFor a larger breakdown of the different ASUS GeForce RTX 50 Series cards, including our GeForce RTX 5070 Ti cards, please check out [our previous thread covering the cards in greater detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1hw2osj/introducing_asus_geforce_rtx_50_series_graphics/).\n\nAlthough you can zoom below for the availability details, some of the information here in the FAQ may also be important for some of you. If there's something I missed or you think would help to add, please let me know below.\n\nIn the unlikely chance you didn't know, **the sales embargo for GeForce RTX 5070 Ti cards ends on 2/20 at 6AM PT.**\n\n**Q. Will ROG Strix GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Cards be available on 2/20?**  \nA. Unfortunately, the ROG Strix cards will not be available Day 1. There is currently no ETA for when these cards will be available, but we will update the post and/or the availability post in the comments when we have an update.\n\n**Q. Will these all be available on Day 1 as listed?**  \nA. We expect that most, if not all of these will be available at 6am PST for the US. Of course, things happen sometimes and a particular etailer or retailer may have a website issue or may be pending for stock to reach them. Feel free to ask later in the day and we can track this down.\n\n**Q. What about Canada Day 1 sales?**  \nA. For Canada, I do not have confirmation on which stores will have Day 1 stock at this time, unfortunately. If I receive confirmation before the end of the day I will update it.\n\n**Q. Will there be pre-orders?**  \nA. Not with this launch. If this changes, we'll provide an update.\n\n**Q. Any information about waterblocks?**  \nA. ASUS is working with all major waterblock manufacturers in preparation for the RTX 50 Series launch. It's important to note that unlike the previous RTX 40 Series, each graphics card uses a different PCB and will not likely share compatibility for the same waterblock design. However, we don’t have anything further to share at this time and it may be better to contact your preferred waterblock maker for details.\n\n**Q. Any information about ProArt, Dual, White cards, BTF etc.?**  \nA. As noted in our RTX 5090 / RTX 5080 availability post, we don't have information yet. Let’s instead break down the general range that we expect or know to expect for the GeForce RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 Ti (no spoilers for RTX 5070 just yet) –\n\n* ROG Astral – RTX 5090, RTX 5080\n* TUF Gaming – RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti\n* ASUS ProArt – RTX 5080 (no ETA or confirmation on all models)\n* ASUS Prime – RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti\n* BTF – Stay tuned for now.\n* White Cards – We will have them, but currently pending confirmation on the models and ETA. Stay tuned.\n\nAs we usually also note, we do listen to your feedback about what kinds of cards you want, whether you want to see more of a card series, additional white models (or fewer?), etc. Worst thing that can happen is that we choose not to take your advice, but we appreciate it and consider it for future models.\n\n**Q. Quick! What are the dimensions of the cards?**  \nA. Here you are -\n\nTUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti -\n\n* Metric: 329 x 140 x 62.5 mm\n* Imperial: 12.95 x 5.51 x 2.46 inch\n* Slot Size: 3.125 Slots\n\nASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti –\n\n* Metric: 304 x 126 x 50 mm\n* Imperial: 12 x 5 x 2 inch\n* Slot Size: 2.5 Slot\n\n**Q. Last Question! Which ASUS GeForce RTX 5070 Ti cards have dual HDMI 2.1b ports?**  \nA. The TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti cards do.

      "As much as I want to dog on ASUS as a brand for these prices, I really do wonder what Nvidia has done to these board partners behind the scenes to take us to this point. Pretty much the second EVGA got out this started to happen and it looks terrible on *every* brand.\n\nGoing to pay close attention to Asus' pricing of the 9070 & 9070 XT. If those are priced at AMDs MSRP, we'll know who to blame. If its marked up 25% again, what a terrible destruction of brand reputation to chase short term revenue.",

      "So the Prime card did not drop on launch day? What gives? ($749.99)",
      "The price is based off what people are willing to pay. Really, really simple. Retailers only get a limited number of cards in a given time period. If they sell all of it too fast, there’s nothing left to sell when they could’ve priced it higher.",

      "Why don't the 5080 and 5090 get this treatment?",
      "I did mention above that we have confirmed there will be white edition cards, but we don't have a list of the models yet. You are also correct that we don't yet have an ETA for the ROG Strix GeForce 5070 Ti, but I have not heard of a change to release this model, so it's just a matter of staying tuned.",

      "Just really don't understand Asus pricing logic... The TUF 4070 super was $599, while the TUF 4070 super was $650. Now you're saying the Prime 5070 ti is $750, but the Prime 5070 ti OC is $939. Can you answer why the same model card... (Not TUF or Strix model) warrants that much of a price increase for the OC?\n\nCan't even imagine what the Strix model price will be if the TUF model is at $1000. Anymore and then that you'd be better off getting a 5080...",

    "selftext": "I’m on the hunt for a RTX 5070 TI. I noticed that companies like Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte have their own versions of the GPU with price change (+-250$). Why do they do that? I know the boost in OverClocking can be around +156. Are there any other differences, like in the cooling system, that I’m not aware of? 🤔\n\nI need this card to run MSFS 2024 in 4K for long flights. So, maybe it’s worth splurging on a better GPU cooling system (+150$) to make sure it can handle the demands.\n\nThanks for your help! ",
    "comments": [
      "TUF is 25 dBA while Ventus is 41dBA, if you're fine with the card being twice as loud go for it.",
      "Both have a triple fan cooling design, and the temperature difference **will not** make or break the card.\n\nPersonally, I'd buy the cheaper one because they both will have temperatures that are more than acceptable compared to the temperature limit of the card.",
      "I have the shadow 3x and the temps and noise has been no problem so far I got mine for msrp so I was ok with not as fancy as other cards. I also personally like that the card is all matte black and not super thick it’s just better for my case.",
      "So if I get it right \nIt better to found like the ASUs prime at MSRP",
      "The reason they change the price is so that they can make money because you're paying for a better cooling design, factory OC, etc.\n\nAs for the difference in cards, arguably, maybe one performs *very slightly* better or worse than the other, but it's generally not enough of a difference to pay an even higher premium for the card.\n\nTLDR: The differences between cards *can vary slightly,* but for the general consumer, it's not enough to warrant paying a higher premium. Get the card you can find in stock at the price you're okay paying, both will be fine.",
      "Some cards especially msrp ones are power locked. The only 5070 ti that is not power locked and is sold at kinda MSRP is the Asus Prime.",
      "I have a shadow 3x and the performance/temperature is fine with undervolt OC",
      "I got the shadow 3x yesterday and have been very happy with it. I don’t believe I can unlock the power limit but I have overlocked it +300 and the memory +2000 with no issues at all. It’s quiet, low temp, the overclock gives like +10% with no problems at all.",
      "Oh really \nWhat specs are you using ?",
      "I found it to be a bit loud over 60% fan speed. Non issue if you use headphones. Temps are great avg around 65 under full load for half hour in gaming test (plague take requiem at 4K no upscale). I’ve been messing with the fan curve. I’ll update with a sweet spot if I find one. I might check out a flat 30% fan speed just to see what happens because it’s super quiet at that speed and I could live with 70-75 degree temps.",
      "How do u mean?",
      "Changed my fan curve. Hovers around 35% fan speed from 40-69 then kicks up around 75 degrees. Have yet to hit 75. Have yet to hit over 70 really. Great card so far. Bought mine for 835. Highly recommended at this price at the moment. However, only toime will tell. Noise is a non-issue without headphones. As others have said case fans contribute more than the card. Plus I air cool my 9800x3d with a TR PA se. love that thing. 35 bucks and the things a champ.",

I’m looking to build my first Gaming PC. going for the Shadow GPU and need a cooler for an Intel i7-14700k. I’m going to under-vault and contemplating one of these. But, I noticed a few different ones. This is all new to me, but slowly building a list of components for upto £2k that I’m hopefully going to be happy with.",
      "I can't find any good reviews, but Shadow has less heatpipes than Ventus, so maybe it's even louder?",

Obviously in the OPs case the price difference is also negligible, hence my stance in my last paragraph.",

      "They are about the same in practical performance.\n\nNerds can compare the heatsink and coolers but it’s going to be sufficient in either case.\n\nGigabyte claims the Windforce as SFF but it has the same physical dimensions as the other MSRP cards from Asus (Prime) and MSI (Shadow 3x).\n\nThat said I would get the Palit if the price is about the same. It’s bigger than the MSRP cards from the big 3.",

it may therefore be disputed through other channels;\n\n>**Point 5:** It is true that no exclusions are indicated, and in fact in America even FE cards benefit from this code – in our region, NVIDIA does not provide this promotion because it does not sell products directly but through LDLC, which is a vendor like any other and does not participate in this promotion in Italy – this too is the response of those with expertise on the matter, and therefore cannot be contested via this channel;\n\n>**Point 6:** In Italy, LDLC is the only one selling Founders Editions, whereas in other countries the Founders Editions are sold by other companies; in Europe, it is not possible to purchase directly from the NVIDIA store and one must go through these resellers; in America, it is possible to purchase directly from the NVIDIA store – if you look on the LDLC website, you will not find Founders Editions listed, so the response from LDLC customer service stating “only for customers who placed an order on the LDLC France site” refers to custom cards, not Founders Editions.\n\n>That said, I understand why you insist, but I reiterate that this information/these responses are final as they come from the competent department.\n\n>Therefore, they cannot be contested through this communication channel, but you may dispute them through consumer protection agencies or other means.\n\n# Here's my answer:\n\n>Thank you for your response, but I cannot accept what you wrote as “definitive,” because it contains several statements contradicted by the official Terms and Conditions and by the information published on NVIDIA’s Italian website. Below I reply point by point:\n\n**01. The existence of the promo page does not prove that FE cards are included**\n\n>Correct: nowhere is it stated that FE cards are included.  \nBut it is also **nowhere stated that they are excluded**. The terms clearly state:\n\n>“Offer valid for desktop systems or NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, 5070 graphics cards…”\n\n>The Founders Edition **is** an RTX 5070. If there were any exclusions, they should have been listed. The absence of such an exclusion is meaningful.\n\n>Moreover, on the product page of the NVIDIA Marketplace, the RTX 5070 Founders Edition displayed the **“DOOM INCLUDED”** banner.\n\n**02. The T&Cs only mention the territory, not the inclusion of FE cards**\n\n>Exactly: they neither exclude nor mention FE cards, but **explicitly include Europe**.\n\n>The fact that the promotion is “valid in Europe at authorized partners and resellers” implies that purchases made in Europe from such partners (like LDLC) are eligible.\n\n**03. Not all partners participate, and LDLC is not listed at the bottom of the page**\n\n>But the page **does not exclude LDLC** — it simply does not mention it among the resellers in the United States and Canada (the list is clearly for the North American region).\n\n>Additionally:\n\n>My card was purchased through the **Italian NVIDIA Marketplace**, **not directly from LDLC’s website**.\n\n>The **“DOOM included”** banner was visible on the RTX 5070 product page at the time of purchase.\n\n>This is official promotional material, **not a mistake**.\n\n>\n\n>**04. The banner is present, but not related to EMEA**\n\n>This is a very serious statement:\n\n>The banner is on the **Italian NVIDIA Marketplace**, not the American one.\n\n>The website was **localized in Italian** and included the phrase “DOOM incluso”.\n\n>So NVIDIA **advertised the promotion in Italy, in the Italian language, on a site aimed at the Italian public**, and now claims that the promotion does not apply in this country.\n\n>This is, in effect, **misleading advertising**.\n\n>\n\n>**05. In the U.S. FE cards are included, in Europe they are not**\n\n>Once again:\n\n>If FE cards are excluded in Europe, this **must be stated in the T&Cs**.\n\n>If FE cards are excluded in Europe, they **should not have a banner** indicating they are part of the promotion.\n\n>There is **no clause** that limits the offer to “custom” cards.\n\n>Stating that the promotion applies in the U.S. but not in Europe, without this distinction being reflected in the official documents, **exposes NVIDIA to legal responsibility**.\n\n>\n\n>**06. FE cards in Europe are not sold directly by NVIDIA, so they are not valid**\n\n>But I did **not** purchase from LDLC.\n\n>I purchased from the **Italian NVIDIA website**.\n\n>And on that site, the **“DOOM included”** banner was present.\n\n>The fact that NVIDIA relies on LDLC for order fulfillment **does not change the nature of the offer made to the consumer**.\n\n>\n\n>**Conclusion**\n\n>The fact that you keep stating that the response is “not open to dispute” **does not make the claim correct**, nor does it negate the responsibilities that arise from misleading advertising. I will therefore proceed with a **report to AGCM** (the Italian Competition and Market Authority), and if necessary, to the **European Consumer Centre**.\n\n>I remain available in case NVIDIA decides to resolve this issue amicably.\n\n# And again, NVIDIA's response\n\n>\n\nI kindly ask you not to misuse this support service.\n\n>As I have already explained, this is not the appropriate channel to dispute this matter.\n\n>Therefore, I ask you not to proceed any further in this way, as your messages amount to venting dissatisfaction to people who are no longer in a position to help you – and that is not the purpose of my job.\n\n>The information I have provided to you is final, and there is no room to contest it through this channel.\n\n>Again, I ask you not to abuse the service being offered to you.\n\n>If you wish to confirm what I have told you, you may contact the channels I’ve already provided:\n\n>[info@nvidia.com](mailto:info@nvidia.com)\n\n>[https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/support/consumer/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/support/consumer/)\n\n>Thank you again for your understanding, and I hope you take into consideration what I have written.\n\n>This case is now considered closed.",

All GPUs turn off fans on idle. Under load none is actually loud.           \nThe 4 non-MSRP GPUs tested are around 2-5 % faster on average than the MSRP model in 4K. Memory speeds are the same as MSRP model i.e. 2334 MHz.   \n    \nModels Tested:      \n1) ASUS TUF Gaming OC RTX 5070 Ti - 3 slots thick, 329 mm long, excellent build quality, RGB, Dual BIOS, 2nd HDMI port, GPU holder. 2nd fastest i.e. 3.1 % faster than \"MSRP\" model (in 4K games average).

Slightly faster than the rest i.e. 4.4% faster than \"MSRP\" model (in 4K games average). Uses 8-10 % more power than MSRP model. Runs cooler than the rest (by a small margin)                 \n3) Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti Gaming OC - 3.5 slots thick, 340 mm long, Dual BIOS, GPU holder, RGB, 1 extra year of warranty (total 4 yrs). Uses 8-10 % more power than MSRP model. 2nd quietest on \"Quiet\" BIOS             \n4) MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X OC - **\"MSRP\"** model, 2.5 slots thick, 303 mm long, Metal backplate, No RGB, No Dual BIOS, comes with GPU holder. Uses the least amount of power. Loudest card.

I’m seriously considering this option, but I wanted to get your thoughts.\n\n**My current setup with the RTX 4070 Ti:**\n\n* I'm running it with a custom curve, flattened at 1000mV.\n* With this setup, I get around 2790-2805 MHz at 1000mV (+165 offset on the core clock).\n* Power consumption is 226W, which is 13% lower than the TDP, and I see about a 5% boost in performance.\n\n**What I’ve heard about the RTX 5070:**\n\n* The RTX 5070 seems to have a massive overclocking potential (e.g., +400 MHz boost on the core clock).\n* I’ve read it offers about a 10% performance gain when overclocked.\n* However, stock for stock, the RTX 5070 is about 5% slower in ray tracing performance compared to the 4070 Ti.\n\n**My question:**  \nIf I undervolt and overclock the RTX 5070 to keep its power consumption under 230W, could I potentially get better performance compared to my current overclocked and undervolted RTX 4070 Ti (which runs at 226W with a 5% performance boost)?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this!",

      "Pretty good. Flash the PNY Triple Fan OC bios using nvflash, then bump the power limit and OC from there using msi afterburner. Slowly increase clocks until it’s unstable, then take it down to the highest clock it’s stable at, maybe -50mhz for more consistency. You can usually just set the full + 2000 on memory with most cards, core will vary depending on your sample.",
      "No it's pretty normal for the RTX 50 series. These cards overclock very well! Look up reviews on websites or check some youtube vids.",
      "Download MSI Afterburner, make sure you select the Beta Version of the 2 options. Once you have installed it, jump on YouTube and watch a few tutorials.",
      "From what I see, most of these cards actually overclock really well.",
      "Is the nvflash needed? I just cranked the other day my 5070 ti to 3000 mhz core clock in afterburner and the memory from 14k to 15k, basically did +210 mhz in core and +1000 mhz in memory and saved it, everything seems stable",
      "Wonderful, ty for the answer! So first download nvflash and then msi afterburner.\n\nIs there a condition to OC? I mean in the MB, PSU or cooling aspect?",
      "Ty so much!!",
      "No, but it can let you increase the power limit on power limit locked cards to push clocks even higher.",
      "You can try +350-400 on Core and bump the memory up with +2000. Memory should be absolutely stable there. If you crash just use +300 on Core. But most cards do +350 on core easily.",
      "Cooling can effect max overclock sometimes (hence why LN2 is used for world record OC attempts), PSU and cables can effect your power limit (if you’re using a 2x8pin to 12VHPWR, you may want a 3x8 or 4x8 cable instead as one 8pin is only rated for 150 watts each. They can usually exceed that by a bit fine though). I have no issue with power limit headroom on an 850w unit though.  Motherboard…as long as you have PCIE 5.0, it should have little to no impact whatsoever on GPU overclocking.",
      "ahhh ok, nice to know, thanks :D",
      "Wouldn't that be too much? My card is an OC version so it does not come at 2450 mhz came at 2750 mhz or something like that, now with the +210 it sits right at 3000 mhz which I think is enough, I don't want to push things too much, just me being paranoid xD"

      "2023 GN put out a hit piece of LTT for rushing out content and making lots of mistakes and various other issues. It felt like the stance lmg had at the time was \"who cares\" and Linus instead of actually thinking about the criticism doubled down on ignoring the complaints which made the whole thing 100x worse. They took a week or so off to re-evaluate how they produce content and get rid of their commitment to daily video uploads and focus more on releasing a video when its ready.  \n\n\nThen the recent honey drama brought on by MegaLag’s video. Linus used to be sponsored by honey (so did most of youtube) and they figured out honey was sniping affiliate revenue so they cut ties with them and made a post on their forum. This was years ago before any of the information about honey keeping better coupons from consumers was known. GN made another hit piece focusing on Linus and how since he didn't do an expose at the time and as a result is the devil. He made a bunch of claims about journalism and professionalism, then when Steve got called out he removed his claims about being a tech journalist from his website, much in the same way he called EK out for covering up things by editing their website after being exposed.  \n\n\nThere are pretty much 2 camps people are in now. Either Linus and LMG are the devil, or Steve and GN is the devil. Discussions about how both sides have points are met by the fan boys from each camp.",
      "they have a history of getting numbers wrong in their own tests, and there was some personal drama around linus recently",
      "Linus was also a pretty insufferable prick about a few things.   I unsubbed after the \"we don't need a warrantee, just trust me, bro\" stuff he tripled down on despite Luke trying to rein him in multiple times. \n\n\nHe's also been vocally anti-union under the guise of \"if a union needs to exist, the business failed.\"  Which is just another \"trust me bro\" but instead of backpacks, it's labor practices.  The best time to form a union is when all things are running well and agreements are easy to reach.",
      "Wait why do people hate LTT lol",
      "Honestly there are reviewers and there are influencers and I am sure this will garner a lot of disdain but Linus is an influencer first and foremost and a reviewer 2nd. And while has has been trying to rectify this with the labs the content is still on the level of influencer even after letting us know repeatedly how much money he has spent on the labs.  \n\nBtw I say influencer because he does paid content for the same people he reviews although it is a seperate video yadda yadda he is still doing paid content and using his channel to sell vs inform.   \n\n  \nThere are some that fall into one camp or the other and some that straddle both but that's my read on the situation.",
      "I thought the 70 Ti was basically Nvidia throwing the AIB partners a bone, because Nvidia wouldn't be \"outcompeting\" them with an FE model that keeps the real MSRP.\n\nIt's a model where the AIB partners basically have a license to make as much margin as they can possibly squeeze customers for, without Nvidia competing with them on that model.",
      "They never switched channels as they matured. Like expecting Sesame Street to mature with you instead of moving on and letting the new gen of kids have their fun.",
      "Because GN made a hit piece about them getting data wrong in charts & other stuff. However GN failed to fact check their own story so made a major factual error in the video which they never bothered correcting.",
      "Fair take, but there's valid criticisms outside of that too that are worth mentioning, like how LMG was explicitly aware of how Honey was scamming creators/anyone using promotional discount codes and kept it to themselves seemingly because it didn't benefit them to bring it to everyone's attention",
      "Funnily enough their Blackwell coverage was much more in depth than some other \"mature\" outlets. The gaming suite wasn't as wide, but instead of reading charts for 20 minutes LTT went wide and covered AI, media  and other \"productive\" tests most other sites haven't touched. Plus in this video Linus covers nVidia issues like blackscreens and burning connectors people outside of the hobby most likely don't know about. And they do it it in less than half the time.\n\nLTT is more popular science kind of outlet with wider reach. It puts some limits on their content. But I wouldn't dismiss them so easily. Their recent reviews are pretty thorough.",
      "Lmao “homework.” Yeah, you seem like the type whose homework consistent of clickbait trash from techtubers",
      "A bit of a misrepresentation of what Linus said on unions. He was specifically taking about LMG and that he would feel he failed as a boss if the employees felt they needed a union. That isn’t being anti-union, he also specifically said he wouldn’t (and couldn’t) try to stop one. This was also when LMG was smaller than it is now",
      "But they admitted no one watched the whole thing.",
      "He’s a piece of shit",
      "low quality content despite constantly promising high quality content.\n\nalso basically runied a company. Reviewing their product incorrectly and then giving said product away instead of sending it back to them",
      "Did they no alsot have some issues with woman employe also? Some video or voice was leaked with his wife and full team doing statement?",
      "What's more is that this fued was all set off by a few boastful comments by LTT staff that were disparaging of GN at a time when LTT was building out their testing labs to catch up.\n\n\nGN's reputation is built on three pillars: consumer advocacy, humor, and honest and reliable testing. So, attacking one of the things GN relies on to make money didn't go over well with Steve (especially when it was LTT who was lacking), resulting first in a rebuttal then the aforementioned hit piece.\n\n\nLTT could have avoided the whole thing by keeping their mouth shut, apologizing for their staff's comments, or framing the comments as joking rivalry.\n\n\nI was legitimately suprised when Steve didn't just joke back, but I guess Linus decided to stick his foot so far down his mouth that it became both personal and professional for Steve.",
      "The incorrect testing and failed return of the heat sink is on record, though.",
      "Don't forgot the whole prototype scandal",
      "This is bar for bar the GN misinformation words. Just incredible stuff."

      "SFF is just a marketing catch, they're not \"specifically designed for SFF cases\". They'll work in any case. The reason they exist is because they're cheaper to build (smaller cooler = cheaper cooler) and cheaper to ship. So, in essence, what they are is, quite simply, budget cards. No wonder all the \"SFF\" models from Gigabyte are popping up when you research GPUs by price.\n\nWith every AIB manufacturer, you'll notice entry level cards use smaller, cheaper coolers, usually just 2 slots thick (while bigger models are 3-4 slots thick) and sometimes featuring 2-fan designs instead of 3 fans, yet, most of them aren't calling them SFF. What Gigabyte has decided to do is to cleverly call their entry-level cooler design \"SFF\"; this makes it sound sophisticated, as in \"this was designed to fit into fancy SFF builds\", when all it really is is a entry-level cooler design.\n\nAnd yes, entry-level SKUs have always been the preferred models by SFF builders because entry-level SKUs are the smaller ones.

I had no idea but found that info pretty quickly when I started looking into the brand. So those are definitely not \"niche brands\".\n\nPlus I remember from my PC games/hardware reviewing days that we had a Gainward Golden Sample card in the office for review way back in 2004 or so, so the brand has definitely been around for a while.\n\nPersonally, I wanted to stay away from them or any other MSRP-ish models from other manufacturers as I prefer my cards a bit overbuilt and with plenty of tacky RGB. My last two cards were/are GB Gaming OC models. But since those still command quite ridiculous premiums in my country I went with something a little more affordable. \n\nBoth Gaming OC and MSI Gaming Trio are currently EUR 940 over here while the non-OC Palit is 829 and the OC-version is 849.

Read here!\n\n**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**\n\nThere is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).\n\n**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**\n\n**Common Troubleshooting Steps**\n\n* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11\n* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.\n* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance\n\nIf it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:\n\n* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.\n* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.\n* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.\n\nIf you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.\n\n**Common Questions**\n\n* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*\n\n**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**\n\n* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*\n* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*\n* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*\n\nRemember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.\n\n*Did you know NVIDIA has a Developer Program with 150+ free SDKs, state-of-the-art Deep Learning courses, certification, and access to expert help. Sound interesting?* [Learn more here](https://nvda.ws/3wCfH6X)*.*",

That would help drive down the price for gaming gpus.",

Which should stop people from pitching about the vram all the time.\n\nSo 5060 12gb\n\n 5070 18gb\n\n 5080 24gb\n\n 5090 32gb or 48",

      "And with GDDR7, you're also getting more bandwidth. So even with a mere 128 bit bus, the 5060 shouldn't be as starved as the 4060/Ti cards \n\nNVIDIA could also pull a joker with DLSS 4. Last year, they presented a neural based compression algorythm for textures. With the same VRAM usage, you can get much better textures.... or on the other hand, you could get away with the same texture with 5 to 10 times less VRAM usage on this particular textures. \n\nAI powered compression and GDDR7 are about to save NVIDIA's ass for all that lack of VRAM talk",

      "The way NVIDIA works, the 5080 will be almost as expensive as a 4090 and the 5090 is going to be the price of a cheap used car.",
      "Nvidias neural texture compression is not something the GPU applies to normal textures inside its VRAM, instead it’s essentially a whole new texture format. It would be on the developer to encode neural textures and distribute them as part of the game or a texture pack.",

      "600W is probably the absolute max the chip is going to consume under extreme OC.",
      "Anything less than 5080GB will be a disappointment.\n\n\nReally though, I do hope it has at least 20GB and 24GB would be great. The price won't be, but yeah.",

      "The moment they made the GB203 die 256-bit wide, they made 16GB pretty much inevitable. Increasing the bus width is pretty expensive in terms of die size, but they should have really made the die be a bit wider.  \n\nThe other failure, imo, is on the memory manufacturers. 3GB GDDR7 chips really should have been the standard right away. That would have given a hypothetical 5080 24GB of VRAM (and been a lot better further down the stack). But it seems like the 3GB chips are like 6 months too late to be used more generally.  \n\nAnd don't worry about all the weird comments you got on pricing. This sub (and most of reddit) has just thrown out random guesses that often just keep going higher. I would say that the 4080 Super pricing shows they learned something, and the TSMC node being used is only a slight upgrade (and so should have similar pricing to the node used for the 4000 series). GDDR7 is almost certainly more expensive, but the GB203 die feels designed to keep size reasonable and hopefully price down.  \n\nRather than talking about anything related to costs, though, people have instead thrown out numbers based on nothing or lately have reacted to the price \"leaks.\" Those leaks are almost surely placeholder prices, as has happened many times before. However, if the 1600 Euro price is real, people also seem to be ignoring that it was for an Asus model that is always priced significantly higher than MSRP.  \n\nThe only caveats is that tariffs could throw pricing completely out of whack, but that's a separate issue.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/196aeo2b53ge1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=da05b4e9b4b1a53b38488c81e9fee744ee2baa4b\n\n\\*Note to everyone - this is a post in progress as I'm rushing to get the most important details for those of you planning your day tomorrow (edit - today...). So, please let me know if something is missing and forgive a bit of marketing copypasta for the moment.\\* \n\nFor a larger breakdown of the different ASUS GeForce RTX 50 Series cards, please check [our previous thread covering the cards in greater detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1hw2osj/introducing_asus_geforce_rtx_50_series_graphics/).\n\nAlthough you can zoom below for the availability details, some of the information here in the FAQ may also be important for some of you. If there's something I missed or you think would help to add, please let me know below.\n\n**Q. Will these all be available on Day 1 as listed?**  \nA. We expect that most, if not all of these will be available at 6am PST for the US. Of course, things happen sometimes and a particular etailer or retailer may have a website issue or may be pending for stock to reach them. Feel free to ask later in the day and we can track this down.\n\n**Q. What about Canada Day 1 sales?**  \nA. We do know more about CA stock in terms of what we expect to be in store on Day 1 and what is on its way. Short answer is that Canadians may need to wait a little for our GeForce RTX 5090 cards, but there will be some GeForce RTX 5080 cards available Day 1:\n\nFor Best Buy (CA):\n\n* TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5080 OC Edition\n\nFor Memory Express and Canada Computers:\n\n* TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5080 OC Edition\n* ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5080 OC Edition\n\n**Q. When should we expect the rest in CA?**  \nA. The shipments are currently on their way, but will likely take between 1-2 weeks to arrive (expect closer to 2 weeks)\n\n**Q. Will there be pre-orders?**  \nA. Not with this launch. If this changes, we'll provide an update.\n\nYes, there has been some commentary about certain AIBs may be doing a pre-order, but it won't be before the 1/30 6AM PT embargo time. If we do pre-orders in future waves, we will try to provide this information ahead of time.\n\n**Q. Any information about waterblocks?**  \nA. ASUS is working with all major waterblock manufacturers in preparation for the RTX 50 Series launch. It's important to note that unlike the previous RTX 40 Series, each graphics card uses a different PCB and will not likely share compatibility for the same waterblock design. However, we don’t have anything further to share at this time and it may be better to contact your preferred waterblock maker for details..\n\n**Q. Any information about ProArt, Dual, White cards, BTF etc.? When is the next wave of cards coming in after this one?**  \nA. Sorry everyone, I had hoped to have more information about those questions by the on-shelf date, but I don’t have any concrete dates or times. Let’s instead break down the general range that we expect or know to expect for the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 (no spoilers for the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 just yet) –\n\n* ROG Astral – RTX 5090, RTX 5080\n* TUF Gaming – RTX 5090, RTX 5080\n* ASUS ProArt – RTX 5080 (no ETA yet)\n* ASUS Prime – RTX 5080\n* BTF – Stay tuned for now.\n* White Cards – We will have them, but currently pending confirmation on the models and ETA. Stay tuned.\n\nAs we usually also note, we do listen to your feedback about what kinds of cards you want, whether you want to see more of a card series, additional white models (or fewer?), etc. Worst thing that can happen is that we choose not to take your advice, but we appreciate it and consider it for future models.\n\n**Q.

      "Reserving this post for future stock updates.\n\nEdit 2/19 - I would have liked to update this more frequently, but graphics cards don't necessarily arrive in shipments like some of our other products do, such as monitors, which often come in waves - except for the first couple of shipments after launch.\n\nAfter the first couple of waves that have already come in, all of the initial etail and retail partners should have received stock and sold out.\n\nThe ASUS eShop should now correctly have links to all models that have been available, if you want to keep the pages open or bookmark them.\n\nAt this point, we're receiving shipments of our RTX 50 Series cards weekly and shipping out to etail, retail, and selling some through our eShop. For that reason, it's difficult to keep a running stock update for when you should expect to see certain GPUs or certain models at specific stores as stock will constantly be in transit. It's also important to remember that due to logistics, stores will receive stock at different times. Regardless, we are continually putting more cards into the channel, even if it still seems painfully slow for many of you. This means you just need to keep your eyes out for the model or models you want to purchase. \n\nI will also note that I'm still waiting to hear news about our white edition cards, ProArt cards, and any other unique models that we will eventually sell, but I have a feeling that we'll probably make a new post when these details are readily available.",

It's not that any one of the features jumps up and bridges the price difference, but the totality of the ROG Astral design begins to add up to the difference in price.\n\nThe other factor to consider is that the cooling performance in reviews is essentially a Day 1 snapshot. Over time, many factors come into play that will affect performance and cooling (such as repeatable build quality and design), and this is one of the reasons we chose to go with phase change thermal pads because it will provide the longest sustained performance and consistency among choices for cooling the GPU, not to mention easier for end-users to clean if they take the card apart.\n\nIt's a perfectly reasonable position to take that the MSI Suprim, for example, may be more to your liking because it's cheaper and seems to cool quite well in reviews, but I think the Astral cards also provide value for those looking for a bit more in an already expensive card.",
      "Now, what do those Astral cards do that an FE does not?",
      "Well, since you asked...\n\n**Card and aesthetic design:**\n\n* The ROG Astral uses a CNC-milled exterior on the die-cast metal shroud, frame and backplate.\n* Look closely at the shroud, frame and backplate to see how the card is able to self-sustain its shape with reinforced bracing while also protecting itself against torsion; essentially preventing sag while also providing integrity to the PCB to combat micro-fractures for long-term stability\n* Blacked-out heatsinks\n* Prismatic filter RGB Lighting\n\n**PCB Design:**\n\n* [The power delivery system is always much more involved on ROG cards to provide better power delivery and monitoring, including 80A MOSFETs](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-5090-astral/5.html)\n* Sensors are embedded in the PCB to track GPU, memory, and VRM temps and viewable in GPU Tweak III via the Thermal Map functionality\n* 16-pin PCIe power connector monitoring is included to verify that your power connector is fully-seated and can notify you even which pin is not seated properly in GPU Tweak III via a tool called Power Detector+\n* A conformal coating is applied to the PCB to help protect the card from short-circuits caused by dust, liquid, and debris\n* Let's not forget that the card includes a pair of FanConnect II PWM headers and two HDMI 2.1b ports\n* The GPU Guard also helps to keep the processor securely attached to the socket for long-term stability. Why is this an issue? With the size and length of cards these days, the weight can cause some level of bowing and microfractures inside the GPU socket, ultimately leading to failure.\n\n**Cooling Design:**\n\n* For brevity, I won't go into much detail about the quad-fans, vapor chamber design, heatsinks, fins, etc. because testing results already show that the ROG Astral is excellent for cooling - especially in comparison to the Founders Edition.\n* Phase Change thermal pads are used for the GPU, while others are trying liquid metal, combinations of liquid metal and thermal paste. This matters because the phase change thermal pads have significantly greater longevity than thermal paste does and is much, much easier to clean up than liquid metal paste if you ever decide to open up your card. Liquid metal can cool better, but not by much (and we tested), but is a lot harder to clean up.\n* Some of you may have also caught that we're using a thermal pad on the backside of the 16pin power connector to reduce heat during normal operation.\n* Speaking of thermal pads, the ROG Astral includes [more than a few on the backplate](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-5090-astral/4.html).\n\nThere are plenty of reasons that you might prefer the Founders Edition over the Astral, and we completely understand that, but there are also a lot of reasons to like the ROG Astral GeForce RTX 50 Series models, as well.",
      "I don't know the stock quantity to be honest, and I wouldn't be able to disclose much detail if I did. Trying to gauge the first day of a new NVIDIA release is difficult, as even a lot of stock can sell out very quickly.\n\nFor restocks, I asked our team yesterday, but it's too soon to provide next restock information. However, I'll keep this post updated and I reserved a comment for stock updates, provided it doesn't get downvoted.",
      "Okay it still doesn't explain why the performance is so bad for the price. This thing should obliterate every other card for the premium",
      "GPU clock speed and price. I don't think we will update the clock speeds until after the sales embargo lifts later this morning.",
      "I hope you will consider 5090 ProArt. Love the look but disappointed it's only for 5080.",
      "There is two sku for the Tuf edition 5090, the OC and none OC but I can't seem to find the actual difference between the two. Could you please elaborate? Only the OC has a tech spec online.",
      "You should have this amazon page corrected, showing incorrect title and specs. Should be Prime Non-OC, but shows as Tuf  \n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTPG3B1N](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTPG3B1N)",
      "I'll check with our team tomorrow to confirm, but the list I have doesn't show that sku at Best Buy tomorrow.\n\nEdit - Great question. Seems like one model was left of the list I received, but I can't confirm yet if it was specifically that model.",
      "Can you even see any of the 5000 series on their shop?",
      "I did ask, but currently no end date has been set for the pricing. If/when I hear that changes, I'll update the information.",
      "Unfortunately, I cover only the US/CA region. You'll need to reach out to your local ASUS sales team for further information on that side."

      "9070 XT",
      "You’re much better off trying to find a 4080 or 90 because all of the GPUs you’re considering are being scalped to high hell and back while potentially having missing ROPs, which is only verifiable after purchase with GPU-Z.",
      "I'm willing to wait for the 5000 series since it's supposed to be more tailored to using AI, I'm patient enough that I won't buy from scalpers and I'll run GPU-Z on any card I purchase directly from Canada Computers so I can return it without any issues.",
      "Where I live 40 series cards are being scalped just as much, to the point that they are not a viable option anymore.",
      "Exactly what you have said. \nI'm basically trying to see what if any difference there is in the performance between the 5070/5070ti/5080, when it comes to Creative digital/motion design that is assisted with AI tools. If the time difference/performance isn't too drastic between the 5070 & 5080, I rather just get the 5070 and put the extra money towards a new design drawing tablet like a Wacom cintiq, or an XP-PEN. For me the hardest thing to decide is the value of how fast the GPU will render or produce images compared to how much it will cost and if it is worth that cost.",
      "Check out Puget Systems on the web. Here is a link to a pertinent article from them.\n\nhttps://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/do-graphic-and-motion-designers-need-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus/",
      "I have little experience with applications like hers, but comming from 3D design, 20% or so improvement doesn’t matter much. I would pick the 5070ti+tablet any day over the 5080",
      "https://a.co/d/b8oewNP\n\nDon't know about what gpu you choose but this is an absolute bang for your buck choice psu",
      "regarding performance and price...\n\n5070 is 20-30% less than a 5070 Ti\n\n5070 Ti is 10-15% less than a 5080\n\npricewise (Amazon.com pricing)...\n\n5070 is selling for around $150 over MSRP\n\n5070 Ti is selling for around  $250 Nvidia's MSRP\n\n5080 is selling for well over $500 over MSRP.",
      "9070xt",
      "since every single AMD meatrider will say the 9070xt\n\ni’d say the 5080. the 5070 Ti barely beats the 4080 so the 5080 is sorta the only reasonable option until you get to the 5090 but even then that’s not reasonable for most\n\nyou PC can handle it hardware wise but you need a new PSU",
      "So I finally backordered a Asus Prime 5080 for MSRP, $1669 at Bestbuy. I managed to also buy a Samsung 9100 Pro 1TB PCIE 5.0 NVMe M.2 for my operating system main drive and am relegating my Samsung 990 Evo plus for storage. The 9100 should work amazing with the 5080 for great speeds. Just have to wait till May 23rd as that is the expected date of shipping. The last time I built a PC was nine years ago, but it's just as fun now as it was then. Just so much harder to get a good GPU than it was when I bought my GTX 1080.",
      "Thanks for the answer. For me if the 5090 actually doubles the speed of my wife's work then I would actually consider it even though it's very expensive. But if the difference isn't at least that then I'm more inclined to the 5800. If the 5800 doesn't have much difference in speed compared to the 5070ti since they have the same VRAM then I think that would be my most logical choice. Though I was reading the CUDA cores makes a difference too when it comes to AI. \nThe 5070 is tempting price wise but with AI the more VRAM the better from what I understand so far.",
      "4080 and 4090 are also being scalped to high hell lol. This is a bad recommendation. 5070ti is also basically 4080 but smidge better, but cheaper price (I got one at $820) Missing ROPs is overblown and takes seconds to verify, it's annoying but relatively small percentage and not a reason to completely skip a generation of cards.\n\nOP is also specifically after AI features, which *is* the big leap from 4 series to 5 series. You're just regurgitating Reddit hivemind vomit, when OP's situation is basically the opposite of vanilla case (gamers)",
      "Thanks checking it out now!",
      "I'm planning on trying over the next few months to hold out for a 5080 at MSRP. If I'm patient enough I hope I can grab one. I have until September when my wife comes back from Japan to finish building it. At the minimum I will do 5070ti, but the extra decoder in the 5080 is what is making me lean in its favour. I'm definitely not going to pay scalper prices.",
      "Was actually thinking about it but then saw that using AI with it is a pain.",
      "Yeah I noticed the trolls really love posting that I should get the 9070xt. \n\nMy plan is to get the 5080, I would really love to get the FE edition but that is looking like next to impossible since you can only buy them from BestBuy, hell I would get the 5090 if I could get the FE edition from BestBuy but they are never in stock\n\n I've replaced the PSU with a super flower 1200watt Leadex VII Pro. So I am ready for the 5080 or 5090 if I can ever get it at MSRP for the FE edition. If I can't buy the beginning of September, I'll bite the bullet and grab a partner 5080.",
      "You read the post right? I am running a 9070xt that i picked up on launch day for MSRP and I love it. I wanted so badly to say just get that but he isn’t using this card for gaming. It’s going to be used for work and for AI, that means he’s going to be better served with an nvidia card."

That's roughly 50%. Now $1000 divided by $2000 is 50%. However, 512 bit bus and 32gb of vram here as well get doubled. \n\nThe first is a comparison between the 5070ti and the 5080. The second is a comparison between the 5080 and 5090. \n\nThe basic thing here is that a 5070ti is around 83% of the cuda cores of a 5080 and has the same vram, bus width, etc of the 5080. So, the 5070ti costs 25% less for 83%+ of the performance (likely to be an even narrower gap than 17%). \n\nMeanwhile, the 5080 to the 5090 is a literal doubling of cuda cores, doubling of vram, and doubling of bus width. The gap there is absolutely massive. \n\nThe 5080 gets beat by the 5070ti in value once you do the math, and it gets crushed on performance by the 5090.",

      "I don’t get all the doom and gloom comments here….\n\n1. This isn’t some ploy to sell more cards. It doesn’t matter if the reviews dropped today, launch day, or if no review cards went out at all… every single card available on release will sell out pretty much instantly. Nvidia doesn’t need to resort to tricks to make that happen, it’s how pretty much every GPU launch in the last 20 years has gone. By the time steady stock is readily available, everyone will have had all the time they need to watch every review. \n\n2. There may be a gap of a few hours between when the embargo drops and when cards go live for sale. I seem to remember this happening with a few past GPU launches. \n\n3. You don’t have to buy the shit day one. If you think a 5080 may be the right card for you, but want time to thoroughly research it… take the time to thoroughly research it, and then buy it when you’ve made up your mind. People act like when new tech drops, they must have it day one. Why? If you’re worried, just don’t freaking buy it. \n\n4. Review embargo’s are absolutely necessary and a good thing. Without them, you’d have a lot of publications focused on being the first to publish. It incentivizes doing a poor job to scoop up views. Embargo’s level the field and ensure everyone has the same amount of time to publish a quality review. That in mind, separate dates for the two cards also makes sense. This ensures publications focus on the 5090 first (which Nvidia obviously wants), and then the 5080 after. A day sooner would have been nice, but given that it’s already a short gap, I have a feeling that’s an every day counts sort of situation."

    "selftext": "[Resolved]\n\nSo, I bought an MSI RTX 4090 Gaming X Trio about 2 years ago, brand new, from MSI's Official Amazon pgae. My GPU has been working and being used correctly, (high quality PSU, no overclocking, ect.) Then about 2 months ago I had a serious problem and my GPU would spin up my fans to the max while my monitors lost connection but I'd hear sound.\n\n Long story short, after spending hours of my time diagnosing the issue and trying to resolve it, it was for sure the GPU at fault, so I paid $120 to have it shipped all the way to Sacramento to get it fixed, including the power cable. I got it back about a month later and put it in my pc and had the same problem within hours after they sent it back to me, put it in my Wife's computer and same issue. \n\nI called customer service back and told them of the issue, got it sent out about 2 weeks ago, and just got an email stating that it was unrepairable and not replaceable. They offered me some money back,  but not much, and said it wasn't going to be the $1,750 I paid for it because their \"3 Year warranty\" isn't actually a warranty, it's only prorated.\n\nSo, now I'm completely lost on what to do. I don't have the money I did two years ago when I was able to buy this card, and I figured it would last at least until the warranty was up (I've have Nvida and AMD cards for numerous years, and never once had a hardware issue with any of them). So what should I do? I can't get another 4090 as they are over $2,000 on the used market right now, and can't get the only card in the world that's better than it (5090) for obvious reasons. Even the 5080 is far worse than the 4090 and I'd still have to pay extra just to get that downgrade If I was even able to find one. I'm sitting here numb, at a loss. Is there any wisdom or help you guys could provide? Thank you very much.\n\n[Edit] \n\n- I just filed a compaint aginst MSI on BBB and FTC (heard back from only the BBB)\n- I also contacted the MSI spokesperson and emailed them requiring a replacement or upgrade (see resolution)\n- I also emailed Gamers Nexus like you all said. (no reply)\n\n[Resolution]\n\nSo, after a good couple of days after I made this post, MSI finally resolved my issue (as much as you can expect them too). About a day after I filed multiple of those compaints, they responded with: \"The RMA is unable to repair your card which is why we are asking if you are okay with the refund.\nPlease kindly share me a copy of your initial component purchase and I will check with RMA Dept if able to process item price refund. Thanks.\" \n\nAfter that, I sent them my recipt they asked for and I specified that I'd much rather a replacement 4090, but if that was not able to be done (it has been out of production for a few months) then I'd accept a 5080 or 5090. They then waited some more time before responding. The next time they responded was in response to the BBB contacting them and asking for a resolution, in the resolution they stated they already offered a full refund that I did not accept (They offered me hundreds of dollars less than a \"Full Refund\"). I then see in an email from the MSI spokesperson that they are going to: \"We will refund you $1748.99 as we do not have an equivalent replacements to offer\". \n\nSo, with that being said, I'll take that offer of a full refund, as that is what I paid 2 years ago. I spoke to multiple people at different times who told me that they had ZERO 5080s or 5090s in stock. Since, this resolution is more expensive than sending me a 5080, I'm inclined to think they are at least out of 5080s. This isn't the resolution I wanted, but it's good enough, as I'm tired of this fighting which isn't face-to-face, just screen-to-screen. I'd rather just have a 4090 back, but it looks like I'll be buying something different now. Likely getting an RTX 5080 with that money, or an RX 7900 XTX. They have somewhat similar FPS in most games and the prices are less than what I paid for my RTX 4090. Thank you all for the help and wisdom!",

      "\"isn't actually a warranty\" is an outrageous statement given they explicitly list it as a warranty and the warranty length on their own store.\n\nYou live in the United States, they are legally required to make you whole. \n\nIn this case that means either a refund for the original purchase price or a functioning product of equal value.  It's common for MSI to play these games where they'll offer you a lower end product or less money that what you are entitled to.  If you accept those offers, you agree to taking less than you could have gotten.\n\nLet them know you are entitled to be made whole and may else wise be forced to take legal action.  Post this on other social media to put pressure on them to make it right.\n\nAll else fails, if your account of the story is correct, this is an extremely easily win in small claims court.  You will likely win by default given the cost to pay someone to travel and lodge in your state likely exceeds the value of the replacement.\n\nThe other comments in this thread telling you to just move on and buy a different card are capitulary.  All the big AIBs do this nonsense and just giving up encourages them to do this more.  Taking them to task will make them reconsider screwing their customers monetarily.",

      "Agreed, I'm not seeing anything that indicates it's prorated on their website: [https://us.msi.com/page/warranty](https://us.msi.com/page/warranty)\n\nThe first part of that page is crazy though:\n\n\"The warranty term differs from one region to another. If you would like to verify the warranty term of the product bought, please kindly contact our local offices.\"\n\nThey don't disclose said extra terms and they don't even provide a number to call (easy to implement a region selector that provides the correct number) or link to where the person could even further inquire about them.\n\nThe thing is, under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, companies are required to clearly and reasonably disclose these terms to customers.  They are impeding customers from learning about these said full terms in three ways:\n\n1. They don't disclose them online or at the place of sale.\n2. They require you to call in to learn full terms.\n3. They don't even provide the number for said full terms (at least not where one would reasonable expect it).\n\nIt's beyond shady that they are hiding warranty terms to such a degree.\n\nI will note though that Gigabyte's warrant IS prorated (but at least they provide the full terms FFS):  \"If a Product is near the end of a given warranty period and a repair/replacement is not possible, GIGABYTE reserves the right to offer an alternative of equal or greater value or a partial refund proportional to the remaining warranty life of the Product.\"\n\nI'm not sure when this trend started or if other companies are doing it but consumers should push back against it.  Prorated warranties make no sense for GPUs.  GPUs are not consumable products that quickly burn through their life in the mere 3 year warranty period.  Most of my GPUs last 10+ years.  GPUs are far too expensive and this is clearly a move to push customers to buy more often.  God i miss EVGA, screw these big corpa AIBs.",

      "Literally just murdered AMD’s 9070 before they even announce it lol.\n\nPeople over there were so fucking adamant that no way NVDA would sell the 5070 less than $650 and that the 9070 would undercut it by $50.",

      "Where are all the doomers saying that the 5080 was going to be at minimum 1500 dollars? Never believe rumored \"leak\" prices everyone. There's no such thing as a confirmed price until jensen walks on stage and says one",
      "Were any benchmarks shown without frame generation? Also it looks like DLSS4 features are coming to all RTX cards, just not multi-frame gen, which is the least exciting feature imo.",
      "Instead of fighting bots. You will be fighting 30+ year old men that smell like New York rats to get your 5090 at Microcenter.",
      "Very happy with the 5070 price point. Was expecting 650-700. Really excited to see reviews and upgrade out of my 2070 super. Pretty much only upgrading because of MH Wilds.",
      "From this imprecise bar graph, Nvidia seems to be saying that a 5090 gets framerates ~30 fps for native 4k path tracing in Cyberpunk, and ~150 fps with performance DLSS + DLSS3 frame generation.\n\nFor comparison, a 4090 gets ~20 fps with native 4k path tracing in Cyberpunk.\n\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-up-to-8x-faster-performance.jpg\n\nEDIT: Typo.",

      "What the actual fuck are these AI benchmarks?  \n  \nFP8 on 40 series but FP4 on 50 series? That's not even remotely a fair comparison. It's not even a comparison at all.",

Nor should any cards be affected that were produced more recently: “The production anomaly has been corrected,” he says****. In case you’re wondering, he also told us that* ***Nvidia was not aware of these issues before it launched these GPUs.***\n\n**Here's NVIDIA's Full Amended Statement**:\n\n>*We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement.

The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads.* ***Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement***. The production anomaly has been corrected.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Quick Clarification from me:**\n\nIn the response above, NVIDIA mentioned \"one fewer ROP\". In this case, they are referring to the Raster Operation partition. One (1) Raster Operation partition contains the eight (8) missing ROP units.\n\nAlso, if you want to check your 50 Series cards with [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/), below is the **correct** ROPs amounts from [Blackwell whitepaper](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf):\n\n* **RTX 5090** = 176 ROPs (Affected units have 168 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5080 =** 112 ROPs (Affected units have 104 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** = 96 ROPs (Affected units have 88 ROPs)\n\nWe have also seen [someone](https://reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1iwi18d/rtx_5080_missing_rops/) with 8 missing ROPs on his RTX 5080 as well. While the statement from NVIDIA did not mention RTX 5080, if you do have the same issue with any of the 50 Series cards, the path forward is the same and it is to **contact board manufacturers and** **RMA the card**",

      "Both 5090 and 5070 Ti are cut down dies. Given it doesn't affect the 5080, which is a full die, maybe something went wrong in the fusing off process to cut these defective dies down to spec.",
      "Buy a 50-series card for:\n\n\n- a rare chance of connector's melting.\n- a rare chance of capacitors blowing.\n- a rare chance of being underspecced.\n- a rare chance of having black screens.\n- an almost-certain chance of being overpriced.\n- a slightly-better performance than 40-series (relative to increased wattage-use).\n- incompatibility with the PhysX from Arkham Trilogy, Mirror's Edge, Borderlands etc.\n\n\nBest Generation Ever!",

      "This leak seems like Nvidia PR to try to hype people up after the disappointing specs leak a few weeks ago and change the narrative from how the 5080 will be so much slower than the 5090 to how it'll be faster than the last generation. \"Don't look at the 50% reduction. Look at this 10% improvement, instead.\"",
      "Sounds like a very good $800 card. I'm sure Nvidia will price it fairly.\n\nI'm sure.",
      "If it isn’t faster than the 4080 Super, it has no reason to exist. \n\nThe problem is that it seems like a fig leaf - it’s faster than the 4080 but not much (unless they add some DLSS magic). It’s gonna make more people want the 4090 and 5090, that’s its purpose.",
      "Yep it will be $800... times 2.",
      "I would be more impressed if it was called a 5070.",

      "Different generations of cuda cores offer different performance, so a 10% increase in cores could be a bigger jump than it looks on paper. \n\nI'm curious what could be coming in the way of 50 series locked features",
      "This is 5070ti 16 GB version larping as 5080 again   \n1 TB/s Bandwidth is nice finally for non XX90 series but its too late most realistically L3 cache bump like AMD GPUs  \nNvidia wants to market this 5070ti 16 GB from typical xx70 GPUs $500-600 to $700-999   \nNvidia definitely want to force market segment xx80 to $999 and above  \nLets not forget the original rumored 4080 specs again its that all over again",
      "Sounds like a very 5070ti. Nvidia still have time to undelay this one too",
      "The leaked specs actually suggest only a 5% increase in CUDA cores over the 4080 Super. The actual improvement should be more because of this faster memory and the generational improvement that you mention, but people may still be disappointed, especially if the 5090 is so much faster.",
      "People will always be disappointed solely because the 5090 exists. Even if the 5080 remains a very good card, the 5090 will always outperform it by such a stupid margin that you'll always remain disappointed. This is why I just like to think of the 5090 as the RTX TITAN, the enthusiast card, while I think of the 5080 as the highest tier commercial card. That helps with keeping my expectations in check.",
      "That will be the Super version a year down the line.",

      "$1000 would be my guess.\n\nBut only 1 model per AIB and FE will that price and instantly sold out then the other versions wil be $1200+"

    "selftext": "**Full Article Here**: [Link Here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-app-update-dlss-overrides-and-more/)\n\n**Article Summary below**\n\n* By installing the update and our new driver, launching at 6am PT, you can employ NVIDIA DLSS 4 to enhance over 75 games and apps with [DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/), and [new, even better AI models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/) for DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction.\n* GeForce RTX 50 Series gamers can now also enable **NVIDIA Smooth Motion**, a new driver-based AI model that delivers smoother gameplay by inferring an additional frame between two rendered frames. For games without DLSS Frame Generation, NVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new option for enhancing your experience on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.\n* A new [NVIDIA Broadcast](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/) update is now also available for download, introducing new AI-powered Studio Voice and Virtual Key Light effects to enhance your streams, and a new user interface that enables users to combine even more effects.\n* RTX Video Super Resolution enhances the quality of video using AI. Our new NVIDIA app update reduces the GPU usage of this popular feature by 30%, adds an on-screen status indicator, and enables users to automatically adapt quality and GPU utilization when using other GPU-intensive programs.\n* Rounding out our new release is the addition of more NVIDIA Control Panel options, namely Advanced Optimus and Multiple Display management.\n\n# NVIDIA DLSS 4 Overrides Upgrade Your Games & Apps\n\n* DLSS 4 also introduces the biggest upgrade to its AI models since the release of DLSS 2.0 in 2020.\n* DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA are now powered by the graphics industry’s first real-time application of ‘transformers’, the same advanced architecture powering frontier AI models like ChatGPT, Flux, and Gemini. DLSS transformer models improve image quality with improved temporal stability, less ghosting, and higher detail in motion.\n* Similarly, the DLSS Frame Generation AI model is upgraded, boosting performance and reducing VRAM use on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8s8rasqmz4ge1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=d083f85edb60d937ca63e6c006bf56dcf3e5b04d\n\n* *Alan Wake 2*, *Cyberpunk 2077*, and *Hogwarts Legacy* [have added native support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation today](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-out-now/).\n\nIn games and apps that have yet to update to DLSS 4 or add native support for DLSS Multi Frame Generation, NVIDIA app users can activate DLSS 4 overrides to enhance image quality on all GeForce RTX GPUs, unlock DLSS Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, and more:\n\n* **DLSS Multi Frame Generation Override** \\- Enables DLSS Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series users when Frame Generation is ON in-game\n* **DLSS Frame Generation Model Upgrade** \\- Enables the latest DLSS Frame Generation model for GeForce RTX 50 Series and GeForce RTX 40 Series users, when Frame Generation is ON in-game, which uses less video memory and can increase frame rates\n* **DLSS Transformer Model Upgrade -** Enables the latest transformer AI model for DLSS Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA for all GeForce RTX users, when the aforementioned features are ON in-game\n* **DLAA & Ultra Performance Modes** \\- Sets the internal rendering resolution for DLSS Super Resolution, enabling DLAA or Ultra Performance mode in games lacking native support, when Super Resolution is ON in-game\n\n*For a full list of games and apps with DLSS overrides, and a breakdown of which overrides are available in each title,* [*head here*](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps/)\n\nTo enable DLSS 4 overrides in NVIDIA app, press the “Refresh” button located within the 3 dot option:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wo3v4ez105ge1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0b2d72fca09872e1367b963d7c6bbf3c17c2ba6\n\nThen select a compatible game or app in Graphics > Program settings, and scroll down the list of options on the right to reach “Driver Settings”.\n\n**To enable DLSS Multi Frame Generation, which will boost frame rates significantly:**\n\n* Ensure DLSS Frame Generation is activated in the program, and then exit to the desktop\n* Select “DLSS Override - Frame Generation” in NVIDIA app\n* Pick 3X if you’re targeting up to 180 FPS, and 4X for 240 FPS or more\n* Reopen the program and enjoy even faster performance!\n* *Revert to the game’s natively integrated DLSS Frame Generation feature set by selecting “Use the 3D application setting”*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cmgw1sz305ge1.png?width=1817&format=png&auto=webp&s=32b720475b5679e8bf0c2dfefd2d45bc9f42b7b1\n\n**To upgrade DLSS Frame Generation to the new, more performant AI model:**\n\n* Ensure DLSS Frame Generation is activated in the program, and then exit to the desktop\n* Select “DLSS Override - Model Presets” in NVIDIA app\n* Select “Latest” under “Frame Generation”, then click “Apply”\n* Reopen the program\n* *Revert to the game’s natively integrated model by selecting “Use the 3D application setting”*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y3budvh705ge1.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=6be613ca0399292434c0ee9543ea0645b4fc876c\n\n**To upgrade DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, or DLAA to the new transformer AI model:**\n\n* Ensure the feature you wish to upgrade is activated in the program, and then exit to the desktop\n* Select “DLSS Override - Model Presets” in NVIDIA app\n* Select “Latest” under “Super Resolution” and “Ray Reconstruction”, then click “Apply”\n* As of January 30th, 2025, the “Latest” model for DLSS Super Resolution has been updated to Transformer \"Preset K\", a minor refinement to Transformer Preset J, which showcases improved temporal stability, reduced ghosting, and enhanced detail in motion. Let us know what you think!The “Latest” model for Ray Reconstruction continues to use Preset J\n* Revert to the game’s natively integrated models by selecting “Use the 3D application setting”\n* Reopen the program and experience enhanced image quality\n* *Apply an older or alternative DLSS Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) DLSS Super Resolution AI model by selecting one of the available presets in the dropdowns*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/116jj07a05ge1.png?width=1583&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b3aaf8488a8c063747005ea4ce9add1471e996\n\n**To enable DLAA or DLSS Ultra Performance mode in games without native support:**\n\n* Ensure DLSS Super Resolution is enabled in the program, and then exit to the desktop\n* Select “DLSS Override - Super Resolution” in NVIDIA app\n* Select the mode you wish to use, click “Apply”\n* Reopen the program\n* *Revert to the DLSS Super Resolution setting specified in the program by selecting “Use the 3D application setting”*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4u8yf1wc05ge1.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=c81e532af8045395ffbec06d315b401a06afa7ab\n\n# NVIDIA Broadcast Update Adds New AI Effects\n\nIn the Discover section of the NVIDIA app Home tab, or from [NVIDIA.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/), you can now download a new NVIDIA Broadcast update adding two new AI-powered beta effects.\n\nThe first, Studio Voice, enhances a user’s microphone sound quality. The other, Virtual Key Light, relights the subject to deliver even lighting, as if a physical key light was defining the form and dimension of the individual.\n\nBecause they harness demanding AI models, these new beta features are recommended for video conferencing or non-gaming livestreams using a GeForce RTX 5080 or 4080 GPU, or higher. NVIDIA is working to expand these features to more GeForce RTX GPUs in future updates.\n\nThe NVIDIA Broadcast upgrade also includes an updated user interface that allows users to apply more effects simultaneously, as well as improvements to the background noise removal, virtual background and eye contact effects.\n\n# RTX Video Super Resolution Now Supports HDR & Is More Efficient\n\nAccessed via System > Video in NVIDIA app, RTX Video uses AI to enhance streaming video on all GeForce RTX GPUs. It has 2 features: Video Super Resolution (VSR), which removes compression artifacts, and sharpens edges when upscaling. And Video HDR, which tone maps SDR videos to HDR.\n\nIn the new NVIDIA app update, VSR has been updated to a more efficient AI model, using up to 30% fewer GPU resources at its highest quality setting, allowing more GeForce RTX GPUs to enable it.\n\nVSR now also upscales HDR video, so if you are watching any HDR video below your monitor’s resolution in your browser, it will automatically get upscaled to your native panel resolution.\n\nWe’ve also added a GPU Utilization feature for RTX Video when Quality is set to “Auto”. Setting your GPU Utilization to “High” will use as much GPU as needed to provide the best quality Super Resolution available on your GPU.\n\nSetting the GPU Utilization to lower levels will reserve more GPU for games or creative apps by applying lower quality settings. Or alternatively, switch to Manual mode and set a fixed quality level to use at all times.\n\n# Advanced Optimus & Multiple Display Options\n\nThe NVIDIA app development team has converted, accelerated, and modernized two additional features from the NVIDIA Control Panel in this new release, with more on the way in the future.\n\nAdvanced Optimus enables a laptop to dynamically switch between using the GeForce GPU and integrated graphics. When performing basic tasks like word processing, the integrated processor is used. When GPU-accelerated apps or games are launched, Advanced Optimus switches to the GeForce GPU to maximize performance, to take advantage of high refresh rate displays, and to enable G-SYNC.\n\nNow, you can control Advanced Optimus in NVIDIA app from System > Displays. Open “Display Mode”, adjust as needed, then press Apply. With “NVIDIA GPU” selected, G-SYNC options and additional Display Settings appear, ready to be configured\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ky5qosi025ge1.png?width=2756&format=png&auto=webp&s=886ec3b0e7b9453a5720b23e7214c89963436ba6\n\nYou can determine if your laptop supports Advanced Optimus by going to System > My Rig, clicking “View Rig Details”, and scrolling down the list of items until you reach “Advanced Optimus”.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mje5ct1b25ge1.png?width=2904&format=png&auto=webp&s=485da6455dd5612ca33b421541587690d135d25b\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel’s “Set up multiple displays” enables you to move the virtual position of connected monitors and TVs, select the primary display, and clone displays across multiple devices. \n\nThese features can now be accessed from System > Displays in NVIDIA app:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ut70k3sc25ge1.png?width=2008&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d1447aa806f50e9f4584f3cce1327d82c105175\n\n# NVIDIA Smooth Motion Now Available\n\nNVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new driver-based AI model that delivers smoother gameplay by inferring an additional frame between two rendered frames. For games without DLSS Frame Generation, NVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new option for enhancing your experience on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.\n\nTo enable NVIDIA Smooth Motion, select a compatible DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 game in Graphics > Program settings. Scroll down the list of options on the right to reach “Driver Settings”, and switch Smooth Motion on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gztnvcvg25ge1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=f40ccdd2f981c58712ca5d421b12e67f4d9a64a1\n\nNVIDIA Smooth Motion can be applied to games running at native resolution, with super resolution technologies, or with other scaling techniques, typically doubling the perceived frame rate.\n\n# Feedback\n\n*To send NVIDIA feedback about any feature of the new app, please click the exclamation point to the right of the NVIDIA Overlay button*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0e687ovj25ge1.png?width=345&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e6f79cf96a34bf5a7917f7a4c95c80ba4ca4432",

There is no guarantee your card will even be able to OC, when the 2080 Ti's came out I went through 3 cards , the first two were fucked and had to be returned and the third was stable but could only OC 30 mhz, that was it. That was all she had in her. Same case with one of the first two.\n\nYou cant go into buying a card expecting a certain level of OC performance. In my opinion the 5080 will be a very solid gaming card but the 4090 will reign supreme as the 2nd best card for the foreseeable future. Being stronger and having 8GB more of VRAM is just too good. Some folks need that VRAM for AI model/productivity work or games with large texture sizes/mods. If the 5090 supply is as restricted as they say, we may very well see 4090 values rise to $2000 on eBay. they are already at $1850.",

      "If it's 10-15% slower than the 4090 and the 5090 is 30% faster than a 4090, doesn't that mean this is effectively something around 55% the speed of a 5090?\n\nI remember seeing the downvote brigade here disagree with the idea that 5080 is roughly half the power of a 5090. If the leak is true it doesn't seem far off... given half the cores, half the bandwidth, half of...everything more or less.\n\nNote: i'm extrapolating for gaming performance, not time spy performance. Time spy shows different numbers than typical gaming fps outcomes. Note that 3dmark puts the 7900xtx ahead of the 4080 super but in the real world it is usually behind even the 4080FE in gaming."

      "I know that 5090 is the first. But what is the second?\n\nEdited : sorry im dumb. 4090 is the second. Thats why people complaining not because the performance but the generational leap between 40 and 50 series when jensen bragging that 5070 = 4090 and we expecting that 5080 will be better than 4090",

      "It’s a very good card. I think it’s biggest downside is that it has 16GB of vram. It really should have more at this price point and to be future proof. This was almost certainly by design though so people wanting to do AI don’t buy them all up and gamers have a chance, so maybe it’s a blessing in disguise. NVIDIA will be in a tough spot with vram in the future, because as shown by the 5090 if they increase it further people doing AI will buy them all. I guess the way to solve this is cheaper pro series cards.",

      ">If you already have a high-end GeForce RTX 40 Series card, then there is no reason to upgrade. You're just missing out on multi-frame-generation, the DLSS Transformer model is supported on all older RTX cards, too. On the other hand, if you're coming from GeForce 30, then suddenly you'll get to experience frame generation, which will make a huge difference for your gaming experience\n\nOverall this sums it up best - No reason for current 40 series users to upgrade (specially the same price bracket).",
      "Now imagine how bad the the 5070 will be with its specs...\n\nI'm really wondering if it even beats the 4070 Super.\n\nSeems like a generation to skip unless you are going for a 5090.",
      "I wish every 40 gen owner would think the same so I could upgrade my 3070 easily. But it'll all be sold out for the coming weeks no doubt.",
      "thats one of the worst gen to gen gains that nvidia pulled.",
      "Unlike the 5080 and 5070ti the 5070 has **16% less cuda cores than the 4070 super** meaning there's a real chance it won't even beat the 4070 super, or at least trade blows with it. So at this price you're genuinely only paying for FG",
      "Not being double the speed of a 3080 means I’m not upgrading yet. It would be even less of an upgrade for me since the 3080Ti is closer to 3090 in raw performance.\n\nEdit: It’s possible the 5080ti or super gets there.  I’ll hold put and see what that’s like next year.",
      "If this was 24GB I would buy it. No way I'm spending 1200€ for a 16GB card, i would spend 700€ top for that.\n\nI'm skipping the 5000 series. Try harder next time, Jensen!",
      "Wow, didn't think it could be worse than releasing the RTX4080 at $1200, but this gen-over-gen performance uplift (for the xx80-class cards) lowered that bar even further. What a disappointment...\n\nOn the plus side, I now get to save $1000. xD",
      "The fact that this card is a downgrade from the 4090, two years later, is a real disappointment.  Without a significant increase to performance or VRAM, it needed a price cut.",

      "Pathetic, but on the other hand, it performs pretty well considering it's a 5070 in all but its name.\n\nTo make things even worse, people will still happily buy this, since, truth to be told, it's technically a significant upgrade from a 3080 in all metrics for instance and the best 999$ GPU on the market - well, assuming one can find it at MSRP or near that to begin with.\n\nIn fact, during writing this comment, I decided to make a one minute research, so let that sink: 3070 has more cores relative to 3090 (5888 vs 10496 -> 56%) than 5080 to 5090 (10752 vs 21760 -> 49%), the specs shrinkflation we're getting at this point is ridiculous, we might never 'escape Jensen'.\n\nBasically, they released the new '4080 12GB' but without the real 5080 this time, so people don't get mad again - thus nVIDIA learning from their mistake.\n\nThey did this specifically because they also saw people didn't like paying 1200$ for a '80' class card so instead they now sell a 5070 one renamed as 5080 for just 999$ which looks a lot more digestible.",
      "Yeah most likely. I am coming from a 2070 super so will be a good upgrade for me.",

As of 2025, the industry standard has transitioned to 12V-2X6, replacing the previous 12VHPWR standard. Our new cables incorporate significant advancements, including enhanced terminal and connector housing materials, along with thicker wires, to provide an additional safety buffer for the latest GPUs.\n\n>At MODDIY, all 12VHPWR / 12V-2X6 cables purchased from 2025 onward are manufactured in accordance with the new 12V-2X6 specifications and standards, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance with the RTX50 series GPUs.\n\n>Prior to 2024, the RTX50 series GPUs had not yet been introduced, and the prevailing standard was 12VHPWR. All cables produced before this period were designed and tested for use with the RTX40 series GPUs.\n\n>We recommend that all users upgrade to the new 12V-2X6 cables to take full advantage of the enhanced safety and performance features offered by this new standard.\n\n>You can buy the new 12V-2X6 cable at [ATX 3.1 PCIe 5.1 H++ 12V-2X6 675W 12VHPWR 16 Pin Power Cable](https://www.moddiy.com/products/ATX-3.1-PCIe-5.1-H%252b%252b-12V%252d2X6-675W-12VHPWR-16-Pin-Power-Cable.html).\n\n>**How can I identify if my cable is 12VHPWR or 12V-2X6?**\n\n>To determine the type of cable you have, consider the purchase date:\n\n>If the cable was purchased on or before 2024, it is a 12VHPWR.  \nIf the cable was purchased in 2025 or later, it is a 12V-2X6.\n\n>**Are there no changes in specifications between 12VHPWR and 12V-2X6?**\n\n>Yes, 12VHPWR and 12V-2X6 are fully compatible, and there is no change in cable specifications. However, this does not imply that the cable cannot be improved or enhanced.\n\n>It is a misconception that a product cannot be enhanced, or a new product cannot be released unless there is a change in specifications. This is clearly not the case.\n\n>In the PC industry, every product is continually improving and evolving. New products are introduced regularly, offering better features, superior performance, enhanced durability, improved materials, and more attractive designs, regardless of specification changes.\n\n# Falcon Northwest\n\n[Link to post here](https://x.com/falconnw/status/1889428378769564121?s=46)\n\n>HUGE respect for der8auer's testing, but we're not seeing anything like his setup's results.  \nWe tested ***many*** 5090 Founder's builds with multiple PSU & cable types undergoing days of closed chassis burn-in.  \nTemps (**images in F)** & amperages on all 12 wires are nominal.\n\nGPU Side = 165 °F = 73.89 °C\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bt13u7qm8pie1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=f811da34d31fae20ddbc143f8e9b650b01e88bd8\n\nPSU Side = 157 °F = 69.44 °C\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ulgszdq8pie1.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9b98a2dd4adff345f2440e32f73e25460a98802\n\nCurrent = 7.9A\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3j1n57kljpie1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a21aa050464bed5a9d7d84bd08b6cb703d0bd08\n\n# Jonny-Guru-Gerow (Corsair Head of R&D)\n\n^(Also a legendary PSU reviewer back in 2000s and 2010s)\n\n[Link to Reddit Account here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jonny-Guru-Gerow/)\n\nSome relevant comments:\n\n>It's a misunderstanding on MODDIY's end. Clearly they're not a member of the PCI-SIG and haven't read through the spec. Because the spec clearly states that the changes made that differentiate 12VHPWR from 12V-2x6 is made only on the connector on the GPU and the PSU (if applicable).\n\n>My best guess of this melted cable comes down to one of several QC issues. Bad crimp. Terminal not fully seated. That kind of thing. Derau8er already pointed out the issue with using mixed metals, but I didn't see any galvanic corrosion on the terminal. Doesn't mean it's not there. There's really zero tolerance with this connector, so even a little bit of GC could potentially cause enough resistance to cause failure. Who knows? I don't have the cable in my hands. :D\n\n\\------\n\n>The MODDIY was not thicker gauge than the Nvidia. They're both 16g. Just the MODDIY cable had a thicker insulation.\n\n\\------\n\n>That's wrong. Then again, that video is full of wrong (sadly. Not being like Steve and looking to beat up on people, but if the wire was moving 22A and was 130°C, it would have melted instantly.)\n\n>16g is the spec and the 12VHPWR connector only supports 16g wire. In fact, the reason why some mod shops sell 17g wire is because some people have problems putting paracord sleeve over a 16g wire and getting a good crimp. That extra mm going from16g to 17g is enough to allow the sleeve to fit better. But that's not spec. Paracord sleeves aren't spec. The spec is 16g wire. PERIOD.\n\n\\------\n\n>If it was that hot, he wouldn't be able to hold it in his hand. I don't know what his IR camera was measuring, but as Aris pointed out.... that wire would've melted. I've melted wires with a lot less current than that.\n\n>Also, the fact that the temperature at the PSU is hotter than the GPU is completely backwards from everything I've ever tested. And I've tested a lot. Right now I have a 5090 running Furmark 2 for an hour so far and I have 46.5°C at the PSU and 64.2°C at the GPU in a 30°C room. The card is using 575.7W on average.\n\n>Derau8er is smart. Hr'll figure things out sooner than later. I just think his video was too quick and dirty. Proper testing would be to move those connectors around the PSU interface. Unplug and replug and try again. Try another cable. At the very least, take all measurements at least twice. He's got everyone in an uproar and it's really all for nothing. Not saying there is no problem. I personally don't \\*like\\* the connector, but we don't have enough information right now and shouldn't be basing assumptions on some third party cable from some Hong Kong outfit.\n\n\\------\n\n>ABSOLUTELY. There is no argument that there is going to be different resistance across different pins. But no wire/terminal should get hotter than 105°C. We're CLEARLY seeing a problem where terminals are either not properly crimped, inserted, corroded, etc. what have you, and the power is going to a path of less resistance. But this is a design problem. I can't fix this. :-( (well... I can, maybe, but it requires overcomplicating the cable and breaking the spec)\n\n\\------\n\n>They provide this if your PSU is not capable of more than 150W per 8-pin. If used with a PSU that CAN provide more than 150W per 8-pin, it just splits the load up across the four connections\n\n>There is no \"6+2-pin to 12VHPWR\". The cable is a 2x4-pin Type 4 or 5 to 12V-2x6. There is no disadvantage to using this as the 12VHPWR has 6 12V conductors and 6 grounds and two sense that need to be grounded. 2x Type 4 connection gives you up to 8x 12V and 8x ground. So, this is a non-issue.\n\n>12VHPWR to 12VHPWR is fine too. Just like the 2x Type 4 8-pin or 2x Type 5 8-pin, you have a one-to-one connection between the PSU and the GPU. That' s why I don't like calling these cables \"adapters\". If it's one-to-one, it's not an adapter. It's just a \"cable\".\n\n\\------\n\n>The 8-pin PCIe is rated for 150W on the GPU side. The actual cable and connectors' rating is dependant on the materials used.\n\n>The 150W part came from the assumption that the worst case materials are used. Things like 20g wire. Phosphor bronze terminals. In most cases today, a single 8-pin (which is actually effectively only 6-pin since 2 of the pins are \"sense\" wires) can easily handle 300W each.\n\n\\------\n\n>So, as an update... I intentionally damaged a terminal (shoved a screwdriver in it and twisted), am getting < 1A on it and the others are over 10A. Not 20A, though. Which, if der8auers numbers are accurate, means the cable has MULTIPLE faults. Which may actually be the case. But I think he would have noticed that and called that out. \\*shrug\\* I hope he posts an update. He's more than welcome to reach out to me for a unlimited supply of cables. :D\n\n# Wendell - Level1Techs\n\n[Link to post here](https://x.com/tekwendell/status/1889431981425041691)\n\n>I've been testing with the FE 5090 w/ 550w+  in and out of the tiki and haven't had anything alarming for cable heating yet fwiw.

If something goes wrong, then at most it is the cable and connector. Two plugs, four results? It’s not quite that extreme, but another cable change shows: The values change slightly each time they are plugged in, which indicates the general deficiencies of the plug connection (clamping surface, contact). Added to this is the voltage drop, which also depends on chance.\n\n>The shortcomings of the 12VHPWR connector, in particular the uneven current distribution through the cable and connector, can cause unbalanced loads where individual pins are loaded more than others. These local overloads lead to increased contact resistance and heat generation, which under certain conditions can cause thermal damage to contacts and cables. In addition, by dispensing with active balancing and splitting the power supply across several rails in the board topology, NVIDIA has itself abandoned possible protective and corrective measures. As the cards directly take over the faulty distribution of the input side, the power load remains uncontrolled, which can lead to escalation under the wrong conditions.\n\n>This situation shows how several factors can interact: The inadequate plug connection as a starting point, the resulting thermal issues as a potential symptom, and the lack of protection measures on the board as an untapped opportunity to remedy the situation. Although such problems do not necessarily have to occur, the system remains susceptible to this concatenation if the load and the external conditions coincide unfavorably\n\n>The symptoms of melting contacts and overheated cables in modern GPUs can be explained as a chain of unfortunate circumstances that do not necessarily have to occur. On the contrary, it will probably remain the exception. But it can happen\n\n# OC3D\n\nVideo - [Link Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3BXarPl1F0)\n\nArticle - [Link Here](https://overclock3d.net/reviews/gpu_displays/asus-saved-our-bacon-we-had-12vhpwr-12v-2x6-cable-issues/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qtucj5qyyie1.png?width=3598&format=png&auto=webp&s=a06d4dabbd26e0e02ac4e21b8310de7d99a53f6e\n\n>While testing ASUS’ ROG Astral RTX 5090 LC GPU, we uncovered a startling problem. **Despite correctly/fully inserting our 16-pin GPU power cable, several of our GPU’s voltage pins had red indicators. Power was being unevenly pulled through our power connectors**.\n\n>**After repeatedly reseating our cables, we found that at least one light remained red**. While **we could get all lights to be green with careful manipulation, we clearly had a problem**. More shockingly, this problem would not have been noticed without ASUS’ “Power Detector” feature. Had we not been reviewing this specific graphics card, this problem would never have been noticed.\n\n>**All lights were green when we switched to a new 12V-2×6 power cable. Only our hard-used 16-pin power cables had issues. This implies that general wear and tear could make the difference between a safe and a dangerous power cable**. However, we must note that we have been using the same 16-pin power cables for years of GPU testing, making our cables incredibly well-worn.\n\n>**Today, we learned that worn/used 16-pin GPU power cables can have uneven power distribution across the cable**. Potentially, this can lead to dangerous amounts of power going through specific voltage pins. **To be frank, the OC3D GPU test system was on the road to disaster. Our cables were used to test a huge number of graphics cards, and that wear adds up. While we don’t expect many other PC builders to use/abuse their 16-pin cables as much as we do, cable wear is a factor that PC builders must consider. The safety margins of the 12V-2×6/12VHPWR standard are too low for us to simply ignore this issue.**\n\n>From now on, 16-pin GPU power cables will be considered by us as a consumable item. To help avoid issues, we will be replacing our cables regularly to help prevent catastrophic issues.\n\n>**For consumers, our recommendation is clear. When you buy a power-hungry GPU, consider buying a new 16-pin power cable.** **If you bought a new PSU with your GPU, you won’t need a new cable. However, if you plan to reuse your power supply, a new 12V-2×6 cable could save your bacon**. A lot of PSU manufacturers sell replacement 12V-2×6 cables, and many good 3rd party options are available (like those from **CableMod**).\n\n>With high-wattage GPUs costing £1,000+, purchasing a £20-30 cable is a worthy investment for those who want some extra peace of mind. It’s just a shame that such considerations are necessary.\n\n# Jayz2Cents\n\nVideo - [I inserted these cables over 100 times!

I simply can't trust the GPU, even after undervolting. There need to be around 2x safety margins… Period! I have usually said a lot of positive things for Nvidia, but now I hope the company gets sued big time.

it may therefore be disputed through other channels;\n\n>**Point 5:** It is true that no exclusions are indicated, and in fact in America even FE cards benefit from this code – in our region, NVIDIA does not provide this promotion because it does not sell products directly but through LDLC, which is a vendor like any other and does not participate in this promotion in Italy – this too is the response of those with expertise on the matter, and therefore cannot be contested via this channel;\n\n>**Point 6:** In Italy, LDLC is the only one selling Founders Editions, whereas in other countries the Founders Editions are sold by other companies; in Europe, it is not possible to purchase directly from the NVIDIA store and one must go through these resellers; in America, it is possible to purchase directly from the NVIDIA store – if you look on the LDLC website, you will not find Founders Editions listed, so the response from LDLC customer service stating “only for customers who placed an order on the LDLC France site” refers to custom cards, not Founders Editions.\n\n>That said, I understand why you insist, but I reiterate that this information/these responses are final as they come from the competent department.\n\n>Therefore, they cannot be contested through this communication channel, but you may dispute them through consumer protection agencies or other means.\n\n# Here's my answer:\n\n>Thank you for your response, but I cannot accept what you wrote as “definitive,” because it contains several statements contradicted by the official Terms and Conditions and by the information published on NVIDIA’s Italian website. Below I reply point by point:\n\n**01. The existence of the promo page does not prove that FE cards are included**\n\n>Correct: nowhere is it stated that FE cards are included.  \nBut it is also **nowhere stated that they are excluded**. The terms clearly state:\n\n>“Offer valid for desktop systems or NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, 5070 graphics cards…”\n\n>The Founders Edition **is** an RTX 5070. If there were any exclusions, they should have been listed. The absence of such an exclusion is meaningful.\n\n>Moreover, on the product page of the NVIDIA Marketplace, the RTX 5070 Founders Edition displayed the **“DOOM INCLUDED”** banner.\n\n**02. The T&Cs only mention the territory, not the inclusion of FE cards**\n\n>Exactly: they neither exclude nor mention FE cards, but **explicitly include Europe**.\n\n>The fact that the promotion is “valid in Europe at authorized partners and resellers” implies that purchases made in Europe from such partners (like LDLC) are eligible.\n\n**03. Not all partners participate, and LDLC is not listed at the bottom of the page**\n\n>But the page **does not exclude LDLC** — it simply does not mention it among the resellers in the United States and Canada (the list is clearly for the North American region).\n\n>Additionally:\n\n>My card was purchased through the **Italian NVIDIA Marketplace**, **not directly from LDLC’s website**.\n\n>The **“DOOM included”** banner was visible on the RTX 5070 product page at the time of purchase.\n\n>This is official promotional material, **not a mistake**.\n\n>\n\n>**04. The banner is present, but not related to EMEA**\n\n>This is a very serious statement:\n\n>The banner is on the **Italian NVIDIA Marketplace**, not the American one.\n\n>The website was **localized in Italian** and included the phrase “DOOM incluso”.\n\n>So NVIDIA **advertised the promotion in Italy, in the Italian language, on a site aimed at the Italian public**, and now claims that the promotion does not apply in this country.\n\n>This is, in effect, **misleading advertising**.\n\n>\n\n>**05. In the U.S. FE cards are included, in Europe they are not**\n\n>Once again:\n\n>If FE cards are excluded in Europe, this **must be stated in the T&Cs**.\n\n>If FE cards are excluded in Europe, they **should not have a banner** indicating they are part of the promotion.\n\n>There is **no clause** that limits the offer to “custom” cards.\n\n>Stating that the promotion applies in the U.S. but not in Europe, without this distinction being reflected in the official documents, **exposes NVIDIA to legal responsibility**.\n\n>\n\n>**06. FE cards in Europe are not sold directly by NVIDIA, so they are not valid**\n\n>But I did **not** purchase from LDLC.\n\n>I purchased from the **Italian NVIDIA website**.\n\n>And on that site, the **“DOOM included”** banner was present.\n\n>The fact that NVIDIA relies on LDLC for order fulfillment **does not change the nature of the offer made to the consumer**.\n\n>\n\n>**Conclusion**\n\n>The fact that you keep stating that the response is “not open to dispute” **does not make the claim correct**, nor does it negate the responsibilities that arise from misleading advertising. I will therefore proceed with a **report to AGCM** (the Italian Competition and Market Authority), and if necessary, to the **European Consumer Centre**.\n\n>I remain available in case NVIDIA decides to resolve this issue amicably.\n\n# And again, NVIDIA's response\n\n>\n\nI kindly ask you not to misuse this support service.\n\n>As I have already explained, this is not the appropriate channel to dispute this matter.\n\n>Therefore, I ask you not to proceed any further in this way, as your messages amount to venting dissatisfaction to people who are no longer in a position to help you – and that is not the purpose of my job.\n\n>The information I have provided to you is final, and there is no room to contest it through this channel.\n\n>Again, I ask you not to abuse the service being offered to you.\n\n>If you wish to confirm what I have told you, you may contact the channels I’ve already provided:\n\n>[info@nvidia.com](mailto:info@nvidia.com)\n\n>[https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/support/consumer/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/support/consumer/)\n\n>Thank you again for your understanding, and I hope you take into consideration what I have written.\n\n>This case is now considered closed.",

      "You do not have to buy a new card every generation.\n\n5080 is a fine upgrade from a 3080.\n\nIf you really really want to upgrade 4080, get a 5090. As a bonus, all your problems with too much money in your bank account are solved.",
      "Not really enough of a gap with the 40 series, despite the large core difference between the 4080 and the 4090 of 68% more, [the 4090 was only 20-25% faster or so in raster](https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-founders-edition/images/relative-performance_3840-2160.png). The only time you saw a bigger gap was with [RT enabled where it was more like 30-35% depending on the game for the 4090 in terms of a performance lead.](https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-founders-edition/images/relative-performance-rt-3840-2160.png)\n\nMuch of the prolem with the 4090 was that it was memory bottlenecked and the cores couldn't all be effectively used, I suspect this is also the case with the 5090 despite using GDDR7. Thats just a lot of cores and they need to be fed data quickly to be useful. Don't forget too, despite the memory bus being smaller on the 4080, it was probably more balanced or reached the sweet spot of memory efficiency, as in it had little bottlenecks in the computation pipeline. The 4080 and particularly the 4080 SUPER had faster G6X memory than the 4090 too. Had that faster G6X been given to the 4090 instead of the 4080, the gap would've been larger in favor of the 4090 since the cores could feed data in and out way faster.\n\nI think people are underestimating just how good the 5080 will be. Assuming the 5090 really is only about 25-30% faster than the 4090 considering the core count difference is around a 33% increase for the 5090 over the 4090 (of which architectures rarely scale linearly in terms of core count increase too) and the chart [NVIDIA has given us shows about a 27% performance increase in RT Far Cry 6](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwq919yvsolbe1.png%3Fwidth%3D960%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Ddbe652fc2d1e02ee2c74eff37251ab4b5bbad2f4). That means the 5090 is only about 50-55% faster than the 4080. That's not incredibly faster really, at least it's not like the jump in performance the 4090 gave over the 3090 and that was flagship vs last gen flagship, this is new gen flagship versus a whole tier lower from last gen. Kind of disappointing. Maybe the RT is holding the 5090's performance increase back and it's actually faster in pure raster, but I doubt it really, NVIDIA is probably showing best case scenarios of performance increase to really try and sell the GPU and as I said earlier the architectures rarely scale with core count increases, they tend to underperform.\n\nBut if we extrapolate the 5080 data, [we get 33% faster in Far Cry 6 RT for the 5080 over the 4080](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fd5thkxvsolbe1.png%3Fwidth%3D2644%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D79519f30f6366c139258a72feb316e32c98a9f01), assuming that maybe it's more like 20-30% because we should assume RT is a little faster than raster as probably thats where NVIDIA is getting big perf increases architecturally. So let's say it's 25% faster in raster, that puts us a little faster than the 4090, +/- 5-10%, probably more like 5%.\n\nThat leaves about a 20-25% performance gap between the 5090 and the 5080. Honestly, the 5080 is a no brainer at that point, half the price for around 80% the performance. There might not be room for a 5080 Ti in terms of performance, but there might be for VRAM.\n\nI mean just think about it, if they do make a 5080 Ti it would have to bring something to the table to justify the higher pricing, the gap in performance is kind of pointless for the price increase. With 40 series there really wasn't anything NVIDIA could give you to justify moving up, if you wanted more VRAM, paying $1599 for the 4090 versus the $1199 of the 4080 was kind of justified but only because the 4080 was priced so high to begin with. The pricing gap with 40 series just wasn't there to do a bigger VRAM card like a 4080 Ti and slot it in the product stack. If they did, what would it be? $1399? So they really couldn't do a 4080 Ti in the 40 series, not unless they bumped down the 4080 to $999 (which they did eventually with the 4080 SUPER but it took 14 months to do that) and tried to make a 4080 Ti at $1299 with 24GB of VRAM. But don't forget NVIDIA's original plan was to have a 4080 12GB and a 4080 16GB. The 4080 12GB was really a different die completely, which later became the rebranded 4070 Ti, neither of which were GB203. NVIDIA eventually also took all the \"bad\" AD102 dies and used them in China as the 4090D or as the RTX 5880 Ada, RTX 5000 Ada or L20's, some even ended up as 4070 Ti SUPERs (probably the absolute worst dies).\n\nSo the only justifiable reason for a 5080 Ti this gen is a VRAM increase and they could slot it in at $1499 with 24GB of VRAM becase to move a tier up in VRAM you have to spend double and buy a 5090. So I think that's what NVIDIA has done, they have priced the 5090 with a large enough gap to give themselves some room to slot in a 5080 Ti because last gen they really couldn't.",

      "This has seemed very likely to me the whole time.  If it were as strong as the 4090 it would trigger the Chinese import ban.  And nvidia is no longer in the business of selling +50% performance for the same price gen-over-gen. Incremental performance improvements that mostly track with price increases are way more typical.",
      "I know in the grand scheme the difference is minimal. But just on principle, the 5080 not matching the 4090 would be so annoying. Are gen on gen increases really that dead?

What that means is they're the same chips, just some are crippled and those become the lower tier offerings. Chip manufacturing is hard, these things are extraordinarily complex, delicate machines and you have to get everything literally perfect. It's just a fact of the business that a lot, if not most, chips you make come out defective. Maybe some cores don't work, maybe it's unstable at full frequency or wattage. Good news is, if you just disable the defective parts or don't run them as hard then it works and is stable.\n\nSo GPU markers don't throw out their defective chips if they can salvage them. Instead they sort them into bins of performance. So you have your flagship tier, the fully functional chip. Then below that you come up with a performance level that slightly defective chips can still meet. So if a chip isn't good enough to be a 5090 you call it a 5080. But some 5080s are more broken than others, so you just disable more cores, downclock, etc. to bring the more functional ones down to the same level as the weakest 5080. Then for chips too defective to be 5080s you have the 5070, and so on.\n\nWhat this means is that you can often eek out more performance with most chips. You can push the frequency back up to what the chip can actually handle, sometimes you can even do things like re-enable disabled cores though that's only ever been the case on a handful of GPUs. But this all depends on how defective your chip was. If you're lucky, it's near the top of the bin and was just artificially crippled. If you're unlucky, everything was disabled and toned down for a valid reason.",

I will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links. This will be sorted alphabetically.\n\n# Written Articles\n\n# [Babeltechreviews](https://babeltechreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)\n\n>For the Blackwell RTX 50 series launch, NVIDIA strategically chose to introduce their flagship model first, launching the GeForce RTX 5090 ahead of other models to set a high benchmark in performance. Following this release, other models like the RTX 5080 and RTX 5070 are set to be launched, all of which we assume will also be impressive with DLSS 4 and their new design. The RTX 5090 remains the pinnacle in terms of raw power and capabilities and is in a class of its own, alongside its high price tag.\n\n>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition’s powerful performance make it an essential upgrade for enthusiasts and professionals aiming to push the limits of what’s possible in their digital environments. Purists will not enjoy DLSS 4 and will want a much larger raw performance jump, but for those that do the performance uplift will make you drop your jaw just like it did to ours. We remember titles like Hogwarts Legacy having performance issues at launch and with DLSS 4 enabled we saw incredibly high gains of 301.6 AI generated FPS performance difference over its raw power. Nothing can replace proper optimization but expanding the capabilities of a game to perform in such large amounts is amazing.\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk3fECI-fmw)\n\n>Going into this review, it was clear that there was some trepidation that the RTX 5090 wouldn't offer enough of a performance advantage over its predecessor when it comes to raw frame-rates, ie without the multi frame generation tech that Nvidia leaned heavily on in its pre-release marketing. These are justifiable concerns - after all, there's no die shrink to accompany this generation of processors, and pushing more power can only get you so far.\n\n>Thankfully - for those that want to justify upgrading to a $2000+ graphics card - the beefier design and faster GDDR7 memory do deliver sizeable gains over the outgoing 4090 flagship, measured at around 31 percent on average at 4K. The differentials are understandably smaller when you look at lower resolutions - just 17 percent at 1080p, though anyone considering the 5090 is probably unlikely to be rocking a 1080p display. Nvidia, Intel, AMD and Sony have all spoken about the slowing progress in terms of silicon price to performance, and we can see why all four companies are now [looking to machine learning](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-ps5-pro-tech-interview-with-mark-cerny-and-mike-fitzgerald) technologies to shore up generational advancements.\n\n>Speaking of which, DLSS 4's multi frame generation is an effective tool for pushing frame-rates - though arguably not *performance* to higher levels. On the RTX 5090, it's best used along similarly high-end 4K 144Hz+ monitors, so it's no surprise that Nvidia and its partners ensured that reviewers had access to 4K 240Hz screens for their testing. If you're lucky enough to be in that situation, you can use MFG to essentially max out your monitor's refresh rate, with a choice of 1x, 2x or 3x frame generation.\n\n>There's of course a trade-off in terms of latency, but it's smaller than you might think - and once you've already enabled frame generation, knocking it up an extra level has only a small impact on thos latency figures. For example, in [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077) with RT Overdrive (path tracing), we saw frame-rates go with 94.5fps with DLSS upscaling to 286fps when adding 4x multi frame generation, a \\~3x multiplier at the cost of \\~9ms of added latency (26ms vs 35ms). If you have a 4K 240Hz monitor, that might be a trade worth taking - and of course, you're more than free to ignore frame generation and knock back other settings instead to get performance to a level you're happy with.\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/review-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-reference-edition/)\n\n>The RTX 5090 features an advanced rendering engine that pushes past previous limits with the help of its  21,760 CUDA cores. This means smoother and faster gameplay with more realistic environments, creating an immersive experience. The RTX 50 series introduced a new generation of Ray tracing and Tensor cores. These aren’t just numbers on a spec sheet – they represent a leap in efficiency and power. Located close to the shader engine, these cores work tirelessly to deliver distinctive outputs. Even though Tensor cores can be tricky to measure, their impact is unmistakable, especially when paired with DLSS3.5 and new DLSS4 with MFG  technology that delivers impressive results. The GeForce RTX 5090 is not just an enthusiast-class card; it's a versatile powerhouse. Whether playing games at 2K (2560x1440) or better yet, game at 4K (3840x2160), it offers superlative performance at every resolution. This makes it an outstanding choice for gamers who seek both quality and speed, transporting them into new realms of interactive entertainment\n\n>Depending on the game title this value can greatly differ! However, on average you're looking at 25% maybe 30% more traditional rendering performance. The thing is though, NVIDIA has invested a lot of the transistor budget into AI, Deeplearning and Neural shading. We've presented the numbers with DLSS4 and when you enable frame generation mode at 4x, the performance is astounding. The reality is that we are reaching physical limits where traditional methods of increasing performance are becoming harder than ever. Chips would have to grow even larger, power consumption would skyrocket, and costs would soar. Imagine a future where every attempt to push technology further leads to larger, more power-hungry chips that become increasingly expensive. As we encounter these boundaries, think creatively and seek new solutions. Instead of following a path that leads to dead ends, this challenge invites us to innovate and discover groundbreaking ideas such as DLSS4 and MFG.\n\n>If you factor out pricing and energy consumption, it's gonna be hard to not be impressed with the GeForce RTX 5090. The card drips and oozes performance and it all packs into a two-slot form factor. On the traditional shader rasterizer part, it's still a good notch faster than RTX 4090, however, if you are savvy with technologies like DLSS4 offers, the sky is the limit. We do hope to see more backwards compatibility with DLSS 4 so that older games will get this new tech included as well. DLSS4 is not perfect though, yes butter smooth, but in Alan Wake 2 for example the scene rendered was fantastic but we; see birds flying over in the sky leaving a weird hale trail. The scene was otherwise very nice though.  The Blackwell GPU architecture of the 5090 demonstrates proficient performance. It boasts about 1.25 to sometimes 1.50 times the raw shader performance compared to its predecessor, along with enhanced Raytracing and Tensor core capabilities.\n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review)\n\n>NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090 is the fastest, most powerful, and feature-rich consumer GPU in the world as of today, period. There’s no other way to put it. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition card itself is also a refined piece of hardware. To design a card that offers significantly more performance than an RTX 4090, at much higher power levels, in a roughly 33% smaller form factor is no small feat of engineering. The card also looks great in our opinion. On its own, the GeForce RTX 5090 is currently unmatched in the consumer GPU market – nothing can touch it in terms of performance, with virtually any workload – AI, content creation, gaming, you name it.\n\n>It's not all sunshine and rainbows, though. In many cases, the GeForce RTX 5090 offered nearly double the performance of its predecessor (RTX 3090) when it debuted, at lower power, while using the exact same settings and workloads. If you compare the GeForce RTX 5090 to the RTX 4090 at like settings, however, the RTX 5090 is “only” about 25% - 40% faster and consumes more power. The RTX 5090’s $1,999 MSRP is also significantly higher than the 4090’s $1,599 price tag. Considering the Ada and [Blackwell GPUs](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-architecture-overview) at play here are manufactured on the same TSMC process node, NVIDIA was still able to move the needle considerably, but the GeForce RTX 5090 doesn’t represent the same kind of monumental leap the RTX 4090 did when it launched, if you disregard its new rendering technologies at least.\n\n>You can’t disregard those new capabilities, though. Neural Rendering, DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, the updated media engine, and all that additional memory and memory bandwidth all have to be taken into consideration. When playing a game that can leverage Blackwell’s new features, the GeForce RTX 5090 can indeed be more than twice as fast as [the RTX 4090](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-gpu-review).\n\n>The use of frame generation has spurred much discussion since its introduction, and we understand the concerns regarding input latency and potential visual artifacts that come from using frame-gen. But the fact remains, using AI and machine learning to boost game and graphics performance in the most effective and efficient way forward at this time. Moving to more advanced manufacturing process nodes doesn’t offer the kind of power, performance and area benefits it once did, so boosting performance must ultimately come mostly from architectural and feature updates. And everyone in the PC graphics game is turning to AI. We specifically asked about the importance of traditional rasterization moving forward and were told development is still happening, and it will remain necessary for “ground truth” rendering to train the models, but ultimately AI will be generating more and more frames in the future.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review-the-600-watt-powerhouse-in-gaming-and-lab-tests/)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5090 delivered impressive results in practical tests. The card achieved significantly higher frame rates in Full HD, WQHD and Ultra HD compared to the RTX 4090, especially with DLSS and ray tracing support enabled. The multi-frame generation enables consistent frame pacing and reduces noticeable latency, which is particularly beneficial in fast and dynamic gaming scenarios. The improvements in patch tracing and ray tracing ensure a more realistic representation of complex scenes. Games such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2 visibly benefit from the technological advances and show that the Blackwell architecture has the potential to smoothly display the most demanding graphic effects.\n\n>The image quality achieved by the Transformer models in DLSS 4 is another important aspect. Where previously a clear trade-off had to be made between performance and quality, DLSS 4 combines both in an impressive way. Most notably, the new Performance setting offers almost the same visual quality as previous Quality modes. This is achieved through advanced AI-powered models that capture both local details and global relationships to produce a near-native image representation. The smooth and detailed rendering at significantly higher frame rates shows that DLSS 4 is an essential part of the RTX 5090, further underlining its performance. There will be a detailed practical test on this from our monitor professional Fritz Hunter.\n\n>In my opinion, the GeForce RTX 5090 is an impressive graphics card that shows just how far GPU technology has come. The new features in particular, such as DLSS 4 and Transformer-supported image optimization, set new standards. The performance of this card is simply breathtaking, be it in games in Ultra HD with active patch tracing or in demanding AI-supported applications. It is remarkable how NVIDIA has managed to find the balance between graphical excellence and innovative technologies. Another outstanding aspect is the ability of DLSS 4 to achieve an image quality that is almost indistinguishable from native resolutions, while at the same time increasing performance. The change from “Quality” to “Performance” as a standard option is like a revolution in the way we perceive image enhancement. The smooth display, combined with an incredible level of detail, takes the gaming experience to a new level.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-ray-tracing-dlss-4-and-raw-power-explored/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wEXrZSnsRM)\n\n>Much was made of the performance ahead of launch, people were breaking out rulers and [pixel counting Nvidia's bar charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1hvvrqj/50_vs_40_series_nvidia_benchmark_exact_numbers/), but after thorough testing today we can confirm native rendering performance has increased in the ballpark of 30% over the RTX 4090 when testing at 4K. That makes the RTX 5090 64% faster on average compared to AMD's current consumer flagship, the RX 7900 XTX, while it's also a 71% uplift over the RTX 4080 Super. Ray tracing also scales similarly, given we saw the exact same 29% margin over the RTX 4090 in the eight RT titles we tested.\n\n>Those are the sort of performance increases you can expect at 4K, but the uplift does get progressively smaller as resolution decreases. Versus the RTX 4090, for instance, we saw smaller gains of 22% at 1440p and 18% at 1080p. Now, I don't expect many people will be gaming at native 1080p on an RTX 5090, but it's worth bearing that in mind if you'd typically game with DLSS Super Resolution. After all, using its performance mode at 4K utilises a 1080p internal render resolution. Clearly this is a card designed for 4K – and perhaps even above – but that performance scaling at lower resolutions could be something to bear in mind.\n\n>Of course, whether or not you are impressed by those generational gains depends entirely on your perspective – an extra 30% over the 4090 could sound great, or it could be a disappointment. The main thing from my perspective as a reviewer is to give you, the reader, as much information as possible to allow you to make an informed decision, and I think I have done that today.\n\n>Gamers do get the extra value add of DLSS 4, specifically Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is a new feature exclusive to the RTX 50-series. I spent a fair bit of time testing MFG as part of this review and I think if you already got on with Frame Generation on the RX 40-series, you'll probably find a lot to like with MFG. It's been particularly useful in enabling 4K/240Hz gaming experiences that wouldn't otherwise be possible – such as high frame rate path tracing in Cyberpunk 2077 – and with the growing [4K OLED monitor segment](https://www.kitguru.net/components/matthew-wilson/ces-2025-leo-gets-a-closer-look-at-new-msi-oled-monitors-dual-system-case-and-more/), that's certainly good news.\n\n>However, it's definitely not a perfect technology as the discerning gamer will still notice some fizzling or shimmering that isn't otherwise there, while latency scaling is still backwards compared to what we've come to expect – in the sense that latency actually *increases* as frame rate increases with MFG, rather than latency decreasing. That means some will find it problematic as the *feel* doesn't always match up to the visual fluidity of the increased frame rate.\n\n>It is great to see Nvidia is improving other aspects of DLSS, though, with its new Transformer-based models of Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. Not only do these improve things like ghosting and overall level of detail compared to the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, but this upgrade actually applies to *all* RTX GPUs, right the way back to the 20-series. There's even a possibility that Multi Frame Gen [might come to older cards](https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/joao-silva/nvidia-multi-frame-generation-could-come-to-rtx-30-series-gpus/) given that Nvidia hasn't explicitly ruled it out, but personally I'd be surprised to see that happen given it currently acts as an incentive to upgrade to the latest and greatest.\n\n>We can't end this review without a discussion of Nvidia's Founders Edition design, either. This is a *highly* impressive feat of engineering, considering it's a mere dual-slot thickness yet it is able to comfortably tame 575W of power. We saw the GPU settling at 72C during a thirty-minute 4K stress test, while the VRAM hit 88C, which is slightly warmer but still well within safe limits. I love to see the innovation in this department, as when pretty much every AIB partner is slapping quad-slot coolers onto their 5090s, this is a refreshing step back to a time when GPUs didn't cover the entire bottom-half of your motherboard.\n\n# [LanOC](https://lanoc.org/review/video-cards/9132-nvidia-rtx-5090-founders-edition)\n\n>Performance for the new generation of cards in my testing had the RTX 5090 outperforming the RTX 4090 by around 32% which is right in line with the increase in CUDA cores for the card. There were some tests which saw an even bigger increase and the RTX 5090 was at the top of the chart across the board in every applicable test. What was even more impressive to me was the improvements with DLSS 4, the performance difference that it can make is sometimes shocking, but on top of that Nvidia has improved the smoothness and picture quality. At the end of the day, there wasn’t anything that I threw at the RTX 5090 that slowed it down, but if you do run into something that it can’t handle DLSS 4 is going to fix you right up. I did see some bugs in my DLSS testing, mostly when trying down resolutions, but I suspect some of those will be smoothed out once the updates are released. The biggest issue I ran into performance-wise was that a few of our benchmarks just wouldn’t run at all and they were all OpenCL. Nvidia is aware and is working to get support for those tests.\n\n>The big increase in performance without any change in manufacturing size does have the RTX 5090 having a significantly higher power consumption. I saw it pulling up to 648 watts at peak, combine that with today's highest-end CPUs and we are swinging back to needing high-wattage power supplies. Speaking of power, the power connection has been improved in a whole list of ways including moving from the original 12VHPWR connection to the changed design that is called 12V-2-6. It looks the same and all of the power supplies will still connect. But they have changed the pin heights to get a better connection and the sense pins are shorter and are more likely to catch when the plug isn’t connected all the way. On top of that Nvidia’s card design has recessed the connection down into the card and angled it to reduce any strain on the connection. They have also included a much nicer power adapter as well. All of that power does mean there is more heat but the double blow-through design handled it surprisingly well running similarly in temperatures to the RTX 4090 Founders Edition even with a thinner card design and a lot more wattage going through.\n\n# [OC3D Article](https://overclock3d.net/reviews/gpu_displays/nvidia-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oDxME5APa8)\n\n>Speaking of DLSS 4, that comes with the big ticket item in the Blackwell release, Multi Frame Generation. By refining the algorithm, and giving the card newer generations of hardware, the RTX 5090 can now generate three extra frames from a single frame rendered. As you could see from our results in Alan Wake II, Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, the effect is considerable. Cyberpunk 2077, with an open world, neon soaked, usually wet and thus reflective environment is about as good as games can look. Turn on path-tracing and it’s nearly real life. That path-tracing has a massive performance cost though. On the RTX 4090 you get 133 FPS @ 4K without it, 40 FPS with it.\n\n>Even turning DLSS and Frame Gen on doesn’t recoup all that, maxing out at 104. Click through the Multi Frame Gen settings on the RTX 5090 though and that number hits 241 FPS. With, and we cannot state this enough, NO loss in visual fidelity. That’s Cyberpunk at 4K with pathed ray-tracing turned on and a frame rate you’d require a very expensive monitor (4K@240Hz!) to appreciate fully. When CD Projekt Red’s Magnum Opus first appeared you could get smoother frame rates from a flipbook.\n\n>All of which returns us to the way we’ve tested how we have. Because in regular mode, with DLSS turned on and, at most, a single frame generated as is currently the way, the RTX 5090 is another big step forwards on the best of the current cards. Anything which can stomp on a RTX 4090 is crazy good. That the RTX 5090 Founders Edition can do that, and then has much further to go with the benefits of MFG, makes any claims about it being a purely software-based improvement look as ill-informed as they do.\n\n>Already that’s more than enough to make the Nvidia RTX 5090 Founders Edition a Day One recommendation to anyone serious about their gaming. We haven’t even mentioned the crazy low latencies – and thus higher KD ratio – of the upgraded Reflex 2 technology. Or RTX Neural Faces that can convert a 2D picture into a 3D character. We’ve not discussed, because it’s embryonic, the potential of the AI powered NPCs with the Nvidia Ace technology. Or the extra broadcast features, faster encoding and decoding, and all the AI calculation benefits having this much power at your disposal can bring.\n\n>Simply put, the Nvidia RTX 5090 has coalesced all the current thinking on AI, performance, sharpness, and generative content into a single card that blows the doors off anything on the market. It’s the future, today.\n\n# [PC Perspective](https://pcper.com/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)\n\n>Well, NVIDIA has topped NVIDIA. Once again, and with zero competition at the high end, GeForce reigns supreme. And while raster performance has risen, DLSS 4 is the star of the show with the RTX 50 Series, now supporting up to ***four*** generated frames per rendered frame (!) if you dare. Yes, the price for NVIDIA’s flagship has risen again, from $1599 to $1999 this generation, but those who want the fastest graphics card in the world will surely buy it anyway.\n\n# [PC World Article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J5wDq2ba2E)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 4090 stood unopposed as the ultimate gaming GPU since the moment it launched. No longer. The new Blackwell generation uses the same underlying TSMC 4N process technology as the RTX 40-series, so Nvidia couldn’t squeeze easy improvements there. Instead, the company overhauled the RTX 5090’s instruction pipeline, endowed it with 33 percent more CUDA cores, and pushed it to a staggering 575W TGP, up from the 4090’s 450W. Blackwell also introduced a new generation of RT and AI cores.\n\n>Add it all up and the RTX 5090 is an unparalleled gaming beast — though the effects hit different depending on whether or not you’re using RTX features like ray tracing and DLSS.\n\n>In games that *don’t* use ray tracing or DLSS, simply brute force graphics rendering, the RTX 5090 isn’t much more than a mild generational performance upgrade. It runs an average of 27 percent faster in those games — but the splits swing wildly depending on the game: *Cyberpunk 2077* is 50 percent faster, *Shadow of the Tomb Raider* is 32 percent faster, and *Rainbox Six Siege* is 28 percent faster, but *Assassin’s Creed Valhalla* and *Call of Duty: Black Ops 6* only pick up 15 and 12 percent more performance, respectively.\n\n>Much like DLSS, DLSS 2, and DLSS 3 before it, the [new DLSS 4 generation](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&xs=1&url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/&xcust=2-1-2585806-1-0-0-0-0&sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html) is an absolute game-changer. Nvidia’s boundary-pushing AI tech continues to look better, run faster, and now *feel* smoother. It’s insane.\n\n>Nvidia made two monumental changes to DLSS to coincide with the RTX 50-series release. First, all DLSS games will be switching to a new “Transformer” model from the older “Convolutional Neural Network” behind the scenes, on all RTX GPUs going back to the 20-series.\n\n>More crucially for the RTX 5090 (and future 50-series offerings), DLSS 4 adds a new Multi Frame Generation technology, building upon the success of [DLSS 3 Frame Gen](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html). While DLSS 3 uses tensor cores to insert a single AI-generated frame between GPU-rendered frames, supercharging performance, MFG inserts *three* AI frames between each GPU-rendered frame (which itself may only be rendering an image at quarter resolution, then using DLSS Super Resolution to upscale that to fit your screen).\n\n>Bottom line: DLSS 4 is a stunning upgrade you *must* play around with to fully appreciate its benefits. It’s literally a game-changer, once again — though we’ll have to see if it feels *this* sublime on lower-end Nvidia cards like the more affordable RTX 5070.\n\n>In a vacuum, the RTX 5090 delivers around a 30 percent average boost in gaming performance over the RTX 4090. That’s a solid generational improvement, but one we’ve seen throughout history delivered at the same price point as the older, slower outgoing hardware. Nvidia asking for an extra $500 on top seems garish and overblown from that perspective.\n\n>While I wouldn’t recommend upgrading to this over the RTX 4090 for gaming (unless you’re giddy to try DLSS 4), it’s a definite upgrade option for the RTX 3090 and anything older. The 4090 was 55 to 83 percent faster than the 3090 in games, and the 5090 is about 30 percent faster than *that*, with gobs more memory.\n\n>At the end of the day, nobody needs a $2,000 graphics card to play games. But if you *want* one and don’t mind the sticker price, this is easily the most powerful, capable graphics card ever released. The GeForce RTX 5090 is a performance monster supercharged by DLSS 4’s see-it-to-believe it magic.\n\n# [Puget Systems (Content Creation Review)](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-content-creation-review/)\n\n>Overall, the RTX 5090 is a beast of a card. Drawing 575 W, with 32 GB VRAM and a $2000 price tag (at least), it is overkill for many use cases. However, it excels at GPU-heavy workloads like rendering and provides solid performance improvements over the last-gen 4090 in many applications. There are some issues with software compatibility that need to be worked out, but historically, NVIDIA has been great about ensuring its products are properly supported throughout the software ecosystem.\n\n>For **video editing and motion graphics**, the RTX 5090 performs well, with 10-20% improvements across the board. In particular sub-tests, where the workload is primarily GPU bound, we see up to 35% performance advantages over the previous-generation 4090. However, the area we are most excited about is actually the enhanced codec support for the NVENC/NVDEC engines. In DaVinci Resolve, the H.265 4:2:2 10-bit processing was more than twice as fast as software decoding and exceeded even what we see from Intel Quick Sync. Even if the 5090 is more than a workload requires, we are excited to see what this means for upcoming 50-series cards.\n\n>In **rendering applications**, real-time and offline, the 5090 pushes its lead over previous-generation cards even further. It is 17% faster than the 4090 in our Unreal Engine benchmark while also offering more VRAM for heavy scenes. Offline renderers, such as V-Ray and Blender, score 38% and 35% higher than 4090, respectively. This more than justifies the $2,000 MSRP, especially factoring in the added VRAM. The lack of support for some of our normally-tested rendering engines is non-ideal, but we are hopeful NVIDIA will address that issue shortly.\n\n>NVIDIA’s new GeForce RTX 5090 is a monster of a GPU, delivering best-in-class performance alongside a rich feature set. However, it comes along with a huge price tag of $2,000 MSRP; ad likely higher for most buyers, as AIB cards will be a good bit more expensive than that. It also requires that your computer can support that much power draw and heat. If you need the most powerful consumer GPU ever made, this is it. Otherwise, we are excited by what this promises for the rest of the 50-series of GPUs and look forward to testing those in the near future.\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition/)\n\n>At 4K resolution, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 35% performance uplift over the RTX 4090. While this is certainly impressive, it is considerably less than what we got from RTX 3090 Ti to RTX 4090 (+51%). NVIDIA still achieves their \"twice the performance every second generation\" rule: the RTX 5090 is twice as fast as the RTX 3090 Ti. There really isn't much on the market that RTX 5090 can be compared to, it's 75% faster than AMD's flagship the RX 7900 XTX. AMD has confirmed that they are not going for high-end with RDNA 4, and it's expected that the RX 9070 Series will end up somewhere between RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 GRE. This means that RTX 5090 is at least twice as fast as AMD's fastest next-generation card. Compared to the second-fastest Ada card, the RTX 4080 Super, the performance increase is 72%--wow!\n\n>There really is no question, RTX 5090 is the card you want for 4K gaming at maximum settings with all RT eye candy enabled. I guess you could run the card at 1440p at insanely high FPS, but considering that DLSS 4 will give you those FPS even at 4K, the only reason why you would want to do that is if you really want the lowest latency with the highest FPS.\n\n>Want lower latency? Then turn on DLSS 4 Upscaling, which lowers the render resolution and scales up the native frame. In the past there were a lot of debates where DLSS upscaling image quality is good enough, some people even claimed \"better than native\"--I strongly disagree with that--I'm one of the people who are allergic to DLSS 3 upscaling, even at \"quality.\" With Blackwell, NVIDIA is introducing a \"Transformers\" upscaling model for DLSS, which is a major improvement over the previous \"CNN\" model. I tested Transformers and I'm in love. The image quality is so good, \"Quality\" looks like native, sometimes better. There is no more flickering or low-res smeared out textures on the horizon. Thin wires are crystal clear, even at sub-4K resolution! You really have to see it for yourself to appreciate it, it's almost like magic. The best thing? DLSS Transformers is available not only on GeForce 50, but on all GeForce RTX cards with Tensor Cores! While it comes with a roughly 10% performance hit compared to CNN, I would never go back to CNN. While our press driver was limited to a handful of games with DLSS 4 support, NVIDIA will have around 75 games supporting it on launch, most through NVIDIA App overrides, and many more are individually tested, to ensure best results. NVIDIA is putting extra focus on ensuring that there will be no anti-cheat drama when using the overrides.\n\n# [The FPS Review](https://www.thefpsreview.com/2025/01/23/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-video-card-review/)\n\n>There is a lot to unpack in regards to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, and GeForce RTX 50 series from NVIDIA. A lot of technologies have been debuted, and there are a lot of features to test that we simply cannot do in one single review. In today’s review, we focused on the gameplay performance aspect of the GeForce RTX 5090.\n\n>We focused on the GeForce RTX 5090 performance, so subsequent reviews will focus on the rest of the family, and we’ll have to see how they fit into the overall opinion of the RTX 50 series family this generation. For now, we can look at the GeForce RTX 5090 as the flagship of the RTX 50 series, and what it offers for the gameplay experience at a steep price of $1,999, a 25% price bump over the previous generation GeForce RTX 4090.\n\n>If we look back at the average performance gains we saw in just regular raster performance, we experienced performance that ranged from 19%-48%, but there were a lot of common performance gains in the 30-33% range. We did have some outliers that were lower, and some higher, depending on the game and settings. We generally saw gains in the 30% region with Ray Tracing enabled, where scenarios were more GPU-bound.\n\n>We think one problem that is being encountered is that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 is becoming CPU-bound in a lot of games. The data tells us that perhaps even our AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is holding back the potential of the GeForce RTX 5090. Therefore, as newer, faster CPU generations are released, the GeForce RTX 5090’s performance advantage may increase over time. The GeForce RTX 5090 has powerful specifications, but the performance advantage we are currently seeing seems shy of what should be expected with those specifications. It may very well be the case that it is being held back, and it has more potential with better-optimized games or faster CPUs. Time will tell on that one.\n\n>As it stands right now, you should always buy based on the current level of performance, not what might happen. Therefore, at this time you are seeing about a 33% gameplay performance advantage average, but with a 25% price increase, making the price-to-performance value very narrow. The facts are, that the GeForce RTX 5090 has no competition, it does offer the best gameplay performance you can get on the desktop.\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review)\n\n>The RTX 5090 is a lot like this initial review: It's a bit of a messy situation — a work in progress. We're not done testing, and Nvidia isn't done either. Certain games and apps need updates and/or driver work. Nvidia usually does pretty good with drivers, but new architectures can change requirements in somewhat unexpected ways, and Nvidia needs to continue to work on tuning and optimizing its drivers. We're also sure Nvidia doesn't need us to tell it that.\n\n>Gaming performance is very much about running 4K and maxed out settings. If you only have a 1440p or 1080p display, you're better off saving your pennies and upgrading you monitor — and probably the rest of your PC as well! — before spending a couple grand on a gaming GPU.\n\n>Unless you're also interested in non-gaming applications and tasks, particularly AI workloads. If that's what you're after, the RTX 5090 could be a perfect fit.\n\n>The RTX 5090 is the sort of GPU that every gamer would love to have, but few can actually afford. If we're right and the AI industry starts picking up 5090 cards, prices could end up being even higher.

We get it, you want the best at all times but now that you don't want to dish out the money for a smaller relative upgrade you want to shit on a product that would be a much bigger upgrade for everyone else that doesn't look to upgrade every generation.",

      "I just can't see it being over $1200. It just won't sell, especially if you then have to add tariffs on top of that. The 4080 did poorly, and they later released a better card for far less money (better card at same price would be normal, albeit not so much nowadays lol). I feel like the smart bet for Nvidia would be to launch the 5080 at $999 IMO. It's still more than it should be but will probably sell off the shelves at a reasonable rate. Maybe they can get away with $1200+, but if it didn't work at all last time, I don't see why it would this time, especially since it didn't jump in VRAM or anything in terms of it being a better long term investment, and there are a lot of other issues going on in the world ATM. Maybe i'm completely wrong and it will be $1400-1500+ as people are speculating, I just think that's a waste of everyones time for them to launch it at that lol. \n\nMy best (uneducated, but also not hugely influence by a ton of nonsense leaks) guess is it will just be a \"same price as 4080 for a new card!!!\" marketing situation, priced at $1200, and even though that's terrible a lot of people will eat it up and thank them for it, and it will sell a bit better than the 4080 did. But nobody knows, time will see. Hoping for $999, as everyone should be, though.",

      "Yet I have no stuttering at all man. It's buttery smooth and very high framerate. I did see a post regarding issues with recording power usage in MSI Afterburner causing stutters on 9800x3d. I preemptively turned those values off and have had no issues. I also used the X3D mode by mistake at first in my MSI BIOS but turned it back off. Cyberpunk actually ran slightly better with it on, but everything loaded slower due to it disabling SMT. \n\nBeyond that I have no idea what could be causing it for you man. I didn't do a reinstall of windows either, just installed the AMD chipset and other relevant drivers and uninstalled the Intel stuff.",
      "I think the 12600k is severely gimped by the ddr4 ram. Also if you run DLSS Performance the rended resolution before the upscaling is quite low at your resolution, so it's more CPU bound. In fact in Warframe you use dlss quality and have similar results, if the 12600k had drr5 it would be even closer.",
      "I just upgraded my 12600K to a 9800X3D and it's awesome man. I commented on yours specifically bc my roommate is on a 10700K and wants to upgrade too. He plans to upgrade soon and is also excited! It's gonna be so good once you do haha.",
      "Gonna have to offer a counterpoint here. I also upgraded from a 10700k and I honestly hate my 9800X3D. Many games that were smooth on my older, much weaker Intel system are now stuttering on my 9800X3D. Tried for months to troubleshoot, change parts, reinstall Windows, everything, nothing changed. You can go over on /r/AMDHelp and [see for yourself](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/search?q=9800X3D+stutter&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all), this is a widespread issue with this CPU.\n\nI'm past the return window now but I'm going to get rid of this chip personally. Having much higher framerate doesn't mean anything with your frametime consistency is that bad.",
      "This is 1080p, 1080p cpu benchmarks are great to actually see a difference between CPUs but the gap gets way smaller by increasing the resolution, you hardly get any bottleneck at 1440p + if you have at least a 5600X.\n\nAnd with X3D cache that's even harder to bottleneck\n\nOP is showing the difference between the 12600K and 9800X3D at 3440x1440, and obviously the 9800X3D will win against the 5700X3D, not saying it doesn't\n\nBut at 3440x1440 the gap between the 5700X3D and the 9800X3D is way smaller than between the 12600K and 9800X3D\n\nThe chart you're sharing doesn't even have the 12600K, that's how far down it is\n\nHence why i said that u/kevinzeroone 's 5700X3D is fine\n\nI assume that if someone have a GPU big enough to worry about bottleneck, they're at least using 1440p",
      "3080ti here... Never thought about upgrading just the CPU (i7-12700kf )since this GPU launch is a disaster \nNow I'm tempted",
      "I think you forgot to mention the resolution, but that's a great improvement, i know some games will run better on a 9800x3D, i bought it back on december, and although i had a 14700kf and despite of the multiple comments of people telling me that i would not perceive an improvement, i actually got the benefits of changing it, most of the competitive games that i play got boosted by 20-30% at 3440x1440.",
      "Ram made a *huge* difference with my 12th gen i9/4070 Ti…Upgrading ram/mobo from 3200mhz DDR4 to 6000mhz DDR5 not only gave me a solid 20-30% fps boost (at 3440x1440) but *muuuch* more stable frame times. Will be moving the 12900k to a workstation soon and throwing a 14700k in this machine, I’m pretty stoked.",
      "I mean if you would've had DDR5 ram on 12600K too, I don't think the difference would be that much.",
      "Ohhh, so you used DLSS. Would be interesting to see in native, since that resolution is large enough to put way more weight on the GPU. But DLSS turns it around.",
      "This is 1080p with a 4090 which is completely irrelevant for sane people.",
      "So basically Alder Lake is still plenty for gaming, and now with Frame Gen it is virtually twice as powerful.",
      "These tests are not 4K, which i would assume the majority of people getting a 5080 would be playing at.",
      "I'm guessing that if this was an i9-14900k with a DDR5 then the charts would be slightly high on the blue if not equally leveled against the 9800x3D maybe 🤔 🤷‍♂️"

    "title": "[Megathread] NVIDIA Confirms 'rare' GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs manufacturing issue - Production anomaly has been corrected",
    "selftext": "**Full Article Here**: [https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte](https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte)\n\n**NVIDIA's Response Below**:\n\n>*“Upon further investigation, we’ve identified that an* ***early production build of GeForce RTX 5080 GPUs were also affected by the same issue***\\*.\\* ***Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement***\\*,” Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells The Verge.\\*\n\n>*In response to The Verge’s questions, Berraondo adds that “****no other Nvidia GPUs have been affected” — we specifically asked about the upcoming RTX 5070, and he says it’s not affected either. Nor should any cards be affected that were produced more recently: “The production anomaly has been corrected,” he says****. In case you’re wondering, he also told us that* ***Nvidia was not aware of these issues before it launched these GPUs.***\n\n**Here's NVIDIA's Full Amended Statement**:\n\n>*We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.*\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Quick Clarification from me:**\n\nIn the response above, NVIDIA mentioned \"one fewer ROP\". In this case, they are **referring to the Raster Operation partition**. **One (1) Raster Operation partition contains the eight (8) missing ROP units**.\n\nAlso, if you want to check your 50 Series cards with [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/), below is the **correct** ROPs amounts from [Blackwell whitepaper](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf):\n\n* **RTX 5090/5090D** = 176 ROPs (Affected units have 168 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5080 =** 112 ROPs (Affected units have 104 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** = 96 ROPs (Affected units have 88 ROPs)",
    "comments": [
      "Gotta love the fact that all those scalpers sitting on unopened boxes don't know if their cards are affected.",
      "Lol \"Rare\"\n\nI love how they also acted as if the results are something that they figured out inside of the company and not through other resources. Where did they get the 0.5% of cards effected? Absolutely out of their ass.\n\nThey either knew, or didn't know and both options are terrible for a \"High-End\" product released by the best company. This, the cables, the poor drivers bricking PC's, fake msrp, fake frames, fires. They have went downhill and need to wake tf up. Reduce the price of cards, fix the quality aspect of your products and be a good monopoly for once.",
      "If Nvidia knows which production defect caused this as some people have speculated, why isn't there communication saying that people who purchased the affected units will be contacted for a refund or replacement rather having to ask?  What percentage of people who end up with a Nvidia GPU have a clue what GPU-Z is?  How was the company able to very rapidly respond with a percentage of cards affected without prior knowledge of the issue?  The most likely explanation is seeming like someone at Nvidia figured out you can ship defective products and most customers will never notice.  I thought we had moved on from the GTX 970 VRAM era shenanigans given the market cap of this company now.  If mainstream media (not tech outlets) get onto this it will not be a great look, even if 85% of revenue is from sources other than gaming now.",
      "If they truly did not know about this, then that is actually scarily bad QA from company of Nvidia's size...\n\n\nBut I doubt that. Probably just pushed all the faulty chips out there in hopes people wouldn't notice or can't be bothered to RMA. Or to improve the already ridiculously bad supply, even if temporarily.\n\n\nWhat a joke this company has become.",
      "Scalpers don't care because the people who buy scalped cards have more money than sense",
      "Not even an apology. And they should make their driver auto inform any card owners the defect.",
      "What happened to quality control",
      "Lmao what a shit show of a launch",
      "100% they knew ahead of time and hoped people wouldn't notice.",
      "Its beyond me how such a large manufacturer does not notice something as easily detected as missing ROPs. Also even if i get a 5090 in 3 months when prices normalize i will still be checking this 100%.",
      "I'd wager that the majority of consumers are not aware of this issue.",
      "Since people DM me about the missing ROP, here is what MSI answered me yesterday :\n\n*We're sorry to hear that you're experiencing an issue with your MSI component, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.*   \n*For your convenience, please note that the warranty is exclusively offered through our authorized stores and resellers. To make a warranty claim and have your unit repaired, replaced, or refunded (depending on the available solutions), we kindly request you to contact the store where the item was purchased. They are well equipped to handle warranty claims and will guide you through the process seamlessly.*  \n*Your satisfaction is our top priority, and we want to ensure that you receive the best possible support and service for your MSI product.*  \n*If you have any further questions or require additional assistance, please feel free to reach out to our customer support team.*\n\nOf course I also contacted the reseller but no response so far. Which is strange because they usually answer very quickly.  \nI assume they are waiting for Nvidia/MSI directives about what they may or may not do regarding the warranty / replacement. I'll let you know.\n\nEDIT : The online reseller just contacted me, saying they will replace the card but they have no stock to do so at the moment. They suggest I keep the card for \"a while\" until they got more stock.\n\nSo I guess I'm keeping it for a few months or more. Well at least I'm gonna get a new card later so that's something.",
      "Interesting that NVIDIA has chosen not to offer even an apology for any of this. Just \"too bad, try your luck with RMA.\"\n\nI wonder if they even bothered to let the board partners know that they'll be needing to process these claims.",
      "This is a bad look at every angle and these gpus are $2000 premium should have better quality control",
      "Why couldn’t the error be the other way around",
      "In otherwords its wider spread than they claim and they knowingly sold faulty dies.\n\nLook back prior to releasing, there was a report on bad batches of wafers, they knew before release and chose to sell them anyway.\n\nAugust last year, reports of low packaging yield threatening release time tables.\n\nThey knew, and they knowingly sold defective dies to meet their release dates.",
      "Nvidia could easily put something into the driver or Nvidia App to check for defective cards and prompt the user to contact support for help.\n\nThey won't do that, but that would guarantee those defective cards are identified and returned.",
      "I really hope this is sarcasm.",
      "I am imagining they had such low stock of GPUs for the launch that somebody greenlighted purposely allowing defective cards through because they were gambling that having slightly more stock at launch would be less harmful to reputation and bottom line than some people having defective cards that they can RMA later once there's slightly more stock available.\n\nit sounds insane but i can't imagine a realistic scenario where these defective GPUs went through QA at TSMC and then at Nvidia and then at AIB partners with this problem and still made it to store shelves.",

I will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links. This will be sorted alphabetically.\n\n# Written Articles\n\n# [Babeltechreviews](https://babeltechreviews.com/rtx-5080-founders-edition-review/)\n\n>Upgrading to the new RTX 5080 from a 30 series GPU—or for those who simply demand peak performance—presents a clear decision. The price-to-performance ratio of the RTX 5080 is impressive, especially when viewed against the backdrop of NVIDIA’s previous generations or its current competitors. There is a uplift gen-over-gen of around 7-15% on average in raw power, when you consider DLSS 4 and its incredible uplift for max settings its really exciting. DLSS 4 is not perfect, however, and it cannot replace raw power for enthusiasts. The RTX 5080 also carries a higher price tag, albeit lower than the RTX 4080’s MSRP at $200 less. This is much better and the value it offers in enhanced performance, especially with advancements in ray tracing and AI-driven capabilities like DLSS 4, justifies the investment in our opinion.\n\n>We understand the inclination to wait for the more budget-friendly 70 and 80 class GPUs from the Blackwell generation, as these models often strike a balance between cost and performance, catering to the needs of the average gamer. However, for those seeking the pinnacle of current gaming technology, the RTX 5080 is unparalleled in its price range and class. It’s designed to deliver top-tier performance for years to come, making it an investment in future-proofing your gaming or creative setup. Ultimately, the decision to invest in such a high-end GPU depends on your specific needs and budget, but for those who prioritize leading-edge technology, the RTX 5080 is a wonderful new addition to the market.\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7hDtGh0wIo)\n\n>See Stickied Comment\n\n# [eTeknix Article](https://www.eteknix.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-review/)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKhoBBX2h00)\n\n>See Stickied Comment\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/review-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-reference/)\n\n>Depending on the game, performance improvements can vary widely. On average, you can expect a 10 to 25 percent boost in traditional rendering performance coming from a 4080S. The more effective part is NVIDIA's heavy investment in AI, deep learning, and neural shading. When we tested DLSS4 with frame generation enabled at 4x, the performance is simply incredible. However, the pressing question arises: will consumers be ready to invest in AI-assisted rendering? The answer isn’t clear yet, but time will tell. One thing is certain—DLSS4 works wonders. The performance metrics shown are a testament to its power. This GPU is quintessential for gamers using Ultra-Wide HD, Quad HD, or Ultra HD monitors, delivering a great visual experience with framerates to match. But yes, overall from the shading rasterization performance, the card is somewhat lacklustre\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5080 will speak to a lot more people compared to the $1999 costing RTX 5090. However, you'll get far less performance. Compared to the RTX 4080/4080 Super the overall rasterizer performance is a notch faster, but not heaps, and that is today's most disappointing news. NVIDIA invested heavily in the transistor budget for AI, the new generation of products places a strong focus on Raytracing, Neural Shading and of course DLSS4 with MFG (Multi Frame Generation). The combination of these together can easily bring in a fact x3 or x4 (and sometimes faster) result. Whether or not the end user is ready for artificially created frames in this degree we doubt, but as far as NVIDIA is concerned, it's the future. We do hope to see more backwards compatibility with DLSS 4 so that older games will get this new tech included as well. We stated this in the RTX 5090 review already, we wonder if the balance hasn't shifted towards AI assistance a bit too much. For the end-user change and thus a move away from the traditional render engine it will be a tough pill to swallow. The potential is huge though. For example, games like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, when combined with 4.0, could achieve over 150+ FPS at Ultra HD. Similarly, Cyberpunk in UHD did \\~180 FPS, that's with raytracing enabled. The recent move towards Ray reconstruction also moved NVIDIA into a new sweet spot. All features and performance combined with new technology like DLSS4 really make the Series 5000 from NVIDIA compelling. Other downsides for today's tested product have to be the high energy consumption and price level. In the end whatever we write, or how we feel about the AI-driven content doesn't matter. It's you guys that make the decisive purchase or not which makes this product series a success. The product is a notch faster than the previous generation if you look at that traditional render engine, however looking just that alone is not enough. With a whole lot of extra AI driver functionality that comes along with it, boosting your game FPS towards very high levels in the highest resolutions is possible with the likes of DLSS4 and MFG. Realistically though an RTX 4000 card with DLSS3.5 and Frame Generation will get you plenty of AI-driven performance as well. The founder card itself is lovely in design, it looks nice and it is reasonably silent. The power usage is somewhat icky. If you're coming from the RTX 3000 series or lower products, then this might be an attractive enough buy, but I think many of you expected to see RTX 4090 performance, or even slightly better. For that, you'll need a premium AIC OC version with a premium price. \n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-blackwell-review)\n\n>Last week’s launch of the [GeForce RTX 5090](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review), crowned a new king in the gaming GPU market. It’s pricier and consumes more power than its predecessor, but the RTX 5090 was performance leader across the board. The GeForce RTX 5080 is also technically an upgrade over the RTX 4080 in virtually every way, but its power consumption is in the same ball park and its introductory $999 MSRP is actually somewhat lower. That should be a great story, but the GeForce RTX 5080 is only a mild upgrade over its previous-gen namesake for gaming, unless you can turn on all DLSS features with multi-frame generation. It does, however, offer more of a boost with AI and content creation workloads.\n\n>When the GeForce RTX 4080 launched, it [crushed the GeForce RTX 3090](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-gpu-review) with many workloads. That’s not the case with the GeForce RTX 5080, but that was obviously not NVIDIA’s intention. The GB203 GPU powering the card is actually smaller than the AD103 on the RTX 4080, and it is manufactured on the same process node.\n\n>NVIDIA’s focus here was obviously on architectural advancements and AI-powered rendering. When you factor in the capabilities of RTX Neural Rendering and DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, the RTX 5080 separates itself from previous-gen offerings and offers clearly superior performance and technology. And therein lies the rub. Traditional raster will likely be less of a focus for the industry moving forward. NVIDIA is looking to the [future with Blackwell](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-architecture-overview), and they're not alone, as both AMD and Intel are on this path as well . As game developers incorporate more of the technologies available in the RTX 50 series, its performance profile relative to previous-gen GPUs will change. Though 75 titles will offer support for DLSS as of tomorrow (if you factor in the DLSS override controls in the NVIDIA app), we suspect revisiting the performance of these cards in a few months may tell a different story. AMD and Intel may also have some fresh competitors in the mix too by then.\n\n>That said, most consumers buy products for what they offer today, and not what they may potentially offer in the future. If you’re considering a card in the GeForce RTX 5080 FE’s price range, it is the current best option on the market. It’s faster and has more advanced features than a GeForce RTX 4080 and also AMD’s current flagship offering. It is not a significant upgrade over the GeForce RTX 40 series for gamers though. For owners of GeForce RTX 30 series cards (or older), however, the GeForce RTX 5080 will offer a massive boost.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-im-test-geforce-rtx-4080-ti-mit-blackwell-genen/)\n\n>The RTX 5080 is particularly impressive in Ultra-HD resolutions (3840 x 2160 pixels) with activated ray tracing and patch tracing effects. Thanks to the 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 fifth-generation Tensor cores and support for DLSS 4, the card achieves exceptional frame rates in graphically demanding scenarios. While the RTX 4080 Super lags behind the RTX 5080 in most benchmarks, the new card manages to deliver a smoother frame rate and better stability through the integration of multi-frame generation (MFG). This is certainly advantageous for those who believe they need something like this.\n\n>The improved ray tracing performance, made possible by 84 fourth-generation RT cores, is particularly evident in games such as *Cyberpunk 2077* and *Alan Wake 2*. With ray tracing enabled, the RTX 5080 also benefits from advanced ray reconstruction functionality, ensuring outstanding image quality in even the most demanding scenarios. Despite this impressive performance, some limitations can be recognized: In native 4K with maximum settings, the card may still remain at its performance limit, especially at high frame rates and intensive lighting simulations. Apart from these new features, however, the GeForce RTX 5080 remains a classic sidegrade and can hardly score with significant additional performance. Everyone has to decide for themselves whether they are disappointed by this. For my part, I had actually hoped for 20 percent.\n\n>The thermal design of the RTX 5080 is based on a double-sided flow-through cooling system that directs cool air through the card and efficiently dissipates heated air. During operation, the GPU temperature remains stable even in intensive gaming scenarios, with the card reaching a maximum temperature of just under 76 °C. The memory temperatures benefit from the optimized power supply via separate power rails, which ensure an even power supply. This minimizes thermal fluctuations and ensures that the memory area remains stable even under high loads. Thermal analysis using the Optris PI 640 shows homogeneous heat distribution, with hotspots such as the GPU and voltage converters being effectively cooled.\n\n>The noise development of the RTX 5080 is heavily dependent on the fan speed. When idling and at moderate speeds, the card remains pleasantly quiet, which is due to the low-vibration fan mounting and the aerodynamic optimization of the fan blades. Under load, however, the noise increases noticeably and reaches values of up to 38 dB(A). A characteristic humming at around 200 Hz was detected in the tests, which is caused by resonances of the fans or the voltage converters. This noise is particularly noticeable at certain fan speeds, but is not consistently audible.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-efficiency-gains-but-a-performance-letdown/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKIwmW5j6oc)\n\n>Only consider the RTX 5080 if you buy into Nvidia’s AI-fueled vision of the future\n\n>DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation feature must be seen (and felt) to be believed. On PCWorld’s Full Nerd podcast, we compared the leap from Single Frame to Multi Frame Generation to the leap from DLSS 1 to DLSS 2. When both technologies first came out, they showed promise but had plenty of rough edges. With DLSS 2, gamers agreed that Nvidia *nailed it*. And while it’s not quite perfect, Multi Frame Generation *nails it*. Once more gamers get their Dorito-stained paws on RTX 50-series cards, and are able to tool around with MFG in 75+ games and apps, I wouldn’t be surprised if all the furor over “fake frames” online dies down quite a bit. It’s a literal game changer.\n\n>But Nvidia is in trouble this generation if the masses *don’t* embrace Multi Frame Generation. Because when it comes to traditional gaming performance, the RTX 5080 is no game changer.\n\n>It’s a pretty damned terrible generational upgrade, actually. Eking out a mere 11 to 15 more render performance than the RTX 4080 Super, at the same price, at a higher power draw, isn’t compelling whatsoever. It can’t come anywhere close to last gen’s 4090. If you don’t like AI-generated frames — maybe you’re sensitive to latency, or you focus on competitive games, or you loathe the idea of AI frames potentially introducing visual glitches — I’d even go so far as to suggest picking up a 4080 Super to get roughly comparable performance for less cash.\n\n>Remember: The [RTX 3080 beat the RTX 2080 by *60 to 80 percent*](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393472/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition-review.html) when it launched earlier this decade, and it did so for just $700. Then [Nvidia jacked the price of the vanilla RTX 4080](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html) by *$500 dollars* for a 30 percent performance increase, leading to poor sales rectified only by the launch of the 4080 Super at $999. With the RTX 5080 barely outpacing that, the RTX 5080 would have been immensely more compelling at a couple hundred dollars cheaper. Two generations after the RTX 3080, Nvidia has truly devastated the xx80 tier’s value in recent memory. Upgrading from the 3080 to a 5080 will only get you about 40 to 45 percent more performance, for a price tag that’s 42 percent higher. That’s not progress.\n\n>If Nvidia didn’t have MFG in tow, this would’ve been a *scathing* review for the RTX 5080 itself. But boyyyyy does DLSS 4’s new tricks feel great. Multi Frame Generation makes *Star Wars Outlaws*, a notoriously janky game, feel just as good as *Doom 2016*. *Cyberpunk*’s neon Night City feels so much more *alive* when you’re racing around at a buttery-smooth 240Hz+, or over 150fps even with the game’s nuclear RT Overdrive Mode active.\n\n>And that’s the promise Nvidia needs gamers to buy into for the GeForce RTX 5080 — heck, perhaps this entire RTX 50-series generation. Are you willing to embrace “fake frames” and dip your toes into experiences that aren’t currently possible with traditional rendering alone? If so, this GPU provides enough grunt to fuel those adventures in 4K and 1440p alike.\n\n>If not, the RTX 5080 is one of the most disappointing GPU releases in a long time. It’s probably best to save your cash.\n\n>Me? I’m into the vision. But I wish Nvidia imbued the RTX 5080 with more raw rendering firepower, so it could be a decent upgrade even for “fake frame” haters. Nvidia didn’t, alas — so now the RTX 5080’s future hangs in the balance of those 75 DLSS 4 games working correctly at launch.\n\n>If DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation perform like a champ when that wider availability hits, it could usher in a new era of smooth, AI-supercharged performance. But if DLSS 4 winds up plagued by visual artifacts or other issues once the floodgates open, it could instead set off an explosion of “fake frames” memes and sign a death warrant for the otherwise ho-hum RTX 5080 — perhaps even the rest of Nvidia’s 50-series lineup.\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5090 can stand alone on its own merits, but the RTX 5080 is all-in on DLSS 4. All that’s left us to see is where the chips fall.\n\n# [LanOC](https://lanoc.org/review/video-cards/9135-nvidia-rtx-5080-founders-edition)\n\n>For performance, it will depend a lot on what your goal is for the card on whether you would say it did well in testing or not. Nvidia markets the card as a 2k or 1440p card and at that resolution and at 1080p it did extremely well, outperforming last generation's flagship RTX 4090. At 4k I would still say it did very well, but on average the RTX 4090 does edge back in ahead of it in our tests. The RTX 5080 has 16GB of memory and a smaller memory interface than the RTX 4090. It does have faster memory which makes up the difference a lot, but that does make a difference at 4k in some tests. That said, if you haven’t experienced DLSS 4 with the improved transformer models making significant improvements in the visual quality and frame generation x4 giving mind blowing performance, I would take that over the 8 extra FPS at 4k. Not only do you see a lot of those improvements even in CPU-limited situations, but you can see 300-500% performance improvements over not using DLSS at all. I didn’t run into as many of the bugs as I saw when testing the RTX 5090, but OpenCL-based workloads were still a problem but Nvidia is aware and working on it.\n\n>At the end of the day though, it always comes down to pricing. The RTX 5080 Founders Edition has an MSRP of $999. That is $200 less than the RTX 4080 launched at but is $300 more than what the RTX 3080 launched at. It’s also half of the price of the new RTX 5090. More importantly, how does it compare to other cards with current pricing? For that, I put the graph above together that takes every card I’ve tested’s Time Spy Extreme GPU Score and divides it by its current price as well as its launch MSRP. For current pricing, it is the lowest available price on PCPartPicker and it is interesting to see how much pricing and card availability has changed from last week when the performance of the RTX 5090 was shown. The RTX 5080 Founders Edition is sitting in the middle of the pack for value right now but there aren’t any cards faster or even near it in performance on the chart. With all of the talk on how it compares with the RTX 4090 for example, the only 4090’s you can currently get are $2598 or more. I wouldn’t call it a value, but if you are looking for high-end 1400p or 4k performance and the RTX 5090 isn’t in your budget this is the clear choice, that is assuming you can find these anywhere near the launch price once they hit stores.\n\n# [OC3D Article](https://overclock3d.net/reviews/gpu_displays/nvidia-rtx-5080-founders-edition-review/)\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-6Dw4qsGhA)\n\n>As we said in our introduction, the Nvidia RTX 5080 Founders Edition is almost famous before it’s appeared. Such is the incredible reputation of its similarly numbered forebears, the expectation is massive. The GTX 280 was launched 17 years ago, and apart from a couple of notable missteps – the red hot GTX 480 for example – they’ve all been stellar. It’s not a coincidence that when Nvidia introduced the RTX series of cards the top model was a RTX 2080 Ti. The name has cachet.\n\n>Clearly the RTX 5090 follows the recent trend where the 90 card is the flagship, money-no-object option. The x080 cards are for those with deep pockets, but not unlimited ones. Or perhaps those for whom gaming is your primary thing and so spending a little more is worthwhile. That’s where the Nvidia RTX 5080 Founders Edition comes in. We’ve yet to see performance figures for the guaranteed massive selling RTX 5070 and RTX 5070Ti models. That leaves us with either seeing how close the Nvidia RTX 5080 can get to the big RTX 5090, or how much better than the Ada Lovelace cards it is.\n\n>If the RTX 5090 was jaw-dropping, the RTX 5080 continues that good work. The next generation of cores which festoon the tiny PCB really put the work in to give you smooth performance. We know that the big ticket item is multi-frame generation, but even in pure rasterised benchmarks the Nvidia RTX 5080 Founders Edition proves a big upgrade on the previous model. If you’re just after the latest and greatest at an enthusiast price point, you can almost stop reading here.\n\n# [PC World Article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2591060/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review.html)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZT5OuW6v0)\n\n>DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation feature must be seen (and felt) to be believed.

Multi Frame Generation makes *Star Wars Outlaws*, a notoriously janky game, feel just as good as *Doom 2016*. *Cyberpunk*’s neon Night City feels so much more *alive* when you’re racing around at a buttery-smooth 240Hz+, or over 150fps even with the game’s nuclear RT Overdrive Mode active.\n\n>If not, the RTX 5080 is one of the most disappointing GPU releases in a long time despite its prowess. It’s probably best to save your cash unless you’re on a card several generations old and don’t mind spending big for a big performance upgrade.\n\n>If DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation perform like a champ when that wider availability hits, it could usher in a new era of smooth, AI-supercharged performance. But if DLSS 4 winds up plagued by visual artifacts or other issues once the floodgates open, it could instead set off an explosion of “fake frames” memes and sign a death warrant for the otherwise ho-hum RTX 5080 — perhaps even the rest of Nvidia’s 50-series lineup.\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5090 can stand alone on its own merits, but the RTX 5080 is all-in on DLSS 4. All that’s left us to see is where the chips fall.\n\n# [Puget Systems (Content Creation Review)](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-content-creation-review/)\n\n>Overall, the RTX 5080 is a solid GPU that provides good performance nearly across the board. However, following [our 5090 review](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-content-creation-review/), we are somewhat disappointed by the relatively small performance uplifts over the RTX 4080 SUPER. In some places, the 5090 seemed to justify the price increase over the 4090 with staggering performance increases. For the 5080, the same price seems to get you basically just the same performance in many workloads.\n\n>In **video editing and motion graphics**, the RTX 5080 is about 5-10% faster than the RTX 4080 SUPER and 20-30% faster than the 3080 Ti. There were some standout areas, such as 3D performance in After Effects, with gains double those. We’re still waiting on finalized DaVinci Resolve results, but we are doubtful the 5080 will be a huge upgrade over a 4080 or 4080 SUPER, except perhaps with LongGOP media. Still, for new-to-PC users or those on even older cards, it offers a solid upgrade.\n\n>In **rendering applications**, the 5080 manages better, with a 10-20% lead over the 4080 SUPER and a 55% to 188% lead over the 3080 Ti. This is definitely a performance jump that may be worth upgrading for even from the 40-series card, and it offers a great value for those using older generation cards. However, there is still the lingering issue of compatibility and performance quirks, so we would recommend buying with caution or holding off for a bit before committing to a 5080 for a rendering system. We are currently [maintaining a list of known issues](https://www.pugetsystems.com/blog/2025/01/27/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-known-software-issues/) in content creation applications that you can check in on to see when these are resolved.\n\n>NVIDIA’s new GeForce RTX 5080 is a great workhorse GPU that provides solid performance across the board and can handle most of the tasks you throw at it. In many workflows, it is only slightly slower than the RTX 5090, so it may end up being one of the better price-to-performance cards of this generation. If you are on a 30-series card or older, it offers a great upgrade, but less so for users on a 40-series card. Especially given the dwindling supply of those previous-generation cards, we expect the RTX 5080 to be an incredibly popular GPU.\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition/)\n\n>At 4K resolution, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 14% performance uplift over the RTX 4080 Super, 15% over the RTX 4080 non-Super. This is definitely MUCH less than expected and not nearly as much as what we saw last week from RTX 5090, which beat the RTX 4090 by 35%. Compared to the GeForce RTX 3080, the performance increase is 75%, which means NVIDIA missed the \"twice the performance every second generation\" rule. Last-generation's flagship, the RTX 4090 is 13% faster than the RTX 5080 and the new RTX 5090 flagship is 52% faster, but twice as expensive.\n\n>GeForce RTX 5080 is still faster than AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, Team Red's best GPU, by 15% in a pure raster scenario, much more in RT. AMD has confirmed that they are not going for high-end with RDNA 4, and it's expected that the RX 9070 Series will end up somewhere between RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 GRE. This means that AMD's new cards don't pose a threat to the RTX 5080, which might explain why we're not getting bigger performance improvements.\n\n>RTX 5080 is a good card for 4K gaming. With RT or Path Tracing enabled, some titles require that you use DLSS Upscaling / Frame Generation. The card is also great for 1440p gaming, to feed those high-refresh-rate gaming monitors.\n\n>NVIDIA is betting on ray tracing and Blackwell comes with several hardware improvements here. Interestingly, the RTX 5080 runs only 11% faster at RT than RTX 4080 Super—remember, we got +14% in without RT. It looks like this is partly due to the game selection. The games that show the biggest gains in our non-RT test suite do not support RT. Still, compared to AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX, the difference is massive—the RTX 5080 is 61% (!) faster than the RX 7900 XTX. On top of that, NVIDIA is introducing several new optimization techniques that game developers can adopt. The most interesting one is Neural Rendering, which is exposed through a Microsoft DirectX API (Cooperative Vectors). This ensures that the feature is universally available for all GPU vendors to implement, so game developers should be highly motivated to pick it up. AMD has confirmed that for RDNA 4 they have put in some extra love for the RT cores, so hopefully they can catch up a bit.\n\n>NVIDIA made a big marketing push to tell everyone how awesome DLSS 4 is, and they are not wrong. First of all, DLSS 4 Multi-Frame-Generation. While DLSS 3 doubled the framerates by generating a single new frame, DLSS 4 can now triple or quadruple the frame count. In our testing this worked very well and delivered the expected FPS rates. Using FG, gaming latency does NOT scale linearly with FPS, but given a base FPS of like 40 or 50, DLSS x4 works great to achieve the smoothness of over 150 FPS, with similar latency than you started out with. Image quality is good, if you know what to look for you can see some halos around the player, but that's nothing you'd notice in actual gameplay.\n\n>Want lower latency? Then turn on DLSS 4 Upscaling, which lowers the render resolution and scales up the native frame. In the past there were a lot of debates whether DLSS upscaling image quality is good enough, some people even claimed \"better than native\"—I strongly disagree with that—I'm one of the people who are allergic to DLSS 3 upscaling, even at \"quality.\" With Blackwell, NVIDIA is introducing a \"Transformer\" upscaling model for DLSS, which is a major improvement over the previous \"CNN\" model. I tested Transformer and I'm in love. The image quality is so good, \"Quality\" looks like native, sometimes better. There is no more flickering or low-res smeared out textures on the horizon. Thin wires are crystal clear, even at sub-4K resolution! You really have to see it for yourself to appreciate it, it's almost like magic. The best thing? DLSS Transformer is available not only on GeForce 50 series, but on all GeForce RTX cards with Tensor Cores! While it comes with a roughly 10% performance hit compared to CNN, I would never go back to CNN. While our press driver was limited to a handful of games with DLSS 4 support, NVIDIA will have around 75 games supporting it on launch, most through NVIDIA App overrides, and many more are individually tested, to ensure best results. NVIDIA is putting extra focus on ensuring that there will be no anti-cheat drama when using the overrides.\n\n>For $1000, there is no reason you should buy RTX 4080 or RTX 4080 Super now. AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX is $820, or 18% cheaper, but it's also 15% slower in raster, and 38% slower in RT. NVIDIA is also very strong in software features, the new DLSS Transformer model is a game-changer and DLSS 4 multi-frame-generation is a notable selling point, too. No way I would buy RX 7900 XTX at that price instead of RTX 5080—maybe if AMD drops the price considerably. Also, the way AMD is handling Radeon lately makes me wonder if their discrete GPU brand will still be around in two or three years. The upcoming RDNA 4 lineup will not target the top end of the market, so unless a miracle happens, RX 9070 XT won't be able to compete with RTX 5080, maybe RTX 5070 Ti, which is coming out soon.\n\n>If you already have a high-end GeForce RTX 40 Series card, then there is no reason to upgrade. You're just missing out on multi-frame-generation, the DLSS Transformer model is supported on all older RTX cards, too. On the other hand, if you're coming from GeForce 30, then suddenly you'll get to experience frame generation, which will make a huge difference for your gaming experience.\n\n# [The FPS Review](https://www.thefpsreview.com/2025/01/29/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-video-card-review/)\n\n>GeForce RTX 5080 performance makes us go hmmm. That’s an interesting way for us to start this paragraph, but the performance of the GeForce RTX 5080 is indeed all over the place. There are some games where the generational uplift looks exciting, and then there are others that make us scratch our head. It generally gives us a feeling of “hmmm.”\n\n>There are some good cases where the GeForce RTX 5080 is a nice uplift from the previous generation. We did see some 23%+ performance improvements, but those seemed to be outliers, more than the norm. Overall, it has somewhere between a 10%-20% performance uplift depending on the game and settings, Ray Tracing wasn’t that big. This isn’t enough to reach or match the GeForce RTX 4090 in performance. The GeForce RTX 4090 remains the performance leader in this regard. If you thought the GeForce RTX 5080 would be as fast as the GeForce RTX 4090, it isn’t.\n\n>Some of the results we have experienced make sense, after all, the raw specifications of the GeForce RTX 5080 are not that much upgraded from the GeForce RTX 4080 Super. The GeForce RTX 5080 is a GPU that is essentially a GeForce RTX 5090 cut in half, and the price reflects that as well. The GeForce RTX 5080 seems to consume about 17% more power than the GeForce RTX 4080 Super, and we get a performance increase that is close to that, some cases better, some cases worse.\n\n>Overall this means that the GeForce RTX 5080 at times follows a little too closely to the previous generation it is supposed to be supplanting. Often times we are left with a sense of a less-than-desirable gameplay experience improvement that one would expect from a new generation.\n\n>One could even call the GeForce RTX 5080 more akin to a theoretical ‘GeForce RTX 4080 Super Ti” or “GeForce RTX 4080 Super Super”, at least that is what it feels like. Keep in mind that the MSRP is $999, and that IS the same MSRP that the GeForce RTX 4080 Super was as well. Therefore, technically, it is a price for performance improvement, if pricing is at $999. It’s just that… it isn’t that exciting really.\n\n>As the GeForce RTX 4080 Super’s dry up in the market and the GeForce RTX 5080’s replace it, you will be getting a better gameplay experience with the GeForce RTX 5080. At the $999 MSRP, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 Founders Edition would be a solid upgrade from *prior generations*, such as GeForce RTX 3080 or GeForce RTX 2080 or even earlier.\n\n>If you are moving from an older generation prior to the RTX 40 series, the GeForce RTX 5080 will offer a good substantial upgrade path to modern features and gameplay performance at the $999 MSRP, but if you currently own a GeForce RTX 40 Series, unless you are moving from low-end to high-end, it is not going to be worth the upgrade.\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review)\n\n>Nvidia's RTX 5080 Founders Edition delivers what we were expecting, mostly. We can't help but feel that, like the RTX 5090, these first drivers made available to reviewers aren't fully tuned for the Blackwell architecture yet. In some games, performance looks quite good with reasonable generational improvements. In others, the gains don't materialize — particularly at lower resolutions.\n\n>What is obvious is that the RTX 5080 isn't a massive leap in performance compared to its predecessor — whether that's the 4080 Super we tested or the slightly slower RTX 4080. Nvidia's performance claims depend almost entirely on Multi Frame Generation (MFG), and that's disingenuous at best. Nvidia knows as well as anyone that a game running at 200 FPS with 4X MFG doesn't feel the same as a game rendering at 200 FPS without any form of framegen. Pretending that the resulting \"framerates\" are comparable requires serious mental gymnastics.\n\n>However, it's equally disingenuous to suggest that framegen/MFG are useless or \"fake frames.\" If you play a game running at 30–35 FPS without framegen and then try the same game running at 55–60 FPS with framegen, the latter feels better in my book. It's not anywhere close to twice as fast, but perhaps 20% faster. And if you use 4X MFG running at 105–115 FPS, that might feel another 10–20 percent faster than the 2X framegen result.\n\n>It's really just frame smoothing, but that smoothness interacts with your brain to make the game generally feel better, even if the base input sampling rate decreases slightly.\n\n>As a potential GPU purchase, if they're both priced the same, the RTX 5080 will be better than an RTX 4080 Super. That much is a given. Right now, it doesn't always win, but driver tuning should address any shortcomings. But if you already have a decent GPU, the benefits of the 5080 over the 4080 Super are pretty thin at present. If you didn't see enough in the RTX 4080 Super to entice you to upgrade in early 2024, the extra 10% performance plus new features that the 5080 offers isn't likely to change things.\n\n>If you're in the market for a $1,000 graphics card, and assuming there's enough supply to keep prices down, the RTX 5080 now sits on the podium as the second fastest GPU overall. It's half the price of the 5090, less likely to be continually sold out, and has all the other Blackwell architecture features. It's just nowhere near the potential 30% higher baseline performance we like to see with generational upgrades.\n\n>And if you're able to justify spending a grand on the RTX 5080, it's probably not that much of a stretch to double that for the clearly superior RTX 5090 that's over 50% faster on average — at 4K. The RTX 3090 was only 15% faster than an RTX 3080 four years ago, for double the price. For the well-funded gamer / streamer / AI researcher / etc., the 5090 is the clearly superior option. Which is one more reason we expect it will be hard to come by for quite some time.\n\n# [Computerbase - German](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-test.91176/)\n\n# [HardwareLuxx - German](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65395-leistungsplus-nur-ueber-mfg-die-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-im-test.html)\n\n# [PCGH - German](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5080-Grafikkarte-281030/Tests/Release-Preis-kaufen-Benchmark-Review-vs-4080-Super-1464610/)\n\n# [Elchapuzasinformatico - Spanish](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-review/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n# Video Review\n\n# [Der8auer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvQwlN1sE0U)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7hDtGh0wIo)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKhoBBX2h00)\n\n# [Gamers Nexus Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nShh_j4s2YE)\n\n# [Hardware Canucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFF7lMvpV-s)\n\n# [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEu6k-MdZgc)\n\n# [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meekBr-ZB1E)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKIwmW5j6oc)\n\n# [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoE8GQnDwQQ)\n\n# [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbg7ChsjmEA)\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-6Dw4qsGhA)\n\n# [Optimum Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7k4XWg-TcA)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZT5OuW6v0)\n\n# [Techtesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azD56D4_bFM)\n\n# [Tech Yes City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NwO1qrkEds)",

Much better performance, much better frame times, more features. If you were previously considering the 4000 series, this is a no brainer. Better performance at the same price.\n\nThe 5000 series is being compared to Turing. A lot of the new architecture is focused on neural rendering, but no games use it yet. Like Turing, these cards might age well in 2 years time.\n\nThe small Gen on Gen uplift is why everyone is upset. Neural rendering doesn't exist in games right now. Silver lining is that the 5000 series is the same price as last Gen.\n\n\n\nThere is so much room for a 5080 Ti or Super. The 5090 is getting something like up to 50% more frames over the 5080.

      "FOMO. People who like the new stuff will think about it, even when not necessary, myself included. I play my games in 4k and they all run splendidly. The new FE cards look super slick and are more to my liking, but I can't afford/don't need a 5090, so why bother. Still, if I could swap for an FE 5080, I probably would, mainly for the looks because my system is all black.",
      "nvidia were so cheap with 10gb of vram on the 3080, but man do I feel the same about 16gb on the 5080 for the asking price.",
      "Do not upgrade. This gen is dog water objectively, if I get downvoted for telling the truth so be it. Your card is good. Wait til at least next gen when they hopefully change the fire hazard that is the 12v connector",
      "No. I am getting 100+ fps on most of the games",
      "this gen is fine, but its massively overpriced",
      "So I went from RTX 3080 10gb to RTX 5080 16gb for around 1200€.\n\nOn RTX 3080 with resolution 5120x1440 (almost 4K, about 10% less than 4K)  \nAssassins Creed Shadows / All low/medium settings, DLSS Performance, FG on / 60ish FPS  \nBF2042 / All ultra, DLSS Performance / 110ish FPS  \nMinecraft with heavy shaders / 40ish FPS  \nKingdom Come Deliverance II / Ultra settings, DLSS Performance / 70ish FPS  \nCyberpunk 2077 / All max, DLSS Performance, RayTracing Ultra, no FG / 60FPS  \nAssassins Creed Origins / All max, 180% resolution scale / 18 FPS\n\nOn RTX 5080 with resolution 5120x1440 (almost 4K, about 10% less than 4K)  \nAssassins Creed Shadows / All max, DLAA (native resolution), FG on / 79 FPS  \nBF2042 / All ultra, DLAA (native resolution) / 110ish FPS  \nMinecraft with heavy shaders / 60ish FPS  \nKingdom Come Deliverance II / Experimental settings (Ultra+), DLAA (native resolution) / 60ish FPS  \nCyberpunk 2077 / All max, DLSS Performance, RayTracing Ultra, no FG / 85FPS  \nAssassins Creed Origins / All max, 180% resolution scale / 60 FPS\n\nThese are some benchmarks I did. Overall, in many games I got rid of need for DLSS Performance and got that sharpness back. Also got to use Frame Generation, it's nice to bump the framerate a bit. Generally the games that were around 40-50fps got to playable 60-70. And instead of playing with blurry low resolution 90fps I now play at full resolution 90fps. You also notice how VRAM usage for many games is more than 10gb I had before, usually around 11-12gb VRAM. I also got the VRR flicker now.\n\nEDIT: Build specs.\nRyzen 7 5800x3d   (big gaming improvement)\nRTX 5080 16gb      (the cheapest ZOTAC OC one)\nRAM DDR4 32gb @ 3660mhz\nMonitor: Samsung Odyssey G9 OLED\nPSU 850W be quiet!\nidk what else\nCouple of SSDs, a sick case, ASUS Motherboard",
      "As someone who recently made the same upgrade. Yes. I can finally play the way I want. Absolute max graphics. High framerates. It was OK before but never enough (for me).",
      "This is what I'm thinking of doing. Have a 10gb 3080 which is running fine for the most part but makes sense to wait for the 5080 super.  I know this is like asking how long a piece of string is but are there any talks/ rumours on 5080 costs ?",
      "just think about how 5070 is that thang has 12gb vram lol",

      "Again, Maybe for you! \n\nTodays extremes are tomorrow's norms. Just because 12gb is barely enough for now, doesnt mean it will be for long.",
      "I made the same jump and I'm extremely happy with it. I lucked out with a 5080FE so my upgrade was about $700 after selling my 3080.\n\n3080 is a fine card, but the 5080 is objectively much better, regardless of how much people shit on the 50 series. \n\nBeing able to play Cyberpunk in DLSS Quality with RT on and settings juiced at 90+ frames was fantastic. Far better than what my 3080 could achieve. I played Arc Raiders over the weekend with settings all maxed on Epic and used DLAA and played with 110-130 frames and that game looks fantastic. Being able to play on higher settings is important to me and makes the upgrade worthy.",
      "Ill be honest, I dont play anything competitive, framegen and upscaling are fuckin awesome lol \n\n\nI dont notice any input lag, and if there is some, its definitely not the reason im dying or doing poorly.\n\n\nThe problem is, some games use it as an excuse to NOT optimize. And I think thats a much MUCH MUCH bigger problem than the downsides of using framegen.\n\n\nNvidia being a not so great company nonwithstanding. Im not a fan of them by any means. Ive used both FSR3 and DLSS, no complaints. \n\n\nSome DLSS settings actually look visually better than without, which is the DLAA workin im guessing.\n\n\nIts no excuse to fuck the hardware up, but the tech itself isnt satan. lol",
      "Literally all of gaming is a recreational \"want\" wtf is your point. You're acting like RT is a luxury when gaming itself is literally a recreational luxury.",
      "Don't let FOMO get to you. \n\nInstead, buy when you are truly not getting acceptable performance from your rig. Note: acceptable does not mean \"it's not running at 1000fps like the 5090 does.\" Acceptable means you say \"I'm enjoying myself and my gaming experience is not being severely interrupted by the lack of performance from my rig.\"\n\nI am also running a 3080ti and despite all the crap it got in reviews, it has basically run every game I've played amazingly. It is aging very well (even the 12gb VRAM). I think it'll last at least through the 5000 series, and if the 6000 series also sucks, it could probably still hold it's own through that series.\n\nAlso remember how much money it's going to cost you!! Basically no 5080s in stock under $1400. That's A LOT of money for something you already have one of. You could keep that for the next REAL GPU upgrade Nvidia gives us.",
      "Maybe you don't need more than 12 and thats fine and good enough for you!"

One gaming oriented and one enterprise oriented. \nThey can make silent rgb with lots of vram gpus for gamers that are a bit cheaper and bulky thermal optimized black gpus for enterprise that have more robust internal components that cost way more. That would help drive down the price for gaming gpus.",
      "AMD seizes every opportunity to drop the ball on growing market share in desktop/consumer graphics. \n\nNvidia will keep giving people less for their money until AMD gets their shit together which has yet to materialize. 6000 series was solid and 7000 series was a missed opportunity by being priced too high relative to Nvidia and even the uplift over RDNA 2 for pretty much its entire cycle. \n\n8000 series will be overpriced at launch, get mediocre reviews for it then drop just like everything else AMD launches but by then it’s already too late."

      "Jesus Christ, and this is probably accurate too.\n\n5080 Founders Edition: $999.99 = $1434.64 CAD so probably $1499.99 MSRP.\n\nAIB = More expensive so yeah, these prices are likely spot on.",
      "what the fuck",
      "at what point do we just boycott this shit lol",
      "5000 cad after tax for an extra fan on the astral is insane, just get an different model and water cool it atp",
      "Holy. Well I think if you want a 5090 you’ll get one :)",
      "$200 more for the OC on Zotac? those extra 10 mhz must be worth so much!\n\nAlthough I guess the base model Zotac seems to line up with 5080FE USD MSRP so maybe that means it will be $1K usd?",
      "I bet these prices even have scalpers kinda nervous. Especially with the lackluster increases of this generation. That would be some next level desperation to pay a scalper 5k+ for these cards.",
      "Asus can go F themselves",
      "It's crazy because our wages are compared 1:1. So it's not like we make more money then Americans either.",
      "$4000 for an astral 5090 is definitely normal and something that should continue /s",
      "At this rate, the 6090 is gonna cost $6090",
      "wow so I got a good deal for my 4090 at $2100 cad lmao",
      "At these prices it makes the 5090 FE look like a \"deal\". Feels like there's going to be a bloodbath on [bestbuy.ca](http://bestbuy.ca) come Thursday when everyone tries to snag an FE.",
      "Wow the canadian dollar is more trash than I remember. Over 1500 dollars + tax for a founders 5080? The aib models will probably touch around 2 grand each. Crazy to think that a decade ago they were equal",
      "Good, that fucks with the retailer/distributor and they start screening with better anti scalper methods.",
      "My only saving grace is I live in Alberta where we only have 5% sales tax. Almost everywhere else in Canada is 10-15%",
      "Canadian 4090 owners sitting comfy right now",
      "It’ll be the FE models at msrp that will be the hardest to get if anything. Or the gigabyte wind force, that one looks to be msrp too.",
      "Man only $4k what a steal price, maybe I can drive around on one of these compare to used car.",

      "You’re arguing with ghosts",
      "That's pretty good based on exchange rate but still expensive. That's about as much as I've ever spent on an entire build. \n\nI think I'll hang onto my 3090 another generation and maybe go all out for 6090 or maybe 6080 if it's at least 24GB of VRAM. My 5900x will probably be rather long in the tooth by then as well.",

      "These GPUs are probably already there sitting in the back. So no, probably not this initial stock of GPUs.\n\nThe GPUs that are being sold next month? You bet your ass they're getting marked up",
      "Yep, I’m sticking with my 4090 for 4 years from now.",
      "Canadian here, I’ll complain why it’s 2000 USD in general, no matter what currencies you’ll be using. Prices are obscene.",
      "Give the senile greedy fuck a couple of months, he's gonna find a way.",
      "Yeah, Canadians usually get absolutely hosed on GPU pricing even after the exchange rate. Frankly I'm surprised to see it sitting almost exactly at US MSRP.",
      "That’s what 9am means lol",
      "That’s cool bro",
      "The price of 3 PS5 PRO, plus a few bucks.",
      "That's MSRP so good. But still too expensive. And can't find an FE in Quebec but even in rest of Canada its like finding a unicorn.",
      "That's because our dollar wasn't horse shit back then."

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/196aeo2b53ge1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=da05b4e9b4b1a53b38488c81e9fee744ee2baa4b\n\n\\*Note to everyone - this is a post in progress as I'm rushing to get the most important details for those of you planning your day tomorrow (edit - today...). So, please let me know if something is missing and forgive a bit of marketing copypasta for the moment.\\* \n\nFor a larger breakdown of the different ASUS GeForce RTX 50 Series cards, please check [our previous thread covering the cards in greater detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1hw2osj/introducing_asus_geforce_rtx_50_series_graphics/).\n\nAlthough you can zoom below for the availability details, some of the information here in the FAQ may also be important for some of you. If there's something I missed or you think would help to add, please let me know below.\n\n**Q. Will these all be available on Day 1 as listed?**  \nA. We expect that most, if not all of these will be available at 6am PST for the US. Of course, things happen sometimes and a particular etailer or retailer may have a website issue or may be pending for stock to reach them. Feel free to ask later in the day and we can track this down.\n\n**Q. What about Canada Day 1 sales?**  \nA. We do know more about CA stock in terms of what we expect to be in store on Day 1 and what is on its way. Short answer is that Canadians may need to wait a little for our GeForce RTX 5090 cards, but there will be some GeForce RTX 5080 cards available Day 1:\n\nFor Best Buy (CA):\n\n* TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5080 OC Edition\n\nFor Memory Express and Canada Computers:\n\n* TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5080 OC Edition\n* ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5080 OC Edition\n\n**Q. When should we expect the rest in CA?**  \nA. The shipments are currently on their way, but will likely take between 1-2 weeks to arrive (expect closer to 2 weeks)\n\n**Q. Will there be pre-orders?**  \nA. Not with this launch. If this changes, we'll provide an update.\n\nYes, there has been some commentary about certain AIBs may be doing a pre-order, but it won't be before the 1/30 6AM PT embargo time. If we do pre-orders in future waves, we will try to provide this information ahead of time.\n\n**Q. Any information about waterblocks?**  \nA. ASUS is working with all major waterblock manufacturers in preparation for the RTX 50 Series launch. It's important to note that unlike the previous RTX 40 Series, each graphics card uses a different PCB and will not likely share compatibility for the same waterblock design. However, we don’t have anything further to share at this time and it may be better to contact your preferred waterblock maker for details..\n\n**Q. Any information about ProArt, Dual, White cards, BTF etc.? When is the next wave of cards coming in after this one?**  \nA. Sorry everyone, I had hoped to have more information about those questions by the on-shelf date, but I don’t have any concrete dates or times. Let’s instead break down the general range that we expect or know to expect for the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 (no spoilers for the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 just yet) –\n\n* ROG Astral – RTX 5090, RTX 5080\n* TUF Gaming – RTX 5090, RTX 5080\n* ASUS ProArt – RTX 5080 (no ETA yet)\n* ASUS Prime – RTX 5080\n* BTF – Stay tuned for now.\n* White Cards – We will have them, but currently pending confirmation on the models and ETA. Stay tuned.\n\nAs we usually also note, we do listen to your feedback about what kinds of cards you want, whether you want to see more of a card series, additional white models (or fewer?), etc. Worst thing that can happen is that we choose not to take your advice, but we appreciate it and consider it for future models.\n\n**Q. Quick! What are the dimensions of the cards?**  \nA. Here you are -\n\nROG Astral LC GeForce RTX 5090 -\n\n* Card 288.46 x 153.7 x 48 mm\n* Radiator: 400 x 120 x 65mm\n* Slot Size: 2.5 Slot\n\nROG Astral GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 -\n\n* Metric: 357.6 x 149.3 x 76 mm\n* Imperial: 14.1 x 5.9 x 3 inch\n* Slot Size: 3.8 Slots\n\nTUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 -\n\n* Metric: 348 x 146 x 72 mm\n* Imperial: 13.7 x 5.7 x 2.8 inch\n* Slot Size: 3.6 Slots\n\nASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5080 –\n\n* Metric: 304 x 126 x 50 mm\n* Imperial: 12 x 5 x 2 inch\n* Slot Size: 2.5 Slot\n\n**Q.

      "MSRP is $2000 and you sell your card for $3000. $1000 for what? For your fat cooler and PCB? LMAO.",
      "Reserving this post for future stock updates.\n\nEdit 2/19 - I would have liked to update this more frequently, but graphics cards don't necessarily arrive in shipments like some of our other products do, such as monitors, which often come in waves - except for the first couple of shipments after launch.\n\nAfter the first couple of waves that have already come in, all of the initial etail and retail partners should have received stock and sold out.\n\nThe ASUS eShop should now correctly have links to all models that have been available, if you want to keep the pages open or bookmark them.\n\nAt this point, we're receiving shipments of our RTX 50 Series cards weekly and shipping out to etail, retail, and selling some through our eShop. For that reason, it's difficult to keep a running stock update for when you should expect to see certain GPUs or certain models at specific stores as stock will constantly be in transit. It's also important to remember that due to logistics, stores will receive stock at different times. Regardless, we are continually putting more cards into the channel, even if it still seems painfully slow for many of you. This means you just need to keep your eyes out for the model or models you want to purchase. \n\nI will also note that I'm still waiting to hear news about our white edition cards, ProArt cards, and any other unique models that we will eventually sell, but I have a feeling that we'll probably make a new post when these details are readily available.",
      "15% markup on TUF, 40% on the Astral base, and 55% on the Astral LC. Just... Wow.",
      "Why is it so expensive when it cools worse than the cheaper msi models?",
      "best buy lists the 5090 tuf that costs $1999 on their listings, will it not be available there?\n\nedit: I mean in the us.",
      "Hey Asus name cards Republic of Scalpers",
      "I don't know the stock quantity to be honest, and I wouldn't be able to disclose much detail if I did. Trying to gauge the first day of a new NVIDIA release is difficult, as even a lot of stock can sell out very quickly.\n\nFor restocks, I asked our team yesterday, but it's too soon to provide next restock information. However, I'll keep this post updated and I reserved a comment for stock updates, provided it doesn't get downvoted.",
      "Generally, the cooling is very close from the initial reviews I saw, but it's a fair question.\n\nOutside of the cooling, if you take most of what I talked about above, and directly compared the MSI card, there are differences in terms of the build quality, a number of the included features (such as the PCB and 16pin sensors), even the number of thermal pads on the backplate. It's not that any one of the features jumps up and bridges the price difference, but the totality of the ROG Astral design begins to add up to the difference in price.\n\nThe other factor to consider is that the cooling performance in reviews is essentially a Day 1 snapshot. Over time, many factors come into play that will affect performance and cooling (such as repeatable build quality and design), and this is one of the reasons we chose to go with phase change thermal pads because it will provide the longest sustained performance and consistency among choices for cooling the GPU, not to mention easier for end-users to clean if they take the card apart.\n\nIt's a perfectly reasonable position to take that the MSI Suprim, for example, may be more to your liking because it's cheaper and seems to cool quite well in reviews, but I think the Astral cards also provide value for those looking for a bit more in an already expensive card.",
      "Now, what do those Astral cards do that an FE does not?",
      "Well, since you asked...\n\n**Card and aesthetic design:**\n\n* The ROG Astral uses a CNC-milled exterior on the die-cast metal shroud, frame and backplate.\n* Look closely at the shroud, frame and backplate to see how the card is able to self-sustain its shape with reinforced bracing while also protecting itself against torsion; essentially preventing sag while also providing integrity to the PCB to combat micro-fractures for long-term stability\n* Blacked-out heatsinks\n* Prismatic filter RGB Lighting\n\n**PCB Design:**\n\n* [The power delivery system is always much more involved on ROG cards to provide better power delivery and monitoring, including 80A MOSFETs](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-5090-astral/5.html)\n* Sensors are embedded in the PCB to track GPU, memory, and VRM temps and viewable in GPU Tweak III via the Thermal Map functionality\n* 16-pin PCIe power connector monitoring is included to verify that your power connector is fully-seated and can notify you even which pin is not seated properly in GPU Tweak III via a tool called Power Detector+\n* A conformal coating is applied to the PCB to help protect the card from short-circuits caused by dust, liquid, and debris\n* Let's not forget that the card includes a pair of FanConnect II PWM headers and two HDMI 2.1b ports\n* The GPU Guard also helps to keep the processor securely attached to the socket for long-term stability. Why is this an issue? With the size and length of cards these days, the weight can cause some level of bowing and microfractures inside the GPU socket, ultimately leading to failure.\n\n**Cooling Design:**\n\n* For brevity, I won't go into much detail about the quad-fans, vapor chamber design, heatsinks, fins, etc. because testing results already show that the ROG Astral is excellent for cooling - especially in comparison to the Founders Edition.\n* Phase Change thermal pads are used for the GPU, while others are trying liquid metal, combinations of liquid metal and thermal paste. This matters because the phase change thermal pads have significantly greater longevity than thermal paste does and is much, much easier to clean up than liquid metal paste if you ever decide to open up your card. Liquid metal can cool better, but not by much (and we tested), but is a lot harder to clean up.\n* Some of you may have also caught that we're using a thermal pad on the backside of the 16pin power connector to reduce heat during normal operation.\n* Speaking of thermal pads, the ROG Astral includes [more than a few on the backplate](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-5090-astral/4.html).\n\nThere are plenty of reasons that you might prefer the Founders Edition over the Astral, and we completely understand that, but there are also a lot of reasons to like the ROG Astral GeForce RTX 50 Series models, as well.",
      "GPU clock speed and price. I don't think we will update the clock speeds until after the sales embargo lifts later this morning.",
      "Okay it still doesn't explain why the performance is so bad for the price. This thing should obliterate every other card for the premium",
      "I hope you will consider 5090 ProArt. Love the look but disappointed it's only for 5080.",
      "There is two sku for the Tuf edition 5090, the OC and none OC but I can't seem to find the actual difference between the two. Could you please elaborate? Only the OC has a tech spec online.",
      "You should have this amazon page corrected, showing incorrect title and specs. Should be Prime Non-OC, but shows as Tuf  \n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTPG3B1N](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTPG3B1N)",
      "I'll check with our team tomorrow to confirm, but the list I have doesn't show that sku at Best Buy tomorrow.\n\nEdit - Great question. Seems like one model was left of the list I received, but I can't confirm yet if it was specifically that model.",
      "Can you even see any of the 5000 series on their shop?",
      "I did ask, but currently no end date has been set for the pricing. If/when I hear that changes, I'll update the information.",
      "Unfortunately, I cover only the US/CA region. You'll need to reach out to your local ASUS sales team for further information on that side."

So if you're a window shopper like me, or actually want to compare them before buying, now you can! \n\n* **MSI and Asus'** cards have both been fully reviewed by Techpowerup, as well as major youtube reviewers Hardware Unboxed and OC3D TV, respectively. \n\n* **Gigabyte** has not yet been reviewed by a major outlet. The single review on youtube, by [Radium PCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmEOKR1E_SI), is very brief and IMO lacking in data. A handful of youtubers have done unboxings, but to the best of my knowledge, only one English-speaking youtuber has posted stats- by combing the streams of [THE RAFCAVE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_4lDDw0zSsl49JtKQuLHlg) I was able to find slightly more data on IRL performance. \n\n**Special Considerations:**\n\n* **Size:** The Astral and Suprim are 3 slot cards, whereas the Waterforce may fit in 2. The Astral is largest by volume, at L288.46 x W153.7x H48 mm, the Suprim is a close second at L280 x W148 x H51mm, and the Waterforce is by far the smallest at L245 W146 H36 mm\n* **Cooling**: The Astral and Suprim's coolers appear to liquid cool the GPU die and memory only, using their single card fan to cool the VRMs. The Waterforce entirely relies on liquid cooling with no card fan.\n* **Thermal Interface:** The Astral uses a Phase-change pad similar to PTM 7950, wheras the Suprim uses traditional thermal paste, and the Waterforce uses liquid metal to contact the GPU die. The Astral and Suprim use traditional thermal pads for the other components, wheras Gigabyte uses thermal putty. \n* **Radiator:** The Astral fans connect to each other and the card via the same proprietary magnetic connectors found on the ROG Ryujin III AIO,  Gigabyte connects via standard PWN pin wire but its fans snap together like Lian Li's Uni series, and MSIs simply are wired and do not lock together. \n* **RGB:** All 3 models feature RGB on the cards themselves. The Astral and Waterforce have RGB on the radiator fans, the Suprim does not. \n* **12VHPWR:** Only the Astral has sensors to detect and alert the user to amperages exceeding spec on the 12vhpwr cable. For the Suprim or Waterforce, a cheap option could be installing a product like the [Wireview Pro](https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/en/wireview-gpu/s-tg-wv-h1r) from Thermalgrizzly to monitor amperages. \n\nAdditional Resources: \n\n**Youtube**\n\n* Hardware Unboxed did a [very good detailed review of MSI's Suprim Liquid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjs0l5bGRks).\n* OC3D TV [did a somewhat good review of the ROG Astral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAd3czS5D84) (No teardown, unfortunately) \n* Radium PCs [Waterforce review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmEOKR1E_SI&t=126s). (Better than nothing) \n* RAFCAVE game streamer's [unboxing of the Waterforce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFLeo7DP7h0&t=1058s) and [game stream with performance data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbGsgf4-NGQ&t=917s)\n\n**Techpowerup Value and Conclusions**\n\n* [Astral 5090 LC ](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-5090-astral-liquid-oc/42.html)\n* [Suprim Liquid](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5090-suprim-liquid/44.html)\n\n**Manufacturer** \n\n* [ROG Astral 5090 LC ](https://rog.asus.com/us/graphics-cards/graphics-cards/rog-astral/rog-astral-lc-rtx5090-o32g-gaming/)\n* [MSI Suprim Liquid 5090 ](https://www.msi.com/Graphics-Card/GeForce-RTX-5090-32G-SUPRIM-LIQUID-SOC)\n* [Gigabyte 5090 Waterforce ](https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N5090AORUSX-W-32GD#kf)\n\n**Reddit**\n\n* A thread in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1ka4ny7/comment/mpk9zrf/?context=3) in r/Nvidia contains discussion from Astral LC and Suprim owners. u/Abarthtard97 was kind enough to message me about their experience with the Suprim at 600w. \" I will say that 66C on 600W was the highest I got after a 10 minute run of fur mark\" ",
    "comments": [
      "ive been trying to get my hands on a suprim liquid since day one now.\n\nive \"bought\" 4 of them so far, but walmarts canceled every one so far...",
      "I'm skeptical. It ran 66c at 500w. It's undoubtedly better than most air AIBs but that's not exceptional for an AIO card. \n\nGigabyte using liquid metal tells me that they knew their cooler wasn't the best so they had to make up the difference at the thermal interface.\n\nThe lack of reviews 4 months after launch also tells me that perhaps Gigabyte knew it would be underwhelming so they didn't make review samples available. Looking back,  the 4090 waterforce was reviewed to be almost the same temp as the air cooled 4090 strix so Gigabyte didn't have a stellar cooler design to build upon here.",
      "ASETEK gen8 v2, same one with 4090 matrix, dunno what they are smoking at TPU",
      "Asus using Asetek pumps which works at fixed speed, MSI one stops at low temps, Gigabyte has a liquid metal variant as cooling paste which tends to leak at vertical setups, i would go for MSI, not much negative feedback so far",
      "Mixed emotions on my ASUS LC 5090. The magnetic fan connector is garbage and breaks easily. I've ended up using Artic fans on the radiator instead. Temps are incredibly low,< 55c in 3DMark.\n\nOn the other hand, the per pin monitoring is first class. Quite scary the difference in current depending on cable and positioning. No wonder people's GPUs burn.",
      "If you are really committed to getting one (like, willing to pay for a bundle where you'll have to sell the monitor they force with it), you might want to keep an eye on the MSI website. I managed to get one last week bundled with a QD-OLED, and it was in stock for a couple hours.",
      "My astral lc has a constant pump noise which makes me wanna get a refund tbh. Do yours have it?",
      "You're literally the first person I've seen on reddit with the Waterforce! \n\nI'd love to know what the temps are under load! Is the card noisy? How well can you OC? Have you noticed any quirks that I didn't account for?",
      "From what I've read it doesn't seem like it does per pin amperage, just average amps- but the temp sensor would serve as a good proxy because an imbalance of amps will lead to overheating.\n\nThermal grizzly did do a demonstration video on their pro version, perhaps check that out?",
      "I think a fair amount of people that would get an AIO card would do so to avoid the hassle of what you described.  Yes, done well a custom waterblocked card will cool much better, but it requires an intimidating level of skill where alot can go wrong, and they're expensive cards to mess around with. \n\nBut hey, if you're confident doing that stuff more power to you, it definitely takes skill",
      "I have Astral 5090 LC and I recommend this card, for me from these three it looks like this 1) Astral LC 2) MSI Suprim Liqud 3) Aorus Waterforce, honestly if I didn't manage to buy Astral LC the next step would be MSI Suprim Liqud (before Astral I had Suprim liquid 4090 and I was satisfied), from what I know Waterforce 4090 had some problems",
      "I got the waterforce 5090. If anyone has questions let me know",
      "IMO the 5090 Waterforce is likely the best AIB 5090 on the market. Fully cooled by a waterblock, exceptionally rare, and largely unreviewed.",
      "Lol small world, my magnetic connector broke and I'm using Arctic p12s on the rad now too",
      "The data for the Suprim and Astral were pulled from Techpowerup's reviews. They performed temp and OC testing with identical setups so that data is directly comparable.\n\nGigabyte I could only find two online sources that discuss performance. At the time of this post, there are no significant reviews online of that card that I could find.",
      "I dunno, a lot of the reviewers seem to be getting good cooling, noise, and performance results. Some concerns about longevity but that's basically it. The reviewers I've watched, including Hardware Unboxed seem to be reluctantly admitting the liquid cooling makes sense for the 5090 since otherwise the board is enormous.",
      "oh you know, its $500 cheaper than the astral.\n\nalso, wtf?  b&h had them in stock recently?  like, actually available on their website up for sale in stock?   ive been on their waiting list for that since a couple of hours after the pages went live, and i never got my invite to buy one.",
      "No, at least I don't hear anything, but I've just read that someone had this happen, if you can, return it or exchange it, it can't be that a card at such a price will make strange sounds or anything that will bother the owner",
      "Mine is silent.",
      "I have the radiator installed as exhaust on top of the case.\n\nAlso replaced the stock fans with lian-li lcd fans and haven't tested stock.\n\nThe stock fans are connected via single cable. This cable is hard wired into the GPU and you cannot remove it without disassembling the card. Which is not a good idea to do with thermal putty and the liquid metal.\n\nIt has audible coilwhine during high load. I have 3080TI TUF which is notorious for having loud coil whine. The Gigabyte coil whine is quieter, I would say its not terrible. With my luck I don't believe I could find 5090 without coil whine. All my recent cards had it.\n\nThe pump had weird noise for first 3 days. Almost like scratching. I wanted to return it. But it went away.\n\nThe pump is NOT controllable at all. And you CAN hear the pump if your setup is dead quiet. Im talking 400RPM fans. Then pump is really audible.\n\nTo give some example. I have panorama AIO for CPU and if I put the pump on 75-100% its a lot louder the then Gigabyte GPU. But if I speed control the AIO then the Gigabyte pump is louder while the AIO cannot be heard. Thats my biggest and only gripe with this card.\n\nI wont be able to give you much details on the temps as it really depends on my fan curves since Im not using Gigabytes.. That being said If I choose aggressive fan curve I can maintain around 63c full load during games.\n\nWith my prefered 900rpm fans the temps are around 73c. But the card is dead quiet compared to my 3080TI tuf. I only hear coil whine basically.\n\nI also really like the fact all the heat is exhausted directly from the case. At first I installed it as intake and the whole PC case was very warm.\n\nI haven't touched OC besides 3k on memory. While trying to put above 150mhz on core games would become unstable. I have seen it boost to 3.1ghz by itself. I want to undervolt it eventually but haven't tried it yet.\n\nIn my personal opinion. The cooling performance on this card is exceptional. The design is the best looking. For those reason I will keep the card even though its pricier. Got it for 3005€ (tax incl)  I might have portraited it here as loud.. but far from it. My coway airmega airpurifier on the quietest setting is louder then the pc during load. And the air purifier is 3m away from me while the PC is on my desk."

    "title": "Which RTX 5090 model to choose?",
    "selftext": "Hello, I read 20+ reviews on these three rtx 5090s non reference cards\n\nMSI RTX 5090 SUPRIM SOC\n\nASUS ROG Astral  RTX 5090  OC\n\nGIGABYTE AORUS  RTX 5090 MASTER\n\nAnd I simply can't decide between them, which one should I pick,\n\nI currently own an rtx 4090, more specifically MSI RTX 4090 Suprim X and it's a fantastic card, been using it for almost 2 years now, haven't had any issue and according to one completely disassembly teardown it uses some very high grade and quality panasonic caps and vrms and I absolutely love the sleek, stylish and kinda stealtty look of it.\n\nBut when I read a few reviews on the new MSI RTX 5090 SUPRIM SOC I noticed right away they changed some of the design, that wouldn't be an issue, but the included anti sag stand isn't made out of solid aluminium anymore, but some sort of cheap plastic. Even that I could  chew through really, but supposedly they didn't change the 12V-2x6 connector and it's still upside down like it was with my the rtx 4090 suprim x card that I currently have. So this time around, in preparation for the graphics card upgrade I bought a  Seasonic Native 12V-2×6 90° Cable - [https://seasonic.com/native-12v-2x6-cable-90-degrees/](https://seasonic.com/native-12v-2x6-cable-90-degrees/)\n\nAnd I bought it for the very purpose so I can route the cable under the card and not have it touch the side panel of my case like I have now that Iam using still with the older psu along with the atrocious adapter that came  with the rtx 4090 suprim x card...\n\nBut out of all these three non reference cards only the one from MSI has this upside down 12V-2x6 connector\n\nThen there is the ASUS ROG Astral  RTX 5090  OC,. This one looks the best out of them all, even though the 4th fan is a gimmick really according to several reviews, and it uses basically the same cheap plastic anti sag stand. But it looks to be the best version according to all the reviews I read through, the best designed pcb, really high quality full metal shroud and achieves the best overclocks aswell,\n\nBut the main issue is that it is ASUS, and they are well known to be really pain in the ass when it comes to RMA process. I know about it I have been through it several times with my older, very expensive three times RMA'd ultrawide monitor that is now dead, because the cost of the repair was astronomically and comically so high I made a decision to buy a brand new QD oled 4K monitor instead and it was still by almost 900 euros cheaper than getting it fixed. It's a long story,\n\nIf anyone is interested, It's here >!it was RMA'd a total of three times, Long story short, the first RMA was due to the cracked screen due to a stupid sibbling throwing a water bottle cap at me and it hit and cracked the screen, I paid 1300 euros for the repair at the time, the swapped the panel, cracked screen and the cracked frame , Then the second rma was much less expensive, because of the broken back side joystick nipple that controls the OSD, it was only around 30 euros, but after a while during spring of last year it started to have this weird problems of the panel starting to degrade, on the top right corner I noticed quite a lot of simmering lines and artefacts, at first I thought the cable was going bad, but nope on almost the first summer day it completely flashed white, the entire screen and then went black and suddenly no picture was on, only a white backlight was visible and when I send it to the RMA for third time, they wanted to charge me 2400 euro for the entire repair of the whole panel because the warranty for the last repair bascally expired only a few days after it happened. Just my luck. It was almost as much as I paid for it in 2019 which was 2700 euros and it was then I decided not to go through and only pay for the return shipping and buying a completely new monitor.  This was my somewhat unlucky and terrible experience with asus support.!<\n\nSo I have a few doubts at the back of my mind because of my experience with the asus support and RMA process.\n\nAnd then there is the The GIGABYTE AORUS  RTX 5090 MASTER, which again has the correctly positioned 12V-2x6 connector, but supossedly Gigabyte use composite metal grease(not liqiud metal) on Aorus Master and ball bearing fan and they downgraded from R15(little to no whine on 4000 series) to R10 chokes which are prone to whine.\n\n[https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/threads/5080-5090-coil-whine-thread.18998069/page-8#post-37632255](https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/threads/5080-5090-coil-whine-thread.18998069/page-8#post-37632255)\n\nBut I really like the look of the aorus card, especially the include anti sag bracket is a much higher quality one than what msi and asus has, but the issues posted on overlcockers forum makes me ignore this card completely,\n\nOn top of it not a lot of reviews are out for this particular model, which is really bothersome, that after almost 2 weeks after the original launch there are almost no reviews. I only found one here\n\n[https://www.eteknix.com/aorus-geforce-rtx5090-master-ice-32g-graphics-card-review/](https://www.eteknix.com/aorus-geforce-rtx5090-master-ice-32g-graphics-card-review/)\n\nAnd the review is really shallow, doesn't go really into any depth when it comes to it's inernals, used components and pcb design.\n\nWhat are you thoughts? Please help decide\n\n\\*EDIT\n\nI just noticed there are upside down 90 angle cables from corsair specifially designed for the MSI cards of rtx 5090s\n\n[https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/pc-components-accessories/cp-8920352/corsair-psu-90-12v-2x6-style-b-cable-cp-8920352?srsltid=AfmBOopCuLsXjE974EbBy-inHJNm-OvmyNdPvIAKbhkapYAjeSspu86j](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/pc-components-accessories/cp-8920352/corsair-psu-90-12v-2x6-style-b-cable-cp-8920352?srsltid=AfmBOopCuLsXjE974EbBy-inHJNm-OvmyNdPvIAKbhkapYAjeSspu86j)\n\nand according to their article\n\n[https://www.corsair.com/us/en/explorer/diy-builder/power-supply-units/corsair-12v-2x6-90-degree-angled-gpu-power-cable/](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/explorer/diy-builder/power-supply-units/corsair-12v-2x6-90-degree-angled-gpu-power-cable/)\n\nThey can be used on any PSUs Brand there available unless it has the native 12V-12x6 connector\n\nI currently have the  Seasonic Prime TX-1600 Noctua Edition and I bought the [https://seasonic.com/native-12v-2x6-cable-90-degrees/](https://seasonic.com/native-12v-2x6-cable-90-degrees/) cable so I can route it under the rtx 5090, but it can only be used with the asus and gigabyte cards, Because MSI cards have the connector upside down, For that I need to get he aformentioned 90° angle cable B variant from corsair, but that one is out of stock everywhere, LOL.\n\n\\*edit 11.3.2025\n\nSo today I recevied two email notifications about the availability of the aorus master that it willl be available to pick up on 12th march in the store. So i might actually go for this one, despite the various troubles some users are having.\n\nI rather go for astral, but the availablity is still non existent even now at the start of march. Whats more troubling all the asus rtx 5090 cards in the stores have no sooner availability than at the end of april and even then it will be few pieces.\n\n\\*edit 14.3.2025\n\nSo I managed to pick up the rtx 5090  phantom gs from gainward, but promptly returned it, because it had terribly loud coil whine and on top of it, it cost 3219 eur, astral was \"only\" 280 euro more expensive.  \nAnd the phantom gs had terrible performance and temps, over 80°C when gaming\n\nBut the next day the rtx 5090 astral OC version was available to pick up from a different store and I could not have been more happier, so I returned the gainward card and picked up this beauty and it's reaching max 63°C under max utilization and the oc performance is incredible, even without undervolting thecard I can overclock the core to 2902 MHz and memory to 29900 Mhz, It's stable as a rock. And even with overlclock the fans barely go above 45% and temps are 65°C and if I ramp up the fans to 100% the temps under max utilization the temps are well bellow 50°C...unbelievable, but the card then sounds like a jet engine",

      "Do you really need a 5090 *right now*? Your 4090 is the second-fastest consumer GPU in the world. So, you're not missing out. \n\nI would wait until 5090 stocks and prices normalize (to the extent possible). There is no need to overspend, even for a 5090.",
      "Whichever one pops up in-stock first, and you can beat the bots to.",
      "You don’t have a choice unless you’re paying resale. Idk why people act like they wouldn’t take the worst 5090 if it was in stock.",
      "Iam not dreaming at all, just wanted to ask opinions of other fellow enthusiasts. It's more than obvious the stock is pretty much non existent, but in 2 months time they will be available.",
      "It sounds like you have your heart set on the Astral, which would be a fine choice. Your RMA experience with ASUS is obviously concerning though. I’ve owned plenty of MSI and Gigabyte products with no issues - my last MB was a Gigabyte. \n\nThat being said, stock is so supremely low right now I wouldn’t obsess about which AIB to choose from. My 4090 was a Zotac, a brand everyone shit on when I bought it in 2022, but it was a wonderful card. I would get whichever you see in stock.",
      "Are we thinking pricing is going to normalise? I don't think 2025 is going to get more stable.....",
      "Stock will definitely improve, and demand will most likely decline as people buy more 5090s at these ridiculous prices, which will stabilize prices. Prices are this high because people are buying. But, as soon as people stop buying, they will deflate. \n\nThe current hype is artificial. Demand is not as great as they make it seem. They just didn't have enough supply for the few who really can afford these pumped up prices. Had they produced an adequate number of units, they would be sitting in store shelves like the 4080 did at launch and long thereafter.",
      "I actually have both the Astral and Aorus and prefer the Aorus. The Astral is a bit louder without touching the fan curve, it also has coil whine, not as much, but still there. My Aorus runs quieter, can't hear any coil whine, its clocking higher to almost 3000mhz stock compared to the 2800mhz of the Astral, and looks great.

      "a restock is due to late march to mid april according to the orders on my local electronics store.",
      "Hello,\n\nnope still waiting, ordered at the end of january through various retailers and eshops, but only one sent me an email that the card will be available on april 3rd, its the gigabyte aorus one\n\nThats nice you managed to get an attention of asus rep on their forums, but I did not, nobody responded to my rog forums thread I made a few years ago :( Are you from EU or America?\n\nI envy you, the astral card is the best looking out of all of them and is a great performer in terms of oc and cooling, but the availability is zero still unfortunately.\n\nI own a motherboard from gigabyte, the aorus master z 790 and have had zero issue with it so far, had it for 3 years now almost. ALso bought last year the aorus FO32UP 4K 240 hz qd oled and zero issues with it aswell, it's a wondeful monitor. And over the years I had various graphics cars from gb, to be specific, two gtx 670s and 970s and one 980ti and no problems with neither of them aswell.\n\nI myself too read about those issues with fan rattling due to cheap ball bearings in the fans themselves on the aorus rtx 5090 master. But it is the only card that has a less than a month availability out of all the three I mentioned in the thread. Personally I would want the msi one, since I own an rtx 4090 suprim soc from msi and its a sleek, stylish card and performs well even under max utilization only reaches about 64 °C . But I wouldn't say no to the astral card from asus either, especially since your praise and personal experience with it.\n\nDO you have by any chance photos of your case, how it looks with the rgb. Also what about the noise, I heard the position of the 4th fan mounted on the top has this werid issue with air turbulunce noise.\n\n  \nThank You for your very informative and thought out reply",
      "I’m in the same boat got rid of my 4090 (Palit Omniblack) and I’m looking a ‘premium’ 5090. I’m leaning towards the Aorus Master as I prefer the aesthetics the most. Wouldn’t listen to anyone making a fuss over it, it’s your money and it’s just jealousy lol",
      "Exactly this, from my past experiences with cheaper versions of cards I would never go that route again",
      "Sorry I guess I should have been more clear. I was on the ROG subreddit. That's where the Asus rep DMed me here on reddit. I'm located in America.\n\nIt's funny that we've had very different experiences with the gigabyte stuff. Though I did have a x670e Aorus Xtreme motherboard that was really nice. I think the biggest pain point when it comes to gigabyte is how awful the software is. What's funny is that Armoury crate use to be the worst. But the last year I've used it, I haven't had any issues with it. Works quite well.\n\nI was looking into the fan issue with Aorus 5090s. There was a post where some guy took it apart. And it was actually the frame underneath the fan that would cause the clicking sound. So when the fan would start to slow down, that's what caused the clicking sound. That really doesn't give me confidence in the card being well built. A cheap fan is one thing. But the fact that it's the frame causing the issue, is a pretty big concern (for me anyways) it's a shame because the Aorus does look pretty cool, it's my 3rd favorite I would say.\n\nAs for fan noise on the Astral. There was a Vbios update for the quiet mode that addressed the issue. The fans can get loudish in performance mode. But that can be fixed using the Asus tweak 3 software. You just lower fan 2 by a little and it's way better. Though even without that, I don't think it's unbearable whatsoever.\n\nI loves the Suprim cards for 30 and 40 series. I feel like 50 series was a bit of a let down, looks wise anyway. The backplate just looks far too plain for my taste..the light says \"Suprim\" looks really cheap imo. The little diamond in the corner of the card looks great though. I had a 5080 Suprim and ran really well. I returned it though once I got my Astral.\n\nI haven't taken any good photos of the card yet. But I'll post the 1 I do have\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kz8mdey0lbme1.jpeg?width=6144&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1958c4b08a45847834ce9b64bfa52a49c3001064"

      "Have you tried unplugging the rear fan? I saw derbauer do this with the 5080 and I'm assuming it's the same design for the 5090.\n\nI get my 5090 today and if I can just unplug the rear fan and then set a sensible curve for the ones on the front I'll do that.\n\nThe correct solution would be for Asus to provide one curve for the front 3 fans and one for the rear fan so people could just turn that one off or to min rpm and then adjust the front 3 to get the cooling they want.",

It takes 120minutes or so to encode 14min 8K raw video (8192x4320, 12bit) of Canon EOS R5 in Adobe Premiere Pro. how long will it take to encode same video with RTX5090?\n\n2. My monitor has 5k(5120x2160) resolution. Would it be possible to get minimum 60fps in 3D games with full option, especially ray tracing on without any Deep learning based tweak like DLSS, frame generation ? \n\nIf you have any information that could answer these questions, please let me know.\n\nAlso, I would like to hear your opinion about upgrading from an RTX 3090 to RTX 5090 for video editing and gaming with my circumstances. \n\n",
    "comments": [
      "It's a massive upgrade\n\nDLSS upscaling is fantastic and you should be using it",
      "Yes I went form 4080s tp 5090 it's night and day. \n\n\nIt runs cooler . My case.is coole by 10 degrees it never reaches hotter than 65C and that's full utilization. \n\n\nStandby is 36C .\n\n\nFans never turn on the heatsink is so large  \n\n\nDlss4 is to me the biggest improvement combines with rasterization of course to gaming we had in a long time. I know some are knocking it . \n\n\nYou have an actual owner of a 5090 here telling you you wil not see artifacts .\nYou will not see ghosting.  \n\n\nYou will just get massive FPS . \nThey talk about 600 watts of power. .\n\n\nIt doesn't use that unless your purposely stress testing it .  What game utilizes 100% of the 5090. Barely any .\n\n\nExcept cyberpunk amd Indiana Jones with frame reconstruction. Ray tracing \"native\" or \"quality\" and path tracing turned on . In 4k .\n\n\nEven than I hit 480watts I think . Occasional spikes to 575...\n\n\nRegardless it's the best Nvidia product I've ever owned . And I was a naysayer. I said I'm keeping my 4080s and fake frames all of this.\n\n\nI got thr opportunity of a lifetime at MSRP . I purchased and sold my 4080 immediately.  \nI am so freaking impressed by it . \n\n\nAnd I'm 4k and 24phz and 4k 240 fps . My jaw dropped.\n\n\nAlso it's 32gb of ddr7 helps me with large language models and at home OLLAMA AI projects . \n\n\nI train my own AI on my own PC its requires fast and a lot of VRAM .\nBuilding uncensored models . Teaching it stiff . Making it read books and talk to me about topics other online ones won't. \n\n\nThat's my hobby anyways..hope I helped\n\n\nEdit : BTW . I encode and export videos from gaming and streaming VOD from capcut and yes it still takes some time.  But with a 5090 you can do the export and encoding while even gaming at the same time. It is that powerful.",
      "im coming from a 4080 and I already feel like I got such a massive upgrade in 4k.",
      "Yes",
      "4080 is definitely capable at 4k especially with dlss but I wanted a 5090 to really take advantage of my 4k240hz OLED monitor.",
      "For point 2 then you will be able to get 4K@ 60fps in a lot of newer games without turning settings down.  Nothing wrong with a bit of a boost from DLSS either.  It’s better than people like to say.\n\nNo idea high much the uplift will be while encoding.  One of the few things you can directly compare on sites though.  Must be some encoding benchmarks out there.\n\nThe 3090 was a good card but the power to performance is way off compared to newer cards.",
      "Do it",
      "im on a 4080. takes me 2 minutes to render a frame (1024 samples at 1080p). A 5090 will reduce it down to 1minute (although.. at twice the power usage from 220 watts to 450 watts..) Most of my projects take anywhere between 70 hours to 150 hours to render. So cutting the time in half is well worth it.",
      "for me i went 3090 to 5080. i think a game i was getting 80 fps with the same settings it went to around 140 + mfg x3 its nuts on the difference",
      "A 4090 is a worthy upgrade. Im astounded even the cheapest 5090 is over 100% more expensive then what my 4090 was",
      "Same. Even though I believe my 4080s was capable of 4k no issues.  I ran it in 1440 due to my competitive game nature. Now with dlss4 on the 5090 series 4k is AMAZING",
      "So you would say the 4080 wasn't giving enough fps in 4k?",

      "Any idea where and how I can do that?",
      "I'd honestly advise just stick to the default Bios and just undervolt + overclock the card\n\nBios has no bearing on how far you can overclock unless you want to push the card to 600w. Which i would advise against, due to the power connector issues.",
      "Second this. I just had the choice to buy the TUF OC vs non OC and was baffled why the OC version was $500 more in Australia. Turns out, there is no real difference! Only that the default BIOS is set to 600w allowing that tiny bump in frequency without needed to load any software to change it. Simply install Tweak III, move the slider about 2 mm and boom, you just saved $500. It's crazy. Don't flash the BIOS. Simply not worth it. Just get the non OC card, install Tweak III and you're done. The card is such a beast, I actually prefer running it at 575W (which you could always do with the OC version too). That's the point. They are the identical cards and in no way is the non OC version limited."

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nSo, I've read a million articles about PSU compatibility with the 5090 and now I'm feeling pretty down... I already have a [COOLERMASTER MWE Gold V2 1250W](https://www.coolermaster.com/en-global/products/mwe-gold-1250-v2-full-modular/?tab=tech_spec) PSU, and my [ASUS TUF Gaming RTX 5090](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rtx5090-32g-gaming/) is on the way. Previously, under fairly high and frequent loads of 4090 (AI-related), everything worked without issues.\n\nNow, when I see information saying that **ATX 3.0/3.1 is required**, I have no idea how well my **ATX 2.52** will handle it, considering it was released around the time of the RTX 3000 series...\n\nPlease help me understand, kind people!",
    "comments": [
      "Where are you seeing anything about ATX 3.x being required? It's recommended but not required. More than likely you'll be just fine with the PSU you have. If ATX 3.x were a requirement, then the card wouldn't even come with the adapter to connect 4x8-pins, since you'd be expected to use the 12VHPWR cable that comes with the PSU. The inclusion of the adapter is already proof they didn't make ATX 3.x a requirement.",
      "Good point! All the information around psu\\\\5090 compatibility is driving everybody (me included) nuts...",
      "Yeah, it's a mess. But you should be more than fine with that PSU, and worst case, it can't handle the transients or something and shuts down under load, and then you get an ATX 3.1 PSU. But it's a good platform and 1200W should be able to absorb the transients just fine, so I really don't anticipate you'll have any problems.",
      "ATX 3+ has a requirement to handle high transient power spikes -- times when the GPU requests a lot more power for very short intervals, like in the range of milliseconds. \n\nThe spec requires that if your PSU is running near its rated capacity, it can still handle those power spikes. However, if you have an ATX 2 PSU and it's rated for a good deal higher power than you're normally drawing, it should be able to handle those power spikes, especially if it's a higher quality single rail model. \n\nSo in the off-chance you experience issues like random reboots while running the GPU at 100%, then you'll likely want to replace your PSU. If it works fine, then keep it until it's near end of life at 7-10 years.",

I used to keep tabs on PSUs with charts people made to show how good they were but it’s been several years since I’ve bought one.",
      "If psu has a 12v-2x6 port labeled, is that better than one with a 12vhpwr port labeled instead?",
      "Should be if it's a decent platform, but I'd like to know the particular brand and model before saying for sure since there are some not so great options that have been sold over the years at the 1050W level.",
      "Yeah, everything I said to OP applies to you as well. More than likely everything will work just fine, since that's a solid platform and plenty of power.",

Doesn’t seem to have any trouble running off 1,050w.\n\nI might be more concerned if I had an intel chip given the higher wattage requirements. But I haven’t seem to hit any power constraints.",
      "Thank you for your response. I assume then, you're also using an 12V-2x6 to 4x 8-pin adapter, is it a non-angled one and, if so, how flexible is the cable? I'm asking because I'm looking at cases that are wide enough to fit and information on the adapter specifically is surprisingly hard to find.",
      "Yeah so I get confused by all the name conventions. I’m using a native 12VHPWR-to-12VHPWR (I think). The PSU has a 600w 12VHPWR slot and the card has one slot, so I’m using the 1:1 cable. Whatever it’s called, the new looking one. \n\nI have mine bent slightly, it flexed alright. I know best practice is to not flex it, but the flex is fairly gentle to fit in my Meshify case.\n\nI have the Meshify 2 Lite. One of my favorite cases. Really thoughtful layout, good amount of room for everything while not being overly huge."

Even if it is a cable/connector wear issue and (hopefully) you are safe once you've built your PC, it's a pretty invisible issue. Does everyone need to test their cable any time the touch the connector?",
      "This is extremely concerning. We could make some guesses based on what Roman said:  \n\nIt is highly likely that the connector has a large difference in resistance therefore the parallel connection results in uneven loads. This is further likely because everything is one line on the PCB. I have not checked the power supply but i would expect that the 12VHPWR connector there also goes into a single rail.  \nA proper calibrated high sensitive resistance measurement would be able to confirm this theory.  \n\nEitherway, this is incredibly concerning and a reason to not push the 5090 FE to its limits for the time being. I personally would go so far as to undervolt it as much as possible and rather take the loss in performance than risk melting.",

The second is a comparison between the 5080 and 5090. \n\nThe basic thing here is that a 5070ti is around 83% of the cuda cores of a 5080 and has the same vram, bus width, etc of the 5080. So, the 5070ti costs 25% less for 83%+ of the performance (likely to be an even narrower gap than 17%). \n\nMeanwhile, the 5080 to the 5090 is a literal doubling of cuda cores, doubling of vram, and doubling of bus width.

      "I don’t get all the doom and gloom comments here….\n\n1. This isn’t some ploy to sell more cards. It doesn’t matter if the reviews dropped today, launch day, or if no review cards went out at all… every single card available on release will sell out pretty much instantly. Nvidia doesn’t need to resort to tricks to make that happen, it’s how pretty much every GPU launch in the last 20 years has gone. By the time steady stock is readily available, everyone will have had all the time they need to watch every review. \n\n2. There may be a gap of a few hours between when the embargo drops and when cards go live for sale. I seem to remember this happening with a few past GPU launches. \n\n3. You don’t have to buy the shit day one. If you think a 5080 may be the right card for you, but want time to thoroughly research it… take the time to thoroughly research it, and then buy it when you’ve made up your mind. People act like when new tech drops, they must have it day one. Why? If you’re worried, just don’t freaking buy it. \n\n4. Review embargo’s are absolutely necessary and a good thing. Without them, you’d have a lot of publications focused on being the first to publish. It incentivizes doing a poor job to scoop up views. Embargo’s level the field and ensure everyone has the same amount of time to publish a quality review. That in mind, separate dates for the two cards also makes sense. This ensures publications focus on the 5090 first (which Nvidia obviously wants), and then the 5080 after. A day sooner would have been nice, but given that it’s already a short gap, I have a feeling that’s an every day counts sort of situation."

So, just to test and confirm this, I booted up a 64-bit PhysX application, Batman Arkham Knight, [and PhysX does indeed work there](https://i.imgur.com/cAq2X32.jpeg).\n\nSo, basically, Nvidia silently removed support for a huge amount of PhysX games, a tech a lot of people just assume will be available on Nvidia, without letting the public know.\n\nEdit: [Confirmed to be because of the 32-bit CUDA deprecation by an Nvidia employee.](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/557200/geforce-grd-57242-feedback-thread-released-21325/3501715/)\n\nEdit 2: [Here's a list of games affected by this.](https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtx-50-series-gpus-have-dropped-support-for-32-bit-physx-many-older-pc-games-are-impacted-mirrors-edge-borderlands-etc.1111698/)",

Run an backend application to send data continuously to multiple frontend devices\n\nSo based on this requirement, we have shortlisted the following configuration:\n\n1. RTX3090(value for money) or 4090\n2. ⁠NVLink Bridge with either 2 or 3 slot depending on the card\n3. ⁠Motherboard that supports PCle 8 lane split\n4. ⁠ATLEAST 24GB VRAM\n5. ⁠The latest 5090 with 32GB would be preferred\n\nNow, we are confused on whether the ADA5000 or ADA6000 series would be more appropriate than RTX4090 or RTX5090 since we have been seeing that ADA series are more preferred than RTX for specifically AI workloads, but the benchmarking of RTX series seems to be way better.\n\nPlease weigh in your thoughts on this, whether the configuration above seems sufficient for our workload and any suitable links for buying and building our workstation.

    "title": "RTX 4090 dies under warranty, won't replace it, what now?",
    "selftext": "[Resolved]\n\nSo, I bought an MSI RTX 4090 Gaming X Trio about 2 years ago, brand new, from MSI's Official Amazon pgae. My GPU has been working and being used correctly, (high quality PSU, no overclocking, ect.) Then about 2 months ago I had a serious problem and my GPU would spin up my fans to the max while my monitors lost connection but I'd hear sound.\n\n Long story short, after spending hours of my time diagnosing the issue and trying to resolve it, it was for sure the GPU at fault, so I paid $120 to have it shipped all the way to Sacramento to get it fixed, including the power cable. I got it back about a month later and put it in my pc and had the same problem within hours after they sent it back to me, put it in my Wife's computer and same issue. \n\nI called customer service back and told them of the issue, got it sent out about 2 weeks ago, and just got an email stating that it was unrepairable and not replaceable. They offered me some money back,  but not much, and said it wasn't going to be the $1,750 I paid for it because their \"3 Year warranty\" isn't actually a warranty, it's only prorated.\n\nSo, now I'm completely lost on what to do. I don't have the money I did two years ago when I was able to buy this card, and I figured it would last at least until the warranty was up (I've have Nvida and AMD cards for numerous years, and never once had a hardware issue with any of them). So what should I do? I can't get another 4090 as they are over $2,000 on the used market right now, and can't get the only card in the world that's better than it (5090) for obvious reasons. Even the 5080 is far worse than the 4090 and I'd still have to pay extra just to get that downgrade If I was even able to find one. I'm sitting here numb, at a loss. Is there any wisdom or help you guys could provide? Thank you very much.\n\n[Edit] \n\n- I just filed a compaint aginst MSI on BBB and FTC (heard back from only the BBB)\n- I also contacted the MSI spokesperson and emailed them requiring a replacement or upgrade (see resolution)\n- I also emailed Gamers Nexus like you all said. (no reply)\n\n[Resolution]\n\nSo, after a good couple of days after I made this post, MSI finally resolved my issue (as much as you can expect them too). About a day after I filed multiple of those compaints, they responded with: \"The RMA is unable to repair your card which is why we are asking if you are okay with the refund.\nPlease kindly share me a copy of your initial component purchase and I will check with RMA Dept if able to process item price refund. Thanks.\" \n\nAfter that, I sent them my recipt they asked for and I specified that I'd much rather a replacement 4090, but if that was not able to be done (it has been out of production for a few months) then I'd accept a 5080 or 5090. They then waited some more time before responding. The next time they responded was in response to the BBB contacting them and asking for a resolution, in the resolution they stated they already offered a full refund that I did not accept (They offered me hundreds of dollars less than a \"Full Refund\"). I then see in an email from the MSI spokesperson that they are going to: \"We will refund you $1748.99 as we do not have an equivalent replacements to offer\". \n\nSo, with that being said, I'll take that offer of a full refund, as that is what I paid 2 years ago. I spoke to multiple people at different times who told me that they had ZERO 5080s or 5090s in stock. Since, this resolution is more expensive than sending me a 5080, I'm inclined to think they are at least out of 5080s. This isn't the resolution I wanted, but it's good enough, as I'm tired of this fighting which isn't face-to-face, just screen-to-screen. I'd rather just have a 4090 back, but it looks like I'll be buying something different now. Likely getting an RTX 5080 with that money, or an RX 7900 XTX. They have somewhat similar FPS in most games and the prices are less than what I paid for my RTX 4090. Thank you all for the help and wisdom!",

      "\"isn't actually a warranty\" is an outrageous statement given they explicitly list it as a warranty and the warranty length on their own store.\n\nYou live in the United States, they are legally required to make you whole. \n\nIn this case that means either a refund for the original purchase price or a functioning product of equal value.  It's common for MSI to play these games where they'll offer you a lower end product or less money that what you are entitled to.  If you accept those offers, you agree to taking less than you could have gotten.\n\nLet them know you are entitled to be made whole and may else wise be forced to take legal action.  Post this on other social media to put pressure on them to make it right.\n\nAll else fails, if your account of the story is correct, this is an extremely easily win in small claims court.  You will likely win by default given the cost to pay someone to travel and lodge in your state likely exceeds the value of the replacement.\n\nThe other comments in this thread telling you to just move on and buy a different card are capitulary.  All the big AIBs do this nonsense and just giving up encourages them to do this more.  Taking them to task will make them reconsider screwing their customers monetarily.",

If you would like to verify the warranty term of the product bought, please kindly contact our local offices.\"\n\nThey don't disclose said extra terms and they don't even provide a number to call (easy to implement a region selector that provides the correct number) or link to where the person could even further inquire about them.\n\nThe thing is, under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, companies are required to clearly and reasonably disclose these terms to customers.  They are impeding customers from learning about these said full terms in three ways:\n\n1. They don't disclose them online or at the place of sale.\n2. They require you to call in to learn full terms.\n3. They don't even provide the number for said full terms (at least not where one would reasonable expect it).\n\nIt's beyond shady that they are hiding warranty terms to such a degree.\n\nI will note though that Gigabyte's warrant IS prorated (but at least they provide the full terms FFS):  \"If a Product is near the end of a given warranty period and a repair/replacement is not possible, GIGABYTE reserves the right to offer an alternative of equal or greater value or a partial refund proportional to the remaining warranty life of the Product.\"\n\nI'm not sure when this trend started or if other companies are doing it but consumers should push back against it.  Prorated warranties make no sense for GPUs.  GPUs are not consumable products that quickly burn through their life in the mere 3 year warranty period.  Most of my GPUs last 10+ years.  GPUs are far too expensive and this is clearly a move to push customers to buy more often.  God i miss EVGA, screw these big corpa AIBs.",

I have replaced PSU, Memtest 86'd the RAM, and swapped the GPU out with a friends 5080 and was unable to reproduce the crashes, therefore the 5090 is clearly the culprit.\n\nI tried to RMA the card, but the US website wouldn't let me go through with the web form (even though it let me register the product and gave me the 4 year warranty on this same subsidiary, screenshot of my warranty is included here). I called the service center, but was told that they would not honor the warranty as I no longer resided in the country I bought it from, even though the card is the exact same one that is bought in the USA, and all the cards are manufactured in China.

    "selftext": "Around 5 days ago I was selected for priority access which is great because I've been patiently waiting for a new gpu for months. I ordered it and it shipped via FedEx 2 Day. \n\nCome the day it is supposed to arrive the delivery eta keeps jumping up a few hours until finally the day ends. Then the next day (Friday) at around 10:30am it says delivered and signed for by \"L. SA\" which is not how I would sign/initial but it is related to my legal name. It isn't anyone in my household. It wasn't any neighbors nor the building manager in my apartment complex. I was home all day and nobody came to deliver it. \n\nI called Fedex and opened a claim but they really couldn't provide me more info other than it was signed for and that they would look into it.\n\nI was just wondering what should my next steps be. I tried finding a place to contact Nvidia but there didn't seem to be much info for support on orders from their site. \n\nI am also wondering if people who have ordered one of these priority access gpu's remember the box they came shipped in. I was just curious if it was very obviously a gpu because maybe that contributed to it getting stolen. \n\nFinally, I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips with dealing with Fedex. This is the first time this has happened to me and I'm not sure how to proceed... \n\nThank you ",

      "Yes! Mine was delivered to a wrong address and signed for by someone else. I almost shit my pants. I called FedEx and opened a ticket, when all of a sudden the FedEx driver pulled up in front of my house. \n\nI was very confused so I ran out and told him he delivered my package to a wrong address and was signed for by a specific name. (MMiler) After looking at his clipboard, he copped an attitude and said, “I’ll be right back.” \n\nIf a FedEx truck could peel out, it would have! He was back within 5 minutes. I’m glad he cared enough to correct his mistake. I wanna know who signs for a package that isn’t addressed to them or isn’t under their name? 🤦‍♂️",
      "Sure, it was a “Mistake”… he probably was keeping it and had to pretend to go get it",
      "The shipping company usually won't help you because you're not the customer. You have to raise hell with Nvidia and then they have to deal with Fedex as they are the customer being the shipper. \n\nHow this usually goes is they always try to pass the blame to you. Fedex will deny everything and just say they delivered it to the correct address (lie). Nvidia as the company you bought the product from usually won't push that hard and just accept that answer and will tell you that they can't do anything as the package was delivered to the correct address (wrong). \n\nSince this is such an expensive item I would just do a charge back if it plays out like this and they try to force you to eat the cost.",
      "I agree that he probably had it in his truck all along. Similar thing happened to an OLED monitor delivery: App show it was signed for, saw FedEx pass my house; so I ran down the street to ask him about it, prompting a similar peeling out down the street. Looking like he only drove around the block, he walks up to my house and hands me the monitor.\n\nAll because I called him on it.",
      "Nvidia packs it in an unmarked box. however, the label WILL specify it's coming from Nvidia.  \nwhen you open the unmarked box, you'll find the foxconn box with the peelable strip",
      "The chargeback sucks and you should absolutely do it if NVIDIA won’t help you.\n\nJust be aware doing so means you’re done ordering from NVIDIA.\n\nSo I would try everything else first.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if NVIDIA took you to court for the amount. Probably not but they theoretically could.\n\nThen the court would decide whether fedex delivered your package or not.\n\nThe fact that the signature doesn’t match doesn’t mean much. Anyone can purposely sign incorrectly.",
      "Oooof. Okay that's good to know. I've never had to do a chargeback or had any issues with packages but hopefully Amex is chill",

      "Does your home/building have a CCTV?\n If yes, you could send them the footage of that time frame (delivery) and threaten them with legal action. Use the same to get NVIDIA involved too.\n\nAlso, I am surprised they don't use OTP's (One time passwords) for high value items. Drivers should not be allowed to mark it as successful delivery unless the passcode is shared",
      "Wow, their employees are stealing all the cards lol",
      "Better hope im not your Fedex driver",
      "The fuckers wouldn’t deliver mine for 4 days and cited “delivery attempt failed” with a Picture of a random street last week. I had to blow up corporate for days to force them to let me pick it up, cause they left it at the shipping center with no re-delivery date. FUCK FEDEX",
      "Fedex driver is gaming at 4k right about now.",
      "This is why I always try to setup pickup at nearby hub for expensive purchases, especially if you live in an apartment. It eliminates risk of theft, but also driver negligence if they leave it at the wrong address or ignore the signed delivery instructions (which seems almost always).",
      "Nvidia probably puts insurance on the package.  I'd be surprised if they didn't do this.  I have to ship laptops for my company, and we always put insurance in case of loss even with a signature required."

      "Probably better chance of running into Jensen at Walmart",
      "I absolutely changed my mind. Seeing the reviews presented three problems for me. \n\n1.) The performance isn’t there. I was hoping for more of an uplift. While a lot of my gaming would benefit from the MFG, I’m not satisfied with the overall performance increase. I’m on a 4080 Super, and it seems like a great value given the review numbers. The 5090 truly does feel like the 4090 TI. If I had infinite money, I would definitely upgrade, because why not. But I don’t. The cost for the level of upgrade is simply too much.\n\n2.) The FE model has the concerns I was worried about, including noise and temperatures. Everyone was gushing about how amazingly engineered it was before we had actual numbers. And while I agreed, I kept raising concerns about the actual performance. It seems my concerns were justified. Additionally, it’s going to be very hard to get, given that it is an online only release. I never had any plans to try to battle the bots. So the only card available at the actual $2000 price point is basically going to be unobtainium.\n\n3.) The AIBs are just too damn much money. If I’m not comfortable spending more money on what I see as a less valuable upgrade (5090 FE), there’s certainly no way in hell I’m going to spend more money still on the AIBs. The value proposition sinks dramatically when considering them. Given that the cost per frame isn’t fantastic to begin with, the AIBs just really make it worse. I was planning on going to Micro Center to camp it out, but I can’t in good faith raise the cost of this purchase even more substantially for even less performance. $3000 after taxes for a 30% performance bump is stupid.\n\nI’ll admit it, I am bummed out. I expected a lot of this to some degree, but when all presented together, I just can’t make sense of the purchase anymore. I suppose in a way, Nvidia and all of the board manufacturers have done me a favor. I won’t have to camp out in a strip mall overnight worrying about peeing in a bush and getting mugged. But it is a disappointment.\n\nI’m either going to keep my 4080 Super or I will seek out a reasonably priced 4090. I probably don’t even need to do that. I just have the itch to upgrade after weeks of edging, and unfortunately, I think I just have to deal with a case of blue balls.",
      "i wasn't even tempted to upgrade my 4080 Super so after reading all this stuff it just reassured me that i'm not missing out",
      "Yeah, I was on the fence about upgrading to the 5090 from the 4090. I was assuming I could sell the 4090 and then put that to the 5090 but I think I’ll hold off this generation. It looks like the 4090 will be faster than the 5080 so it really doesn’t make much sense to upgrade at the price point they are asking for. I was wondering if I missed something and somehow the 5090 was 50%+ faster than the 4090 but it falls short of that for sure. The only thing that is currently really making me consider it is the DP 2.1 for when 4k 480hz OLED panels become a thing. But I’ll wait 2 years and get all of that expensive stuff then.",
      "Even if you are rich, coil whine and hot ass rooms are not something you would want to deal with",
      "The 1.3x performance uplift was as predicted and today's didn't really change my mind. Will upgrade to 5090 anyway. DLSS 4 looks fantastic and looking forward to use MFG.",
      "But that has nothing to do with the reviews that dropped today which was the point of the post. \n\nAnyone who has a 3 series and is ready to upgrade, there's no excuse not to choose one of the 5 series. \n\nEvery single card in that lineup is better than the same named version of the 3 series. \n\nEveryone's so caught up in this 4 series versus 5 series which is weird because normally you should be skipping a generation or two. I wasn't even aware that people bought gpus every generation. I'm not sure why we're focusing these reviews in that fashion. \n\nWe should be covering the jump that you're going to get from 2 series to 5 series. 3 series to 5 series.",

      "Yes, very sorry you’ll have to “hold on” to your 4080S.",

      "$549 was certainly a surprise",

      "I'm ready to be so disappointed by linus tech tips or gamersnexus, watch it be an 18% uplift without the new magical fake frames feature",
      "It feels like this generation is the first true generation of AI prioritized GPUs.  Rasterization is essentially dead. \n\n\nGPUs from here on out will nearly completely rely on AI advancements instead of raw horsepower. This is what a GPU is now.",
      "Literally just murdered AMD’s 9070 before they even announce it lol.\n\nPeople over there were so fucking adamant that no way NVDA would sell the 5070 less than $650 and that the 9070 would undercut it by $50.",
      "Can’t wait for the 5090 and fighting all the bots again ugh",
      "Were any benchmarks shown without frame generation? Also it looks like DLSS4 features are coming to all RTX cards, just not multi-frame gen, which is the least exciting feature imo.",
      "Where are all the doomers saying that the 5080 was going to be at minimum 1500 dollars? Never believe rumored \"leak\" prices everyone. There's no such thing as a confirmed price until jensen walks on stage and says one",
      "Instead of fighting bots. You will be fighting 30+ year old men that smell like New York rats to get your 5090 at Microcenter.",
      "Very happy with the 5070 price point. Was expecting 650-700. Really excited to see reviews and upgrade out of my 2070 super. Pretty much only upgrading because of MH Wilds.",
      "From this imprecise bar graph, Nvidia seems to be saying that a 5090 gets framerates ~30 fps for native 4k path tracing in Cyberpunk, and ~150 fps with performance DLSS + DLSS3 frame generation.\n\nFor comparison, a 4090 gets ~20 fps with native 4k path tracing in Cyberpunk.\n\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-up-to-8x-faster-performance.jpg\n\nEDIT: Typo.",
      "I'm fine with it as long as it looks good. \n\nInsert bell curve meme\n\ndoes it look good? \n\nnooooo the raster performance is only 15% higher and blah blah blah\n\ndoes it look good?",
      "What the actual fuck are these AI benchmarks?  \n  \nFP8 on 40 series but FP4 on 50 series? That's not even remotely a fair comparison. It's not even a comparison at all.",
      "With a 27% increase in power draw... 20% isn't all that great.",
      "Can anyone explain to me if the new DLSS 4 multi frame generation thing still gives you input lag? Has it been improved?",
      "RTX 5090 *starting at* $4039 AUD… get fuuuuuucked.",
      "Lmao obviously not \nOnly with DLSS4 on",
      "The 5090 still has 93 billion transistors over the 76 bil of the 4090 and also has GDDR7 so shouldn’t rely totally on ai for performance improvements",

There were tons of stuff announced. \n\nIf you want to enter the giveaway for a chance to win 3x $20 Steam Giftcard, please respond to this pinned comment for the following questions:\n\n   * Which platform technology or GPU feature are you most excited about from today’s announcement?\n   * Which RTX game are you most looking forward to playing and why?\n\nGiveaway will open until Sunday January 25th at Noon Eastern.",
      "Ok this is a game changer\n\nNvidia basically flipped the table and redid the whole rendering process. All of it\n\nThe Shader pipeline → Neural shader\n\nBVH structure → RTX Mega Geometry\n\nPath tracing RESTIR → Neural Radiance Cache\n\n  \nThey are WAY WAY ahead of competition, omg it hurts.

      "24gb vram though",
      "You got downvoted, but you’re right. The 5080 is not going to match the 4090. It has zero chance. Just look at the cuda core counts and how the 5090 cuda core count scales compared to the 4090. People *really* think a 10k cuda core gpu is gonna match a 16k gpu when a 22k gpu only beats it by 20-30%?\n\nI know cuda core counts arent the end all be all, but we’ve clearly seen based on 5090 reviews that there is no performance uplift with blackwell cuda cores",

This one is now locked due to outdated title.\n\n\\-----\n\n**Update - February 25**\n\n**Full Article Here**: [https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte](https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte)\n\n**NVIDIA's Response Below**:\n\n>*“Upon further investigation, we’ve identified that an* ***early production build of GeForce RTX 5080 GPUs were also affected by the same issue***\\*.\\* ***Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement***\\*,” Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells The Verge.\\*\n\n>*In response to The Verge’s questions, Berraondo adds that “****no other Nvidia GPUs have been affected” — we specifically asked about the upcoming RTX 5070, and he says it’s not affected either. Nor should any cards be affected that were produced more recently: “The production anomaly has been corrected,” he says****. In case you’re wondering, he also told us that* ***Nvidia was not aware of these issues before it launched these GPUs.***\n\n**Here's NVIDIA's Full Amended Statement**:\n\n>*We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.*\n\n\\------------\n\n**Full Article Here**: [https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue](https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue)\n\n**NVIDIA's Response Below**:\n\n>*Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells The Verge*:\n\n>*We have identified* ***a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D and 5070 Ti GPUs*** *which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads.* ***Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement***. The production anomaly has been corrected.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Quick Clarification from me:**\n\nIn the response above, NVIDIA mentioned \"one fewer ROP\". In this case, they are referring to the Raster Operation partition. One (1) Raster Operation partition contains the eight (8) missing ROP units.\n\nAlso, if you want to check your 50 Series cards with [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/), below is the **correct** ROPs amounts from [Blackwell whitepaper](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf):\n\n* **RTX 5090** = 176 ROPs (Affected units have 168 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5080 =** 112 ROPs (Affected units have 104 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** = 96 ROPs (Affected units have 88 ROPs)\n\nWe have also seen [someone](https://reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1iwi18d/rtx_5080_missing_rops/) with 8 missing ROPs on his RTX 5080 as well. While the statement from NVIDIA did not mention RTX 5080, if you do have the same issue with any of the 50 Series cards, the path forward is the same and it is to **contact board manufacturers and** **RMA the card**",

    "selftext": "UPDATE 4: It seems that Nvidia is properly addressing the specific issue I encountered as described below for anyone else who is dealing with it. Mine seems to be an edge case. The more systemic issue appears to be credit card fraud prevention declining peoples' purchases and not providing them with an opportunity to rectify this while returning their already-in-transit GPUs to the sender and not providing the buyer with any opportunity to get back into the Verified Priority Access program. It doesn't have to be like this and Nvidia should seriously consider changing their purchasing process so that this doesn't happen anymore. It can't be cheap for them to ship GPUs out only to pull them back at the last minute.\n\nUPDATE 3: Received my replacement 5090 from Nvidia and all is well. Again, if you somehow encounter a similar issue and your payment has successfully gone through, just make sure to open a support ticket both at Nvidia Marketplace as well as at the normal Nvidia support site, that seems to be what saved me here.\n\nUPDATE 2: Just got off the phone with an escalation manager. He had been aware of my issue for some time and just waited for my refund to process before reaching out. Told me this was the first time he was aware of a situation like mine where FedEx sent back a GPU to them due to damage that they had shipped to a customer and that he'd be happy to process a new order for me. Order was processed and shipped out via overnight, I should have it tomorrow. Told him the support communication was not great up until that point and blamed Digital River but apparently Nvidia does all this marketplace stuff in house now and doesn't deal with them at all, and their support staff is still gathering their bearings. So if you have a similar situation and have a ticket open, just know they do actually look at these things. One thing I'd suggest is to open not only a ticket with the Marketplace support, but also through the main Nvidia Customer Care department and do everything you can to get an escalation.\n\nThanks to the Customer Care department for making this situation right for me!\n\nUPDATE: Not sure if it was a result of this post or not, but I am finally getting proper attention from Nvidia Support now. Should be getting a phone call from their escalation department tomorrow. Thanks to everyone for the upvotes, and hopefully this pans out and gives others in a similar scenario some hope.\n\n\\-----------------\n\nMy purchase went through just fine. It got shipped on 3/5 and I was charged. Package got stuck right before delivery on 3/10. FedEx claims it was damaged and will return to sender. I open a ticket with Nvidia Marketplace support. They claim I will be provided with a replacement RTX 5090. They go silent for days, and the item doesn't move per FedEx tracking. Then my order status disappears from the Nvidia Marketplace. Now I just received an email saying that Nvidia Marketplace is going back on their word and they will be refunding me.\n\nI have no option to get back into the Verified Priority Access program and I have been robbed of my opportunity to purchase a 5090 because FedEx destroyed mine. This sucks. u/NV_Tim bailed on us in the other thread and now I've been screwed out of the 5090 FE I earned through VPA and just because FedEx damaged it.\n\nSupport on 3/17:\n\n>Our team is looking into this, but we did not initiate a refund. Please be assured once we receive the damaged GPU, we will work on a replacement.\n\n>   \nRegards,\n\n> \n\n>Sandra\n\n>**NVIDIA Ecommerce**\n\nSupport on 3/19:\n\n>Your item is still in transit to our warehouse.

    "selftext": "EDIT: By request I tested Mirror's Edge and added the results below\n\nAs the title says, I bought a 3050 as a dedicated PhysX card in order to properly run some older titles that I still very much go back to from time to time. Here are the results in the 4 titles I tested, with screenshots where applicable:\n\nFirstly, proof of the setup:\n\n[Imgur: GPUZ](https://imgur.com/a/NOCaPj6)\n\n**Mafia II Classic results:**\n\nBenchmark run without the 3050 and max settings: **28.8 FPS**\n\nBenchmark run with the 3050 and max settings: **157.1 FPS**\n\nScreenshots: [Imgur: Mafia II](https://imgur.com/a/USHApRq)\n\n**Batman Arkham Asylum results:**\n\nBenchmark run without the 3050 and max settings: **61 FPS** (but with MANY of the scenes in the low 30s and 40s)\n\nBenchmark run with the 3050 and max settings: **390 FPS**\n\nScreenshots: [Imgur: Arkham Asylum](https://imgur.com/a/pSLP1WJ)\n\n**Borderlands 2 results:**\n\n1 minute gameplay run in area with heavy PhysX without the 3050 and max settings: **Could not enable PhysX at ALL**. I tried everything including different legacy versions of PhysX and editing .ini files, all to no avail.\n\n1 minute gameplay run in area with heavy PhysX with the 3050 and max settings: **122 FPS**\n\nNo screenshots for this one since there isn't an in-game benchmark to screengrab, plus the test is very subjective because of that. But at the end of the day, only one setup is even allowing PhysX.\n\n**Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag results:**\n\nPlaythrough of intro without 3050 at max settings: **62 FPS** (engine locked).\n\nPlaythrough of intro with the 3050 at max settings: **also 62 FPS** (engine locked).\n\nIt seemed PhysX wasn't dragging this title down when using the CPU for PhysX. I saw the effects working as pieces of the ship were splintering off into the air as it was being hit by cannon balls.\n\n  \n**Mirror's Edge:**\n\nBreaking a few windows without the 3050: dipped to **12 FPS** and stayed there for 49 seconds as the glass scattered\n\nBreaking the same windows with the 3050: **171 FPS**\n\n**Other notes:**\n\nDespite setting the 3050 as a dedicated PhysX card in the control panel (screenshot below), it doesn't seem to be utilized in any of the 64-bit PhysX games. It seems the games are ignoring the control panel setting and just throwing the PhysX load onto the 5090 anyway. I tried several games and none of them were putting any load onto the 3050 despite PhysX effects being present on-screen. Hopefully this is a bug because I really would have liked to test the difference between running PhysX on the 5090 directly vs offloading it onto the 3050, with modern titles.\n\nScreenshot: [Imgur: Nvidia Control Panel PhysX](https://imgur.com/a/TQiUc30)\n\nThe reason I chose the 3050 6GB is because it isn't cluttering up my case with more power cables as it just runs off the 75W the PCI-E slot provides, and I got a SFF version from Zotac that is a half-length card, so it isn't choking out the 5090 as badly as a full-sized card.\n\nPicture of the setup: [Imgur: My Setup](https://imgur.com/a/LejdX1n)",

      "\\+30% performance for +30% price is pure stagnation, and Nvidia can only do this since it will be the fastest card and halo product. The lower stack looks more promising, as it's no price increase or even slightly lower for a small performance gain.

As of 2025, the industry standard has transitioned to 12V-2X6, replacing the previous 12VHPWR standard. Our new cables incorporate significant advancements, including enhanced terminal and connector housing materials, along with thicker wires, to provide an additional safety buffer for the latest GPUs.\n\n>At MODDIY, all 12VHPWR / 12V-2X6 cables purchased from 2025 onward are manufactured in accordance with the new 12V-2X6 specifications and standards, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance with the RTX50 series GPUs.\n\n>Prior to 2024, the RTX50 series GPUs had not yet been introduced, and the prevailing standard was 12VHPWR. All cables produced before this period were designed and tested for use with the RTX40 series GPUs.\n\n>We recommend that all users upgrade to the new 12V-2X6 cables to take full advantage of the enhanced safety and performance features offered by this new standard.\n\n>You can buy the new 12V-2X6 cable at [ATX 3.1 PCIe 5.1 H++ 12V-2X6 675W 12VHPWR 16 Pin Power Cable](https://www.moddiy.com/products/ATX-3.1-PCIe-5.1-H%252b%252b-12V%252d2X6-675W-12VHPWR-16-Pin-Power-Cable.html).\n\n>**How can I identify if my cable is 12VHPWR or 12V-2X6?**\n\n>To determine the type of cable you have, consider the purchase date:\n\n>If the cable was purchased on or before 2024, it is a 12VHPWR.  \nIf the cable was purchased in 2025 or later, it is a 12V-2X6.\n\n>**Are there no changes in specifications between 12VHPWR and 12V-2X6?**\n\n>Yes, 12VHPWR and 12V-2X6 are fully compatible, and there is no change in cable specifications. However, this does not imply that the cable cannot be improved or enhanced.\n\n>It is a misconception that a product cannot be enhanced, or a new product cannot be released unless there is a change in specifications. This is clearly not the case.\n\n>In the PC industry, every product is continually improving and evolving. New products are introduced regularly, offering better features, superior performance, enhanced durability, improved materials, and more attractive designs, regardless of specification changes.\n\n# Falcon Northwest\n\n[Link to post here](https://x.com/falconnw/status/1889428378769564121?s=46)\n\n>HUGE respect for der8auer's testing, but we're not seeing anything like his setup's results.  \nWe tested ***many*** 5090 Founder's builds with multiple PSU & cable types undergoing days of closed chassis burn-in.  \nTemps (**images in F)** & amperages on all 12 wires are nominal.\n\nGPU Side = 165 °F = 73.89 °C\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bt13u7qm8pie1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=f811da34d31fae20ddbc143f8e9b650b01e88bd8\n\nPSU Side = 157 °F = 69.44 °C\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ulgszdq8pie1.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9b98a2dd4adff345f2440e32f73e25460a98802\n\nCurrent = 7.9A\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3j1n57kljpie1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a21aa050464bed5a9d7d84bd08b6cb703d0bd08\n\n# Jonny-Guru-Gerow (Corsair Head of R&D)\n\n^(Also a legendary PSU reviewer back in 2000s and 2010s)\n\n[Link to Reddit Account here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jonny-Guru-Gerow/)\n\nSome relevant comments:\n\n>It's a misunderstanding on MODDIY's end. Clearly they're not a member of the PCI-SIG and haven't read through the spec. Because the spec clearly states that the changes made that differentiate 12VHPWR from 12V-2x6 is made only on the connector on the GPU and the PSU (if applicable).\n\n>My best guess of this melted cable comes down to one of several QC issues. Bad crimp. Terminal not fully seated. That kind of thing. Derau8er already pointed out the issue with using mixed metals, but I didn't see any galvanic corrosion on the terminal. Doesn't mean it's not there. There's really zero tolerance with this connector, so even a little bit of GC could potentially cause enough resistance to cause failure. Who knows? I don't have the cable in my hands. :D\n\n\\------\n\n>The MODDIY was not thicker gauge than the Nvidia. They're both 16g. Just the MODDIY cable had a thicker insulation.\n\n\\------\n\n>That's wrong. Then again, that video is full of wrong (sadly. Not being like Steve and looking to beat up on people, but if the wire was moving 22A and was 130°C, it would have melted instantly.)\n\n>16g is the spec and the 12VHPWR connector only supports 16g wire. In fact, the reason why some mod shops sell 17g wire is because some people have problems putting paracord sleeve over a 16g wire and getting a good crimp. That extra mm going from16g to 17g is enough to allow the sleeve to fit better. But that's not spec. Paracord sleeves aren't spec. The spec is 16g wire. PERIOD.\n\n\\------\n\n>If it was that hot, he wouldn't be able to hold it in his hand. I don't know what his IR camera was measuring, but as Aris pointed out.... that wire would've melted. I've melted wires with a lot less current than that.\n\n>Also, the fact that the temperature at the PSU is hotter than the GPU is completely backwards from everything I've ever tested. And I've tested a lot. Right now I have a 5090 running Furmark 2 for an hour so far and I have 46.5°C at the PSU and 64.2°C at the GPU in a 30°C room. The card is using 575.7W on average.\n\n>Derau8er is smart. Hr'll figure things out sooner than later. I just think his video was too quick and dirty. Proper testing would be to move those connectors around the PSU interface. Unplug and replug and try again. Try another cable. At the very least, take all measurements at least twice. He's got everyone in an uproar and it's really all for nothing. Not saying there is no problem. I personally don't \\*like\\* the connector, but we don't have enough information right now and shouldn't be basing assumptions on some third party cable from some Hong Kong outfit.\n\n\\------\n\n>ABSOLUTELY. There is no argument that there is going to be different resistance across different pins. But no wire/terminal should get hotter than 105°C. We're CLEARLY seeing a problem where terminals are either not properly crimped, inserted, corroded, etc. what have you, and the power is going to a path of less resistance. But this is a design problem. I can't fix this. :-( (well... I can, maybe, but it requires overcomplicating the cable and breaking the spec)\n\n\\------\n\n>They provide this if your PSU is not capable of more than 150W per 8-pin. If used with a PSU that CAN provide more than 150W per 8-pin, it just splits the load up across the four connections\n\n>There is no \"6+2-pin to 12VHPWR\". The cable is a 2x4-pin Type 4 or 5 to 12V-2x6. There is no disadvantage to using this as the 12VHPWR has 6 12V conductors and 6 grounds and two sense that need to be grounded. 2x Type 4 connection gives you up to 8x 12V and 8x ground. So, this is a non-issue.\n\n>12VHPWR to 12VHPWR is fine too. Just like the 2x Type 4 8-pin or 2x Type 5 8-pin, you have a one-to-one connection between the PSU and the GPU. That' s why I don't like calling these cables \"adapters\". If it's one-to-one, it's not an adapter. It's just a \"cable\".\n\n\\------\n\n>The 8-pin PCIe is rated for 150W on the GPU side. The actual cable and connectors' rating is dependant on the materials used.\n\n>The 150W part came from the assumption that the worst case materials are used. Things like 20g wire. Phosphor bronze terminals. In most cases today, a single 8-pin (which is actually effectively only 6-pin since 2 of the pins are \"sense\" wires) can easily handle 300W each.\n\n\\------\n\n>So, as an update... I intentionally damaged a terminal (shoved a screwdriver in it and twisted), am getting < 1A on it and the others are over 10A. Not 20A, though. Which, if der8auers numbers are accurate, means the cable has MULTIPLE faults. Which may actually be the case. But I think he would have noticed that and called that out. \\*shrug\\* I hope he posts an update. He's more than welcome to reach out to me for a unlimited supply of cables. :D\n\n# Wendell - Level1Techs\n\n[Link to post here](https://x.com/tekwendell/status/1889431981425041691)\n\n>I've been testing with the FE 5090 w/ 550w+  in and out of the tiki and haven't had anything alarming for cable heating yet fwiw.

If something goes wrong, then at most it is the cable and connector. Two plugs, four results? It’s not quite that extreme, but another cable change shows: The values change slightly each time they are plugged in, which indicates the general deficiencies of the plug connection (clamping surface, contact). Added to this is the voltage drop, which also depends on chance.\n\n>The shortcomings of the 12VHPWR connector, in particular the uneven current distribution through the cable and connector, can cause unbalanced loads where individual pins are loaded more than others. These local overloads lead to increased contact resistance and heat generation, which under certain conditions can cause thermal damage to contacts and cables. In addition, by dispensing with active balancing and splitting the power supply across several rails in the board topology, NVIDIA has itself abandoned possible protective and corrective measures. As the cards directly take over the faulty distribution of the input side, the power load remains uncontrolled, which can lead to escalation under the wrong conditions.\n\n>This situation shows how several factors can interact: The inadequate plug connection as a starting point, the resulting thermal issues as a potential symptom, and the lack of protection measures on the board as an untapped opportunity to remedy the situation. Although such problems do not necessarily have to occur, the system remains susceptible to this concatenation if the load and the external conditions coincide unfavorably\n\n>The symptoms of melting contacts and overheated cables in modern GPUs can be explained as a chain of unfortunate circumstances that do not necessarily have to occur. On the contrary, it will probably remain the exception. But it can happen\n\n# OC3D\n\nVideo - [Link Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3BXarPl1F0)\n\nArticle - [Link Here](https://overclock3d.net/reviews/gpu_displays/asus-saved-our-bacon-we-had-12vhpwr-12v-2x6-cable-issues/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qtucj5qyyie1.png?width=3598&format=png&auto=webp&s=a06d4dabbd26e0e02ac4e21b8310de7d99a53f6e\n\n>While testing ASUS’ ROG Astral RTX 5090 LC GPU, we uncovered a startling problem. **Despite correctly/fully inserting our 16-pin GPU power cable, several of our GPU’s voltage pins had red indicators. Power was being unevenly pulled through our power connectors**.\n\n>**After repeatedly reseating our cables, we found that at least one light remained red**. While **we could get all lights to be green with careful manipulation, we clearly had a problem**. More shockingly, this problem would not have been noticed without ASUS’ “Power Detector” feature. Had we not been reviewing this specific graphics card, this problem would never have been noticed.\n\n>**All lights were green when we switched to a new 12V-2×6 power cable. Only our hard-used 16-pin power cables had issues. This implies that general wear and tear could make the difference between a safe and a dangerous power cable**. However, we must note that we have been using the same 16-pin power cables for years of GPU testing, making our cables incredibly well-worn.\n\n>**Today, we learned that worn/used 16-pin GPU power cables can have uneven power distribution across the cable**. Potentially, this can lead to dangerous amounts of power going through specific voltage pins. **To be frank, the OC3D GPU test system was on the road to disaster. Our cables were used to test a huge number of graphics cards, and that wear adds up. While we don’t expect many other PC builders to use/abuse their 16-pin cables as much as we do, cable wear is a factor that PC builders must consider. The safety margins of the 12V-2×6/12VHPWR standard are too low for us to simply ignore this issue.**\n\n>From now on, 16-pin GPU power cables will be considered by us as a consumable item. To help avoid issues, we will be replacing our cables regularly to help prevent catastrophic issues.\n\n>**For consumers, our recommendation is clear. When you buy a power-hungry GPU, consider buying a new 16-pin power cable.** **If you bought a new PSU with your GPU, you won’t need a new cable. However, if you plan to reuse your power supply, a new 12V-2×6 cable could save your bacon**. A lot of PSU manufacturers sell replacement 12V-2×6 cables, and many good 3rd party options are available (like those from **CableMod**).\n\n>With high-wattage GPUs costing £1,000+, purchasing a £20-30 cable is a worthy investment for those who want some extra peace of mind. It’s just a shame that such considerations are necessary.\n\n# Jayz2Cents\n\nVideo - [I inserted these cables over 100 times!

Not only did the Nvidia made the GPU and power management worse from the early version, they increased the max power drawn, but didn't increase the cables/connectors or overall GPU VRM.\n\nSafety is by far the number one thing for me personally, since the GPU often runs 24/7. I simply can't trust the GPU, even after undervolting. There need to be around 2x safety margins… Period!

I was willing to take any 5090 I could find but, was hoping to get a Tuf so was over the moon to actually get the card I was hoping to get. This is for sure my favorite AIB design. \n\nMy 5090 buying strategy - Join a discord that tracks restocks, get the InStock or Hot Stock app. Best Buy releases restocks in batches. As soon as you see the first notification, if you aren’t able to get in line, just keep the webpage for that card open. As soon as you get another restock notification refresh the page and spam the “add to cart” button. Once you clear the line, the item will be added to your cart after you verify yourself which holds the item and allows you 10 min to check out (this is actually gives you a chance against the bots). From there you have time to get your wallet and actually comprehend your checkout without racing through it. This is how I was able to get my card.

it may therefore be disputed through other channels;\n\n>**Point 5:** It is true that no exclusions are indicated, and in fact in America even FE cards benefit from this code – in our region, NVIDIA does not provide this promotion because it does not sell products directly but through LDLC, which is a vendor like any other and does not participate in this promotion in Italy – this too is the response of those with expertise on the matter, and therefore cannot be contested via this channel;\n\n>**Point 6:** In Italy, LDLC is the only one selling Founders Editions, whereas in other countries the Founders Editions are sold by other companies; in Europe, it is not possible to purchase directly from the NVIDIA store and one must go through these resellers; in America, it is possible to purchase directly from the NVIDIA store – if you look on the LDLC website, you will not find Founders Editions listed, so the response from LDLC customer service stating “only for customers who placed an order on the LDLC France site” refers to custom cards, not Founders Editions.\n\n>That said, I understand why you insist, but I reiterate that this information/these responses are final as they come from the competent department.\n\n>Therefore, they cannot be contested through this communication channel, but you may dispute them through consumer protection agencies or other means.\n\n# Here's my answer:\n\n>Thank you for your response, but I cannot accept what you wrote as “definitive,” because it contains several statements contradicted by the official Terms and Conditions and by the information published on NVIDIA’s Italian website. Below I reply point by point:\n\n**01. The existence of the promo page does not prove that FE cards are included**\n\n>Correct: nowhere is it stated that FE cards are included.  \nBut it is also **nowhere stated that they are excluded**. The terms clearly state:\n\n>“Offer valid for desktop systems or NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, 5070 graphics cards…”\n\n>The Founders Edition **is** an RTX 5070. If there were any exclusions, they should have been listed. The absence of such an exclusion is meaningful.\n\n>Moreover, on the product page of the NVIDIA Marketplace, the RTX 5070 Founders Edition displayed the **“DOOM INCLUDED”** banner.\n\n**02. The T&Cs only mention the territory, not the inclusion of FE cards**\n\n>Exactly: they neither exclude nor mention FE cards, but **explicitly include Europe**.\n\n>The fact that the promotion is “valid in Europe at authorized partners and resellers” implies that purchases made in Europe from such partners (like LDLC) are eligible.\n\n**03. Not all partners participate, and LDLC is not listed at the bottom of the page**\n\n>But the page **does not exclude LDLC** — it simply does not mention it among the resellers in the United States and Canada (the list is clearly for the North American region).\n\n>Additionally:\n\n>My card was purchased through the **Italian NVIDIA Marketplace**, **not directly from LDLC’s website**.\n\n>The **“DOOM included”** banner was visible on the RTX 5070 product page at the time of purchase.\n\n>This is official promotional material, **not a mistake**.\n\n>\n\n>**04. The banner is present, but not related to EMEA**\n\n>This is a very serious statement:\n\n>The banner is on the **Italian NVIDIA Marketplace**, not the American one.\n\n>The website was **localized in Italian** and included the phrase “DOOM incluso”.\n\n>So NVIDIA **advertised the promotion in Italy, in the Italian language, on a site aimed at the Italian public**, and now claims that the promotion does not apply in this country.\n\n>This is, in effect, **misleading advertising**.\n\n>\n\n>**05. In the U.S. FE cards are included, in Europe they are not**\n\n>Once again:\n\n>If FE cards are excluded in Europe, this **must be stated in the T&Cs**.\n\n>If FE cards are excluded in Europe, they **should not have a banner** indicating they are part of the promotion.\n\n>There is **no clause** that limits the offer to “custom” cards.\n\n>Stating that the promotion applies in the U.S. but not in Europe, without this distinction being reflected in the official documents, **exposes NVIDIA to legal responsibility**.\n\n>\n\n>**06. FE cards in Europe are not sold directly by NVIDIA, so they are not valid**\n\n>But I did **not** purchase from LDLC.\n\n>I purchased from the **Italian NVIDIA website**.\n\n>And on that site, the **“DOOM included”** banner was present.\n\n>The fact that NVIDIA relies on LDLC for order fulfillment **does not change the nature of the offer made to the consumer**.\n\n>\n\n>**Conclusion**\n\n>The fact that you keep stating that the response is “not open to dispute” **does not make the claim correct**, nor does it negate the responsibilities that arise from misleading advertising. I will therefore proceed with a **report to AGCM** (the Italian Competition and Market Authority), and if necessary, to the **European Consumer Centre**.\n\n>I remain available in case NVIDIA decides to resolve this issue amicably.\n\n# And again, NVIDIA's response\n\n>\n\nI kindly ask you not to misuse this support service.\n\n>As I have already explained, this is not the appropriate channel to dispute this matter.\n\n>Therefore, I ask you not to proceed any further in this way, as your messages amount to venting dissatisfaction to people who are no longer in a position to help you – and that is not the purpose of my job.\n\n>The information I have provided to you is final, and there is no room to contest it through this channel.\n\n>Again, I ask you not to abuse the service being offered to you.\n\n>If you wish to confirm what I have told you, you may contact the channels I’ve already provided:\n\n>[info@nvidia.com](mailto:info@nvidia.com)\n\n>[https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/support/consumer/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/support/consumer/)\n\n>Thank you again for your understanding, and I hope you take into consideration what I have written.\n\n>This case is now considered closed.",

The reason is that an NVIDIA GPU can push power, but they're voltage limited, so you're pulling more power for no reason.\n\nEven Der8uer has OC'd and manually modified a 4090 card with an EC2 to push past the 1.1V limit and also power modded the 4090 by shunt modding it, in the end I think he gained like 5% more performance but the power was like 900W.

    "selftext": "# GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition reviews are up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3568lwrnwqee1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30ca4f255f94899838a70ab1168949437d3e03fd\n\n# Below is the compilation of all the reviews that have been posted so far. I will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links. This will be sorted alphabetically.\n\n# Written Articles\n\n# [Babeltechreviews](https://babeltechreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)\n\n>For the Blackwell RTX 50 series launch, NVIDIA strategically chose to introduce their flagship model first, launching the GeForce RTX 5090 ahead of other models to set a high benchmark in performance. Following this release, other models like the RTX 5080 and RTX 5070 are set to be launched, all of which we assume will also be impressive with DLSS 4 and their new design. The RTX 5090 remains the pinnacle in terms of raw power and capabilities and is in a class of its own, alongside its high price tag.\n\n>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition’s powerful performance make it an essential upgrade for enthusiasts and professionals aiming to push the limits of what’s possible in their digital environments. Purists will not enjoy DLSS 4 and will want a much larger raw performance jump, but for those that do the performance uplift will make you drop your jaw just like it did to ours. We remember titles like Hogwarts Legacy having performance issues at launch and with DLSS 4 enabled we saw incredibly high gains of 301.6 AI generated FPS performance difference over its raw power. Nothing can replace proper optimization but expanding the capabilities of a game to perform in such large amounts is amazing.\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk3fECI-fmw)\n\n>Going into this review, it was clear that there was some trepidation that the RTX 5090 wouldn't offer enough of a performance advantage over its predecessor when it comes to raw frame-rates, ie without the multi frame generation tech that Nvidia leaned heavily on in its pre-release marketing. These are justifiable concerns - after all, there's no die shrink to accompany this generation of processors, and pushing more power can only get you so far.\n\n>Thankfully - for those that want to justify upgrading to a $2000+ graphics card - the beefier design and faster GDDR7 memory do deliver sizeable gains over the outgoing 4090 flagship, measured at around 31 percent on average at 4K. The differentials are understandably smaller when you look at lower resolutions - just 17 percent at 1080p, though anyone considering the 5090 is probably unlikely to be rocking a 1080p display. Nvidia, Intel, AMD and Sony have all spoken about the slowing progress in terms of silicon price to performance, and we can see why all four companies are now [looking to machine learning](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-ps5-pro-tech-interview-with-mark-cerny-and-mike-fitzgerald) technologies to shore up generational advancements.\n\n>Speaking of which, DLSS 4's multi frame generation is an effective tool for pushing frame-rates - though arguably not *performance* to higher levels. On the RTX 5090, it's best used along similarly high-end 4K 144Hz+ monitors, so it's no surprise that Nvidia and its partners ensured that reviewers had access to 4K 240Hz screens for their testing. If you're lucky enough to be in that situation, you can use MFG to essentially max out your monitor's refresh rate, with a choice of 1x, 2x or 3x frame generation.\n\n>There's of course a trade-off in terms of latency, but it's smaller than you might think - and once you've already enabled frame generation, knocking it up an extra level has only a small impact on thos latency figures. For example, in [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077) with RT Overdrive (path tracing), we saw frame-rates go with 94.5fps with DLSS upscaling to 286fps when adding 4x multi frame generation, a \\~3x multiplier at the cost of \\~9ms of added latency (26ms vs 35ms). If you have a 4K 240Hz monitor, that might be a trade worth taking - and of course, you're more than free to ignore frame generation and knock back other settings instead to get performance to a level you're happy with.\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/review-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-reference-edition/)\n\n>The RTX 5090 features an advanced rendering engine that pushes past previous limits with the help of its  21,760 CUDA cores. This means smoother and faster gameplay with more realistic environments, creating an immersive experience. The RTX 50 series introduced a new generation of Ray tracing and Tensor cores. These aren’t just numbers on a spec sheet – they represent a leap in efficiency and power. Located close to the shader engine, these cores work tirelessly to deliver distinctive outputs. Even though Tensor cores can be tricky to measure, their impact is unmistakable, especially when paired with DLSS3.5 and new DLSS4 with MFG  technology that delivers impressive results. The GeForce RTX 5090 is not just an enthusiast-class card; it's a versatile powerhouse. Whether playing games at 2K (2560x1440) or better yet, game at 4K (3840x2160), it offers superlative performance at every resolution. This makes it an outstanding choice for gamers who seek both quality and speed, transporting them into new realms of interactive entertainment\n\n>Depending on the game title this value can greatly differ! However, on average you're looking at 25% maybe 30% more traditional rendering performance. The thing is though, NVIDIA has invested a lot of the transistor budget into AI, Deeplearning and Neural shading. We've presented the numbers with DLSS4 and when you enable frame generation mode at 4x, the performance is astounding. The reality is that we are reaching physical limits where traditional methods of increasing performance are becoming harder than ever. Chips would have to grow even larger, power consumption would skyrocket, and costs would soar. Imagine a future where every attempt to push technology further leads to larger, more power-hungry chips that become increasingly expensive. As we encounter these boundaries, think creatively and seek new solutions. Instead of following a path that leads to dead ends, this challenge invites us to innovate and discover groundbreaking ideas such as DLSS4 and MFG.\n\n>If you factor out pricing and energy consumption, it's gonna be hard to not be impressed with the GeForce RTX 5090. The card drips and oozes performance and it all packs into a two-slot form factor. On the traditional shader rasterizer part, it's still a good notch faster than RTX 4090, however, if you are savvy with technologies like DLSS4 offers, the sky is the limit. We do hope to see more backwards compatibility with DLSS 4 so that older games will get this new tech included as well. DLSS4 is not perfect though, yes butter smooth, but in Alan Wake 2 for example the scene rendered was fantastic but we; see birds flying over in the sky leaving a weird hale trail. The scene was otherwise very nice though.  The Blackwell GPU architecture of the 5090 demonstrates proficient performance. It boasts about 1.25 to sometimes 1.50 times the raw shader performance compared to its predecessor, along with enhanced Raytracing and Tensor core capabilities.\n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review)\n\n>NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090 is the fastest, most powerful, and feature-rich consumer GPU in the world as of today, period. There’s no other way to put it. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition card itself is also a refined piece of hardware. To design a card that offers significantly more performance than an RTX 4090, at much higher power levels, in a roughly 33% smaller form factor is no small feat of engineering. The card also looks great in our opinion. On its own, the GeForce RTX 5090 is currently unmatched in the consumer GPU market – nothing can touch it in terms of performance, with virtually any workload – AI, content creation, gaming, you name it.\n\n>It's not all sunshine and rainbows, though. In many cases, the GeForce RTX 5090 offered nearly double the performance of its predecessor (RTX 3090) when it debuted, at lower power, while using the exact same settings and workloads. If you compare the GeForce RTX 5090 to the RTX 4090 at like settings, however, the RTX 5090 is “only” about 25% - 40% faster and consumes more power. The RTX 5090’s $1,999 MSRP is also significantly higher than the 4090’s $1,599 price tag. Considering the Ada and [Blackwell GPUs](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-architecture-overview) at play here are manufactured on the same TSMC process node, NVIDIA was still able to move the needle considerably, but the GeForce RTX 5090 doesn’t represent the same kind of monumental leap the RTX 4090 did when it launched, if you disregard its new rendering technologies at least.\n\n>You can’t disregard those new capabilities, though. Neural Rendering, DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, the updated media engine, and all that additional memory and memory bandwidth all have to be taken into consideration. When playing a game that can leverage Blackwell’s new features, the GeForce RTX 5090 can indeed be more than twice as fast as [the RTX 4090](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-gpu-review).\n\n>The use of frame generation has spurred much discussion since its introduction, and we understand the concerns regarding input latency and potential visual artifacts that come from using frame-gen. But the fact remains, using AI and machine learning to boost game and graphics performance in the most effective and efficient way forward at this time. Moving to more advanced manufacturing process nodes doesn’t offer the kind of power, performance and area benefits it once did, so boosting performance must ultimately come mostly from architectural and feature updates. And everyone in the PC graphics game is turning to AI. We specifically asked about the importance of traditional rasterization moving forward and were told development is still happening, and it will remain necessary for “ground truth” rendering to train the models, but ultimately AI will be generating more and more frames in the future.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review-the-600-watt-powerhouse-in-gaming-and-lab-tests/)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5090 delivered impressive results in practical tests. The card achieved significantly higher frame rates in Full HD, WQHD and Ultra HD compared to the RTX 4090, especially with DLSS and ray tracing support enabled. The multi-frame generation enables consistent frame pacing and reduces noticeable latency, which is particularly beneficial in fast and dynamic gaming scenarios. The improvements in patch tracing and ray tracing ensure a more realistic representation of complex scenes. Games such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2 visibly benefit from the technological advances and show that the Blackwell architecture has the potential to smoothly display the most demanding graphic effects.\n\n>The image quality achieved by the Transformer models in DLSS 4 is another important aspect. Where previously a clear trade-off had to be made between performance and quality, DLSS 4 combines both in an impressive way. Most notably, the new Performance setting offers almost the same visual quality as previous Quality modes. This is achieved through advanced AI-powered models that capture both local details and global relationships to produce a near-native image representation. The smooth and detailed rendering at significantly higher frame rates shows that DLSS 4 is an essential part of the RTX 5090, further underlining its performance. There will be a detailed practical test on this from our monitor professional Fritz Hunter.\n\n>In my opinion, the GeForce RTX 5090 is an impressive graphics card that shows just how far GPU technology has come. The new features in particular, such as DLSS 4 and Transformer-supported image optimization, set new standards. The performance of this card is simply breathtaking, be it in games in Ultra HD with active patch tracing or in demanding AI-supported applications. It is remarkable how NVIDIA has managed to find the balance between graphical excellence and innovative technologies. Another outstanding aspect is the ability of DLSS 4 to achieve an image quality that is almost indistinguishable from native resolutions, while at the same time increasing performance. The change from “Quality” to “Performance” as a standard option is like a revolution in the way we perceive image enhancement. The smooth display, combined with an incredible level of detail, takes the gaming experience to a new level.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-ray-tracing-dlss-4-and-raw-power-explored/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wEXrZSnsRM)\n\n>Much was made of the performance ahead of launch, people were breaking out rulers and [pixel counting Nvidia's bar charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1hvvrqj/50_vs_40_series_nvidia_benchmark_exact_numbers/), but after thorough testing today we can confirm native rendering performance has increased in the ballpark of 30% over the RTX 4090 when testing at 4K. That makes the RTX 5090 64% faster on average compared to AMD's current consumer flagship, the RX 7900 XTX, while it's also a 71% uplift over the RTX 4080 Super. Ray tracing also scales similarly, given we saw the exact same 29% margin over the RTX 4090 in the eight RT titles we tested.\n\n>Those are the sort of performance increases you can expect at 4K, but the uplift does get progressively smaller as resolution decreases. Versus the RTX 4090, for instance, we saw smaller gains of 22% at 1440p and 18% at 1080p. Now, I don't expect many people will be gaming at native 1080p on an RTX 5090, but it's worth bearing that in mind if you'd typically game with DLSS Super Resolution. After all, using its performance mode at 4K utilises a 1080p internal render resolution. Clearly this is a card designed for 4K – and perhaps even above – but that performance scaling at lower resolutions could be something to bear in mind.\n\n>Of course, whether or not you are impressed by those generational gains depends entirely on your perspective – an extra 30% over the 4090 could sound great, or it could be a disappointment. The main thing from my perspective as a reviewer is to give you, the reader, as much information as possible to allow you to make an informed decision, and I think I have done that today.\n\n>Gamers do get the extra value add of DLSS 4, specifically Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is a new feature exclusive to the RTX 50-series. I spent a fair bit of time testing MFG as part of this review and I think if you already got on with Frame Generation on the RX 40-series, you'll probably find a lot to like with MFG. It's been particularly useful in enabling 4K/240Hz gaming experiences that wouldn't otherwise be possible – such as high frame rate path tracing in Cyberpunk 2077 – and with the growing [4K OLED monitor segment](https://www.kitguru.net/components/matthew-wilson/ces-2025-leo-gets-a-closer-look-at-new-msi-oled-monitors-dual-system-case-and-more/), that's certainly good news.\n\n>However, it's definitely not a perfect technology as the discerning gamer will still notice some fizzling or shimmering that isn't otherwise there, while latency scaling is still backwards compared to what we've come to expect – in the sense that latency actually *increases* as frame rate increases with MFG, rather than latency decreasing. That means some will find it problematic as the *feel* doesn't always match up to the visual fluidity of the increased frame rate.\n\n>It is great to see Nvidia is improving other aspects of DLSS, though, with its new Transformer-based models of Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. Not only do these improve things like ghosting and overall level of detail compared to the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, but this upgrade actually applies to *all* RTX GPUs, right the way back to the 20-series. There's even a possibility that Multi Frame Gen [might come to older cards](https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/joao-silva/nvidia-multi-frame-generation-could-come-to-rtx-30-series-gpus/) given that Nvidia hasn't explicitly ruled it out, but personally I'd be surprised to see that happen given it currently acts as an incentive to upgrade to the latest and greatest.\n\n>We can't end this review without a discussion of Nvidia's Founders Edition design, either. This is a *highly* impressive feat of engineering, considering it's a mere dual-slot thickness yet it is able to comfortably tame 575W of power. We saw the GPU settling at 72C during a thirty-minute 4K stress test, while the VRAM hit 88C, which is slightly warmer but still well within safe limits. I love to see the innovation in this department, as when pretty much every AIB partner is slapping quad-slot coolers onto their 5090s, this is a refreshing step back to a time when GPUs didn't cover the entire bottom-half of your motherboard.\n\n# [LanOC](https://lanoc.org/review/video-cards/9132-nvidia-rtx-5090-founders-edition)\n\n>Performance for the new generation of cards in my testing had the RTX 5090 outperforming the RTX 4090 by around 32% which is right in line with the increase in CUDA cores for the card. There were some tests which saw an even bigger increase and the RTX 5090 was at the top of the chart across the board in every applicable test. What was even more impressive to me was the improvements with DLSS 4, the performance difference that it can make is sometimes shocking, but on top of that Nvidia has improved the smoothness and picture quality. At the end of the day, there wasn’t anything that I threw at the RTX 5090 that slowed it down, but if you do run into something that it can’t handle DLSS 4 is going to fix you right up. I did see some bugs in my DLSS testing, mostly when trying down resolutions, but I suspect some of those will be smoothed out once the updates are released. The biggest issue I ran into performance-wise was that a few of our benchmarks just wouldn’t run at all and they were all OpenCL. Nvidia is aware and is working to get support for those tests.\n\n>The big increase in performance without any change in manufacturing size does have the RTX 5090 having a significantly higher power consumption. I saw it pulling up to 648 watts at peak, combine that with today's highest-end CPUs and we are swinging back to needing high-wattage power supplies. Speaking of power, the power connection has been improved in a whole list of ways including moving from the original 12VHPWR connection to the changed design that is called 12V-2-6. It looks the same and all of the power supplies will still connect. But they have changed the pin heights to get a better connection and the sense pins are shorter and are more likely to catch when the plug isn’t connected all the way. On top of that Nvidia’s card design has recessed the connection down into the card and angled it to reduce any strain on the connection. They have also included a much nicer power adapter as well. All of that power does mean there is more heat but the double blow-through design handled it surprisingly well running similarly in temperatures to the RTX 4090 Founders Edition even with a thinner card design and a lot more wattage going through.\n\n# [OC3D Article](https://overclock3d.net/reviews/gpu_displays/nvidia-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oDxME5APa8)\n\n>Speaking of DLSS 4, that comes with the big ticket item in the Blackwell release, Multi Frame Generation. By refining the algorithm, and giving the card newer generations of hardware, the RTX 5090 can now generate three extra frames from a single frame rendered. As you could see from our results in Alan Wake II, Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, the effect is considerable. Cyberpunk 2077, with an open world, neon soaked, usually wet and thus reflective environment is about as good as games can look. Turn on path-tracing and it’s nearly real life. That path-tracing has a massive performance cost though. On the RTX 4090 you get 133 FPS @ 4K without it, 40 FPS with it.\n\n>Even turning DLSS and Frame Gen on doesn’t recoup all that, maxing out at 104. Click through the Multi Frame Gen settings on the RTX 5090 though and that number hits 241 FPS. With, and we cannot state this enough, NO loss in visual fidelity. That’s Cyberpunk at 4K with pathed ray-tracing turned on and a frame rate you’d require a very expensive monitor (4K@240Hz!) to appreciate fully. When CD Projekt Red’s Magnum Opus first appeared you could get smoother frame rates from a flipbook.\n\n>All of which returns us to the way we’ve tested how we have. Because in regular mode, with DLSS turned on and, at most, a single frame generated as is currently the way, the RTX 5090 is another big step forwards on the best of the current cards. Anything which can stomp on a RTX 4090 is crazy good. That the RTX 5090 Founders Edition can do that, and then has much further to go with the benefits of MFG, makes any claims about it being a purely software-based improvement look as ill-informed as they do.\n\n>Already that’s more than enough to make the Nvidia RTX 5090 Founders Edition a Day One recommendation to anyone serious about their gaming. We haven’t even mentioned the crazy low latencies – and thus higher KD ratio – of the upgraded Reflex 2 technology. Or RTX Neural Faces that can convert a 2D picture into a 3D character. We’ve not discussed, because it’s embryonic, the potential of the AI powered NPCs with the Nvidia Ace technology. Or the extra broadcast features, faster encoding and decoding, and all the AI calculation benefits having this much power at your disposal can bring.\n\n>Simply put, the Nvidia RTX 5090 has coalesced all the current thinking on AI, performance, sharpness, and generative content into a single card that blows the doors off anything on the market. It’s the future, today.\n\n# [PC Perspective](https://pcper.com/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)\n\n>Well, NVIDIA has topped NVIDIA. Once again, and with zero competition at the high end, GeForce reigns supreme. And while raster performance has risen, DLSS 4 is the star of the show with the RTX 50 Series, now supporting up to ***four*** generated frames per rendered frame (!) if you dare. Yes, the price for NVIDIA’s flagship has risen again, from $1599 to $1999 this generation, but those who want the fastest graphics card in the world will surely buy it anyway.\n\n# [PC World Article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J5wDq2ba2E)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 4090 stood unopposed as the ultimate gaming GPU since the moment it launched. No longer. The new Blackwell generation uses the same underlying TSMC 4N process technology as the RTX 40-series, so Nvidia couldn’t squeeze easy improvements there. Instead, the company overhauled the RTX 5090’s instruction pipeline, endowed it with 33 percent more CUDA cores, and pushed it to a staggering 575W TGP, up from the 4090’s 450W. Blackwell also introduced a new generation of RT and AI cores.\n\n>Add it all up and the RTX 5090 is an unparalleled gaming beast — though the effects hit different depending on whether or not you’re using RTX features like ray tracing and DLSS.\n\n>In games that *don’t* use ray tracing or DLSS, simply brute force graphics rendering, the RTX 5090 isn’t much more than a mild generational performance upgrade. It runs an average of 27 percent faster in those games — but the splits swing wildly depending on the game: *Cyberpunk 2077* is 50 percent faster, *Shadow of the Tomb Raider* is 32 percent faster, and *Rainbox Six Siege* is 28 percent faster, but *Assassin’s Creed Valhalla* and *Call of Duty: Black Ops 6* only pick up 15 and 12 percent more performance, respectively.\n\n>Much like DLSS, DLSS 2, and DLSS 3 before it, the [new DLSS 4 generation](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&xs=1&url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/&xcust=2-1-2585806-1-0-0-0-0&sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html) is an absolute game-changer. Nvidia’s boundary-pushing AI tech continues to look better, run faster, and now *feel* smoother. It’s insane.\n\n>Nvidia made two monumental changes to DLSS to coincide with the RTX 50-series release. First, all DLSS games will be switching to a new “Transformer” model from the older “Convolutional Neural Network” behind the scenes, on all RTX GPUs going back to the 20-series.\n\n>More crucially for the RTX 5090 (and future 50-series offerings), DLSS 4 adds a new Multi Frame Generation technology, building upon the success of [DLSS 3 Frame Gen](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html). While DLSS 3 uses tensor cores to insert a single AI-generated frame between GPU-rendered frames, supercharging performance, MFG inserts *three* AI frames between each GPU-rendered frame (which itself may only be rendering an image at quarter resolution, then using DLSS Super Resolution to upscale that to fit your screen).\n\n>Bottom line: DLSS 4 is a stunning upgrade you *must* play around with to fully appreciate its benefits. It’s literally a game-changer, once again — though we’ll have to see if it feels *this* sublime on lower-end Nvidia cards like the more affordable RTX 5070.\n\n>In a vacuum, the RTX 5090 delivers around a 30 percent average boost in gaming performance over the RTX 4090. That’s a solid generational improvement, but one we’ve seen throughout history delivered at the same price point as the older, slower outgoing hardware. Nvidia asking for an extra $500 on top seems garish and overblown from that perspective.\n\n>While I wouldn’t recommend upgrading to this over the RTX 4090 for gaming (unless you’re giddy to try DLSS 4), it’s a definite upgrade option for the RTX 3090 and anything older. The 4090 was 55 to 83 percent faster than the 3090 in games, and the 5090 is about 30 percent faster than *that*, with gobs more memory.\n\n>At the end of the day, nobody needs a $2,000 graphics card to play games. But if you *want* one and don’t mind the sticker price, this is easily the most powerful, capable graphics card ever released. The GeForce RTX 5090 is a performance monster supercharged by DLSS 4’s see-it-to-believe it magic.\n\n# [Puget Systems (Content Creation Review)](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-content-creation-review/)\n\n>Overall, the RTX 5090 is a beast of a card. Drawing 575 W, with 32 GB VRAM and a $2000 price tag (at least), it is overkill for many use cases. However, it excels at GPU-heavy workloads like rendering and provides solid performance improvements over the last-gen 4090 in many applications. There are some issues with software compatibility that need to be worked out, but historically, NVIDIA has been great about ensuring its products are properly supported throughout the software ecosystem.\n\n>For **video editing and motion graphics**, the RTX 5090 performs well, with 10-20% improvements across the board. In particular sub-tests, where the workload is primarily GPU bound, we see up to 35% performance advantages over the previous-generation 4090. However, the area we are most excited about is actually the enhanced codec support for the NVENC/NVDEC engines. In DaVinci Resolve, the H.265 4:2:2 10-bit processing was more than twice as fast as software decoding and exceeded even what we see from Intel Quick Sync. Even if the 5090 is more than a workload requires, we are excited to see what this means for upcoming 50-series cards.\n\n>In **rendering applications**, real-time and offline, the 5090 pushes its lead over previous-generation cards even further. It is 17% faster than the 4090 in our Unreal Engine benchmark while also offering more VRAM for heavy scenes. Offline renderers, such as V-Ray and Blender, score 38% and 35% higher than 4090, respectively. This more than justifies the $2,000 MSRP, especially factoring in the added VRAM. The lack of support for some of our normally-tested rendering engines is non-ideal, but we are hopeful NVIDIA will address that issue shortly.\n\n>NVIDIA’s new GeForce RTX 5090 is a monster of a GPU, delivering best-in-class performance alongside a rich feature set. However, it comes along with a huge price tag of $2,000 MSRP; ad likely higher for most buyers, as AIB cards will be a good bit more expensive than that. It also requires that your computer can support that much power draw and heat. If you need the most powerful consumer GPU ever made, this is it. Otherwise, we are excited by what this promises for the rest of the 50-series of GPUs and look forward to testing those in the near future.\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition/)\n\n>At 4K resolution, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 35% performance uplift over the RTX 4090. While this is certainly impressive, it is considerably less than what we got from RTX 3090 Ti to RTX 4090 (+51%). NVIDIA still achieves their \"twice the performance every second generation\" rule: the RTX 5090 is twice as fast as the RTX 3090 Ti. There really isn't much on the market that RTX 5090 can be compared to, it's 75% faster than AMD's flagship the RX 7900 XTX. AMD has confirmed that they are not going for high-end with RDNA 4, and it's expected that the RX 9070 Series will end up somewhere between RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 GRE. This means that RTX 5090 is at least twice as fast as AMD's fastest next-generation card. Compared to the second-fastest Ada card, the RTX 4080 Super, the performance increase is 72%--wow!\n\n>There really is no question, RTX 5090 is the card you want for 4K gaming at maximum settings with all RT eye candy enabled. I guess you could run the card at 1440p at insanely high FPS, but considering that DLSS 4 will give you those FPS even at 4K, the only reason why you would want to do that is if you really want the lowest latency with the highest FPS.\n\n>Want lower latency? Then turn on DLSS 4 Upscaling, which lowers the render resolution and scales up the native frame. In the past there were a lot of debates where DLSS upscaling image quality is good enough, some people even claimed \"better than native\"--I strongly disagree with that--I'm one of the people who are allergic to DLSS 3 upscaling, even at \"quality.\" With Blackwell, NVIDIA is introducing a \"Transformers\" upscaling model for DLSS, which is a major improvement over the previous \"CNN\" model. I tested Transformers and I'm in love. The image quality is so good, \"Quality\" looks like native, sometimes better. There is no more flickering or low-res smeared out textures on the horizon. Thin wires are crystal clear, even at sub-4K resolution! You really have to see it for yourself to appreciate it, it's almost like magic. The best thing? DLSS Transformers is available not only on GeForce 50, but on all GeForce RTX cards with Tensor Cores! While it comes with a roughly 10% performance hit compared to CNN, I would never go back to CNN. While our press driver was limited to a handful of games with DLSS 4 support, NVIDIA will have around 75 games supporting it on launch, most through NVIDIA App overrides, and many more are individually tested, to ensure best results. NVIDIA is putting extra focus on ensuring that there will be no anti-cheat drama when using the overrides.\n\n# [The FPS Review](https://www.thefpsreview.com/2025/01/23/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-video-card-review/)\n\n>There is a lot to unpack in regards to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, and GeForce RTX 50 series from NVIDIA. A lot of technologies have been debuted, and there are a lot of features to test that we simply cannot do in one single review. In today’s review, we focused on the gameplay performance aspect of the GeForce RTX 5090.\n\n>We focused on the GeForce RTX 5090 performance, so subsequent reviews will focus on the rest of the family, and we’ll have to see how they fit into the overall opinion of the RTX 50 series family this generation. For now, we can look at the GeForce RTX 5090 as the flagship of the RTX 50 series, and what it offers for the gameplay experience at a steep price of $1,999, a 25% price bump over the previous generation GeForce RTX 4090.\n\n>If we look back at the average performance gains we saw in just regular raster performance, we experienced performance that ranged from 19%-48%, but there were a lot of common performance gains in the 30-33% range. We did have some outliers that were lower, and some higher, depending on the game and settings. We generally saw gains in the 30% region with Ray Tracing enabled, where scenarios were more GPU-bound.\n\n>We think one problem that is being encountered is that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 is becoming CPU-bound in a lot of games. The data tells us that perhaps even our AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is holding back the potential of the GeForce RTX 5090. Therefore, as newer, faster CPU generations are released, the GeForce RTX 5090’s performance advantage may increase over time. The GeForce RTX 5090 has powerful specifications, but the performance advantage we are currently seeing seems shy of what should be expected with those specifications. It may very well be the case that it is being held back, and it has more potential with better-optimized games or faster CPUs. Time will tell on that one.\n\n>As it stands right now, you should always buy based on the current level of performance, not what might happen. Therefore, at this time you are seeing about a 33% gameplay performance advantage average, but with a 25% price increase, making the price-to-performance value very narrow. The facts are, that the GeForce RTX 5090 has no competition, it does offer the best gameplay performance you can get on the desktop.\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review)\n\n>The RTX 5090 is a lot like this initial review: It's a bit of a messy situation — a work in progress. We're not done testing, and Nvidia isn't done either. Certain games and apps need updates and/or driver work. Nvidia usually does pretty good with drivers, but new architectures can change requirements in somewhat unexpected ways, and Nvidia needs to continue to work on tuning and optimizing its drivers. We're also sure Nvidia doesn't need us to tell it that.\n\n>Gaming performance is very much about running 4K and maxed out settings. If you only have a 1440p or 1080p display, you're better off saving your pennies and upgrading you monitor — and probably the rest of your PC as well! — before spending a couple grand on a gaming GPU.\n\n>Unless you're also interested in non-gaming applications and tasks, particularly AI workloads. If that's what you're after, the RTX 5090 could be a perfect fit.\n\n>The RTX 5090 is the sort of GPU that every gamer would love to have, but few can actually afford. If we're right and the AI industry starts picking up 5090 cards, prices could end up being even higher. Even if you have the spare change and can find one in stock (next week), it still feels like drivers and software could use a bit more time baking before they're fully ready.\n\n>Due to time constraints, we haven't been able to fully test everything we want to look at with the RTX 5090. We'll be investigating the other areas in the coming days, and we'll update the text, charts, and the score as appropriate. For now, the score stands as it is until our tests are complete.\n\n# [Computerbase - German](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-test.91081/)\n\n# [HardwareLuxx - German](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65361-die-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-im-test.html)\n\n# [PCGH - German](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5090-Grafikkarte-281029/Tests/Reviews-Benchmarks-Vergleich-RTX-4090-1463971/)\n\n# [Elchapuzasinformatico - Spanish](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n# Video Review\n\n# [Der8auer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4EdRPT_Mg)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk3fECI-fmw)\n\n# [Gamers Nexus Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWSlOC_jiLQ)\n\n# [Hardware Canucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TJk_P2A0Iw)\n\n# [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA5lFiP3mrs)\n\n# [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulUZ7bf_MXI)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wEXrZSnsRM)\n\n# [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nryZwnVYpns)\n\n# [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q82tQJyJwgk)\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oDxME5APa8)\n\n# [Optimum Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YJNFREQHiw)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J5wDq2ba2E)\n\n# [Techtesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srQHBeWnQzw)\n\n# [Tech Notice (Creators Benchmark)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah0JxguHdp4)\n\n# [Tech Yes City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv-lMrKiwyk=)",

      "Completely normal thing. Honestly, I doubt you'd be able to find any motherboard or gpu made in the last 10 years that doesn't have at least 8 layers.\n\nWith GDDR6/7, PCIE 5.0 and so many VRM phases, I wouldn't even bother starting a design with less than 12 layers, so 14 makes complete sense for a high-end board. I've made a few PCBs with FPGAs for digital signal processing and all those boards had 8 or 10 layers.  \nHere, it's not 14 layers used by signal traces. There's most likely only 6-8 of them. The rest is used by power and ground planes or shielding. Fully expected for advanced high-speed design.",

      "According to the article, 5090 will use the 12v-2x6 connector, the current 40 series uses that connector iirc. I am not sure if atx 3.0 psu’s have those.\n\nEdit: after a quick google search, atx 3.0 only has the 12VHPWR. Currently atx 3.1 has the 12v-2x6 connector.",
      "Yes, you'd have two PSUs in effect. Not sure how much space would be needed or what it would do for efficiency, but it surely it would add some bulk and costs at least. \n\nThen again, your GPU already has a bunch of electronics for manipulating power voltage/stability etc., so it might not be that much."
