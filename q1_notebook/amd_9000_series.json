      "I love my 9070xt it dominates everything I throw at it on ultra and does not run hot for the watts it pulls",
      "4070 ti or 4070 ti super? Since the 9070 xt is around the 5070 ti in raster and 4070 ti super in rt. So, the 9070 xt is just overall a better option than the 4070 ti super. And if you're comparing it to the non super, it's not even close.",
      "Gaming-only, go for 9070XT. If you work with AI, 3D Modelling/Rendering, Nvidia is still king there.",
      "I just switched to 1440p with a 9070xt. Haven't seen less than over 100 fps on anything I've played, yet, with high settings. This is my first Ryzen and Radeon",
      "If the price is right then the 9070xt, even an entry level will dominate the 4070ti",
      "Don't even think about the ti, unless you find a 5070ti for around the same price as the 9070 xt. 9070 xt all day I love mine",
      "Amd had better performance in raster, same or a bit better vs 4000 in raytracing and it has more vram (an important detail in future games).   \n\nOnly benefit of 4070ti is cuda if you need it (i did), need physX (only old games) and DLSS which amd doesn’t support, though many has FSR so not the most important.   \n\nGet the 9000 if you don’t need CUDA",
      "9070 XT runs great no reason to be worried.",
      "9070xt all the way. Dont support Nvidia any longer. They have fooled us all for years. The 10 series was the last time they had our best interests at heart.",

      "Hey, if you got the money and don't want to think, then just get what you usually get. No thinking required.\n\nJust get Nvidia like most sheep. You'll be fine most of the time, until Nvidia decides to harvest you to the slaughter house and charge an arm and a leg for whatever they are selling while you don't notice that the products are getting worse and worse with more defective software.\n\nI'm just venting. This is a rant, so you can ignore my comments.\n\nThe target pricing for the public is in the 300 to 700 range. If you think you are getting good value, then get whatever you prefer, just don't complain about it later if you find out you screwed up.\n\nMost critics don't like that many video cards are priced over 700 dollars, which is why I don't consider most of them for the average user. Both the RX 9070 and the RTX 4070 (all variants) are all overpriced by more than 100 dollars.",
      "The 9070 XT performs around the same as a 5070 Ti (overall), the 5070 Ti is a better 4070 Ti Super and that one is way better than a 4070 Ti since it has 16GB of VRAM instead of 12GB, the 9070 XT is considerably better than a 4070 Ti, if they both cost the same go for the 9070 XT",
      "Depends on the price. The 9070xt is better in 1440p and can also handle 4k.\n\nI have a 4070ti (non super) myself and it can handle any game on 1440p ultra settings above 100fps.\n\nYou don't really need a better GPU if you game at 1440p.\n\nYou'll only be able to get it used at a reasonable Price though I think.\n\nSo it really just depends on price. If you can get a 4070ti cheaper and don't plan on gaming at 4k, get it.\nIf not go for the 9070xt.",
      "If the question were between the 9070 XT and the 5070 TI, I'd say whichever you can find at closer to MSRP. The 9070 XT is better value on paper, but the 5070 TI has better frame gen and tends to be slightly faster. When everything is scalped, though, it just boils down to whichever you can find at a more reasonable price.\n\nThe 4070 ti is still a solid card, but I personally wouldn't buy it unless I were getting an amazing deal on it. Most offerings I see for it are $1000 or more which is simply not worth it.",
      "If you don't want rendering videos or images and ray tracing and dlss 3 , frame generation, AMD is better and faster without AI enhancement",
      "I love my 4070 ti. \n\nI play on 4k/60fps for non competitive games and its been a dream.",
      "personally i would go NVIDIA (but not the older 4070 TI, the 5070 TI) for story games and AMD for competitive games",
      "9070 XT is a better GPU in every aspect.\n\nMore vram, better RAY TRACING, yes it's ray tracing is on par with 4070Ti Super and it's a proper high end card and considering the current market, both of these cards should be at a similar price. Even if you have to pay 150-200$ extra for the 9070 XT just do it, you won't be thinking about those 200$ after 2 years, but you will surely be thinking about the extra 4gb vram"

Not that either prices are great, but it's considerably different than what HUB mentioned about Newegg.",
      "Amd made a point of saying that *they* were going to sell cards at msrp, *unlike* nvidia (literally one of their big talking points during the presentation of the 9070s). The cheapest 9070xt I can find rn is 820€ so hey, good on you on your (overpriced still) 9070xt but when a corporation makes a big show of \"nah mate we're not shitheads like *those guys*\" only to turn around and do *the exact same thing* idk, maybe they should be blasted to hell and back rather than \"what, you guys want to pay msrp for these cards? Have I never heard of such a silly proposition\", wouldn't you think?",

Meanwhile they actually sold the GPU package to retailers at higher price, while offering rebates at launch, so some models can hit 599$. After that AMD keep selling high, rebates were over and retailers even if they wanted to be good guys and sell close to MSRP couldn't. And let's not even talk about the whole AMD marketing around 9070. The famous Azor promising things will get better and we will get those MSRP prices only for it not to happen\n\nIf AMD should be spared from this flak, so should have Nvidia, but they took all the flak. Kudos to the lucky few who managed to buy one at MSRP or close to one.",

      "Because the 600 dollar msrp is a lie. Amd gave out rebates to retailers to make it a 600 dollar card on launch day only. There are no more rebates and these arent being sold to retailers for 600 bucks. The msrp is deliberately a lie from amd. The 9070 xt is not a 600 dollar card and it was never meant to be.",

      "I am waiting for the price to come down. I won’t buy above MSRP.",
      "AMD for sure made bad demand forecasting as always, but one of the factors is that there is no reference cards for MSRP",
      "600€ is not $600, official MSRP in Germany including VAT is 689€, so 750€ is 60€ above official MSRP in Europe. If we did actual currency conversion, $600 without VAT would be 535€, add 20% and you get to around 640€. Basically, official European MSRP is already inflated and actual market prices are much higher than even that inflated MSRP. A 9070 XT at 750€ is about the same value for money as a 500€ 7800XT, with actual 7800XT prices starting at 470€. AMDs newest generation is much worse value than their previous gen cards.",
      "Exactly the same boat here. When I saw the MSRP 5070 Ti (described by AMD as a more powerful card) next to $800+ 9070 XT, there was no longer any point in considering the latter."

      "Yeston does what others dont even dare to do.\n\nIts kinda refreshing to see\n\nbut im really curious how a dual slot, two fan design holds up vs the tripple fan, tripple slot models that came to be standard this generation.\n\nSure the 9070 (non XT) has 100W less power and its possible to cool 220W with a dual slot design.\n\nA tripple slot design for 300-360W for the 9070XT is good. Its big but many people value silence and temps a lot. My Pulse roughly reaches 55C core and 78C Hotspot while the memory is cooking at 90C.   \nHow much metal can you shave off a tripple slot design before it gets too loud/annoying or the memory/hotspot temp get too high?  \nI dont know. With 2 8Pins and a boost clock auf 2970Mhz it seems to be a 300W Powerlimit, but maybe its factory undervolted to reach something like 280W?\n\nEither way interesting GPU, but it might not perform as expected in the tight cases that would benefit from a two slot, two fan design",
      "looks pretty sweet actually. Nice and simple.",
      "No waifu?? Oh the betrayal, Yeston!",
      "Powercolor Reaper 9070XT is dual-slot. I have one and of course it's a bit louder with a smaller cooler but it's not a problem at all if you put the card in efficiency/quiet mode. It still uses up to 300W but keeps the fans down at the expense of higher temps and slightly lower clocks. Which is fine by me, I didn't buy it to squeeze every last fps out of it. So, these new cards from Yeston should do well in that regard.\n\nIt also looks like the Reaper is narrower than these new cards from Yeston so the Reaper may be a better choice if you are trying to fit one in a SFF case. And Alphacool just came out with a water block for the Reaper, that might also weigh in on your decision if you ever want to water cool it.",

Believe me, I was beaten once by scalpers and almost beaten a second time. But I did manage to score my 9070XT on the second try.\n\nThat said I wish they'd made the 9070XT waifu cards two-slot instead of the three-and-a-half slot monstrosity that came out.",

IIRC it really shifted heavily toward bigger cards then.\n\nImo I'd love more smaller cards designs, every GPU targeting something like 55-60C temps is slightly annoying when they can run fine at 75-80C.\n\nBut it's not really a value add for many people to have a small card since no one uses expansion cards anymore, so they just make bigger cards that make them look better in reviews.",
      "Off the top of my head the R9 290X hit 290W TDP with a 2 slot *blower* cooler. It's definitely doable.",
      "maybe im not bad at expressing my point but this card making the case more clearly. the 980 ti is a 601mm chip, a giant chip by any measure. That means you have way more area to transfer thermal load to the heatsink. so the bigger the dye is the easier it is too cool it while using the same power. \n\nMeaning a 600mm 300watt dye will be much easier to cool then a 300mm 300watt dye because it does not have the surface area to transfer the heat as efficiently as the larger dye can",

      "awesome they do it, but 200€ / $ for an 800€/$ card is... debatable, since they sold the water blocks for the more expensive, harder to cool 6900xt for around 150€/$\n\nstill, I'm tempted. their stuff just works",

      "tons of people were complaining about their stuff not shipping and are still in dispute with EKWB about their orders from months ago. You can just look at the subreddit for EKWB. Yes, some orders did arrive, but when you have non-delivery rates this high after costumers have paid in full upfront, something is fucked with the company itself.",
      "Watercooling in general is a little unnecessary.",
      "my guy, custom loops are never good value. you do a custom loop because you want to do a custom loop. custom loops are highly individual and unique, no custom loop is the same as the other. heres a better comparison. why do people buy lego if they can just buy action figures or model cars? building is half the fun and the same goes for custom loops. nobody buys custom loops for the performance, i have a custom loop myself and havent even changed any settings on the gpu regarding clocks or voltage.",
      "Instead of spending 200$ to watercool a 9070 XT, invest 200$ to get a better GPU instead.",
      "Of course it’s fun but it’s also unnecessary 99% of the time. Nothing wrong with that",
      "I agree with this so far, I've not done a lot of testing but the card seems to manage its heat very well as is.",
      "not yet, but people are complaining about orders never shipping or very low quality product for their ridiculously high prices (400$ blocks with tooling marks and scratches)...so not technically dead, but basically dead.",
      "Eh. I don't know. So far my 9070XT runs like at 65°C. The only \"hotspot\" is on the vram at +90°C. But i don't think that justifies this purchase.",
      "Lower temp has never been a main factor for me with watercooling.",
      "I can assure you that while liquid cooling is high cost and high maintenance, it is also objectively the highest cooling power you can get for 24/7. Tuning boundaries pushed out a bit; it's fun",
      "It also really makes sense only for flagship hardware. Buying a $600 card and slapping a $200 waterblock on it when you could have just purchased a $800 card that's faster makes zero sense.",
      "uh. do you realize that this is just a block, right? this isnt an aio, its a block. if you buy that block and put it in your pc, your gpu wont work. it needs radiators, it needs fittings, it needs a pump and a reservoir, it needs a coolant mix, it needs tubes.\n\na custom loop will you usually cost you around a thousand bucks. \n\nofc theyre not value oriented, few build custom loops for the raw cooling performance, its a luxury thing to have. its like having an aquarium with fishes at home instead of just a normal dog as pet.",
      "Yes and no. The performance benefit isn't noteworthy, but it's fun to run a fully watercooled PC.",
      "problem is, theyre the only manufacturer so far offering blocks for the 9070 xt and they have quite a variety of cards, i mean 21 models is quite a lot. even if others follow, its unlikely theyll do all 21 models like alphacool.\n\nthey more or less will have a monopoly on 9070 xt blocks, maybe barrow or bykski will have one and bring down prices but i wouldnt count on it.",
      "on any computer component for that matter😂.",
      "Custom water cooling does have much lower temperatures for a graphics card, but the main reason people use it noise.  You can use big radiators with big slow fans, which are much quieter than any air-cooled graphics card."

      "I welcome PCIe16x. And it makes 100% sense there are lot of people still on PCIe 3 systems today that would welcome a budget GPU (f.e. Ryzen 5xxx if you happened to upgrade on b350 b450 a 520 mobo).",

      "Isn't it like half the die and shaders of a 9070 XT? I'd hope they'd be able to clock that thing higher, only way to squeeze some decent performance out of it.",

Because there are lot of people with PCIE 3.0 systems (shit AMD is still selling and making CPUs and chipset with only PCIE 3 support) where 8x lanes is not enough but 16x will work fine - and nVidia has only 8x offering in this budget segment.",
      "That's for the VRAM but when it runs out is the problem which it has to fetch from the RAM which goes through the PCI-E and being able to transfer it twice as fast will mean that it won't be as slow when it has to fetch from RAM, reducing the impact of having such a small amount of VRAM. For systems with PCI-E 5.0 it won't be as impactful but it will make a lot of difference for those on 3 or 4.",

I'm in another hobby where the manufacturer caps the price their products can be sold by partners, break that agreement and they can cut you off and stop you selling their products. I find it strange watching Nvidia and AMD allowing their partners/retailers to freely do what they do with their pricing.\n\nI had a look out of curiosity last night at some GPUs to see if prices had settled at all and the cheapest 9070XT I could find is the Sapphire Pulse at £650. I'm not currently looking to upgrade my GPU so it doesn't really affect me, but I try to keep up with the prices none the less for when I do a new build.",

They still tend to go quick, but it seems like every other day or two they get more in, and they're usually around for a couple of days.  The 5080's have been in stock for a while, and the 5090's even make appearances once or twice a week.  They're all way over MSRP, though.\n\nI'm unsure about Best Buy since I never have a reason to go there, but I think we're on the verge of seeing them in stock more often.  Just don't expect them at MSRP.",
      "Newegg has 9070xt for 5070ti minus $50, you might be right on that one.  Microcenter has it for $150 less.  But for either one, you have a more stable driver experience with AMD.",

      "power increases have diminishing returns. there's a big dropoff around 330w. there was barely any point running 374w over my stock 340w. the difference between 304w (msrp default) and 374w (max without shunt mod) was about 3% for me only in benchmarks. 2% of that came from 304w -> 330w. lol\n\n\nI just think you and other people are mistaken that they are artificially limited. at first I wondered why the top 2 brands went with 330w default, but now I know\n\n\nyou're free to waterblock yours, but I think you'll find it's nothing special. you'd be better off with a 5080 than waterblocking a 9070 xt",

    "selftext": "So in the last month I was about to test out the Sapphire Pure 9070 and the Gigabyte Eagle OC Ice 5070. The performance surprised me by Nvidia. As we all know the Rtx 50 series are not receiving that much love due to all the issues we have hear. BUT! I overclocked it (300+ core and +2000 memory) and man it’s almost all the games I play it was performing better than the 9070 overclocked as well…. I have a 9800x3d on a asrock b650 motherboard with 64gb of ddr5 6000mhz quad channel ram. The nvidia card does run a little hotter but temps are reasonable. On the 9070 it was sitting at 50-55c gaming with very high/ultra settings and the 5070 60-65c with the same settings. Both cards are amazing, both cards have its favors in games. For streaming the nvidia card is way better of course, always have been. In conclusion, get either card and you can’t go wrong. Just make sure you don’t spend 200$+ the msrp. Max to spend I would say is 650 on either card. But when prices normalize, if they do, go with the 9070 xt for sure. But that post will be at a later time…. 9070 xt vs 5070 ti :) Hope this helps with your gpu purchase ",
    "comments": [
      "I think the 5070 would be seen as a great card if the 40 series didn’t exist…… the issue wasn’t the cards performance, it was the rise in price and lack of performance uplift compared to its predecessor.",
      "Whichever you get at a lower price tbh. The 9070 performs better on average but not so much that you should choose it over a 5070 if you find the 5070 to be priced consistently lower, which in my area I tend to find them at MSRP quite often",
      "10% is a huge performance uplift that most certainly does not come from a driver and apply to all games across the board. That’s game to game basis at best, and ones that already performed worse",
      "Cyberpunk is less intense on vram than Indiana jones, but you can get both games to use more than 12gb of vram at 1440p in my experience. 9070 falls behind in rt which will hurt it in Indiana jones, but as far as I’m aware the amd cards actually do decent in cp ray tracing this gen.",
      "To be honest I wouldn't listen to a thing you said after you said the mod requires a dual bios, something it doesn't \n\nalso I refer your statement back to you\n\n>   \nHoly crap read you baboon\n\nAs what I said are valid critics on you claiming you are over clocking and pushing both cards... are you really in any country where overclock voids your warranty so will bios flashing... in any country where it doesn't it will not. \n\nSo long story short for the person who actually isn't reading ... it is no more unsafe than overclocking meaning it is worth the same same to do if you can. By not doing it you aren't have a true apples to apples test. This gives the Nvidia an unfair advantage. You should admit that instead of saying, \"AAAAAAAGAIN I WOULDN\"T DO IT.\" because while you may not by ignoring the fact you are actively lying to people through omission that you preformed a fair and balanced test.",
      "Depending on the kind of games one runs, as well as the resolution, the 5070 is often crippled by the insufficient vram. It's not a bad card, but it has limits in one particular aspect and is often held back by poor design. Nvidia has more mature upscaling and other features (fgen, mfg stand out) that use non-insignificant amounts of vram. So naturally, green cards that normally suffer from vram amounts are held back even more.",
      "“Just make sure you don’t spend 200$+ the msrp.” Great advice.",
      "I've had my 5070 for almost 2 months and have no issues with it. On my 1440p 240hz OLED monitor , with DLSS and Frame gen, I hit 224 FPS locked on everything I ever throw at it , with my temps being below 65 C. Smooth ,quiet and beautiful on that OLED",
      "But you are not wrong there. especially the 40 super series",
      "In the most recent driver update the 50 series did get another 10% performance uplift. We just need to wait and see if the reviews revisit the 50 series in the next couple of months.",
      "I didn't run to any. Maybe because I haven't played games like Indian Jones or Cyberpunk because I don't own those games.",
      "5070ti is really a different card than the 5070 and worth it if you find at msrp. Very few 9070xt are going for anywhere near msrp so the pricing is pretty close. The 4070 was also a disappointment for the most part.",
      "I don't play in 4k. You try it and let me know how it goes.",
      "I was playing with my 5070 on my G9 57\"... 7680x2160...only in Warthunder, but I usually run max detail sans RT and 120fps with DLSS on balanced was no issue at all. It was using about 50w more power than my 4090 at the same settings though. VRAM didn't max out either.\n\nWas perfectly playable.\n\nDid some FH5 also at the same res, all set to ultra, again with DLSS and it was perfectly usable.\n\n5070Ti arrives today to play with, let's see how it is. Should hopefully be a good FG card as thats its main purpose for me.",
      "They honestly don’t remember..I read their stupid comments everyday and remind them that a 4080 was $1199 msrp with the same performance as a $750 5070ti",
      "Thx. I want to get the 9070 but the 5070 is consistently much cheaper",
      "Cyberpunk won't run into any VRAM issues even with PT",
      "Just wait for a 9070 it will be worth it",
      "Thanks 🙏 for games I didn’t text others are helping out with that 😁 lol so this helps lol",
      "Yes the 5070 is an amazing card for 1440 gaming"

They also sometimes had the nitro and the pulse cards, but I really didn't like the aesthetic of the pulse card. Soo....\n\nUltimately, I think the thing that hurts these cards is that they cost like $100 less than the nitro. With a 2x8pin setup, they also don't OC much (if at all). \n\nSo what? It's a 10% difference in performance (on a good day) for way more power, more heat and wear.. ehh... \n\nAnd the steel legend has one thing none of the other 9070xts have. **RGB Fans**. It's funny because the old Nitros were always available with them (usually called Nitro SE+)."

Why is Navi48 so much more dense than Blackwell (it's almost equivalent to a node shrink). He basically admits he doesn't know. I will have a guess: the 64mb of cache in both designs are not quite the same. Nvidia uses L2 which is typically higher performing - and to get the L2 transistors to perform higher the 'library/design' won't be as dense. L3 cache is typically a little slower (latency), and hence the transistor design can be a little more aggressive/denser. This doesnt explain the whole difference, but possibly a chunk of it.",

If the gel leaks out after thermal cycling and exposes components to thermal damage, that would be really bad (almost as bad as gigabytes exploding PSUs).

      "Good option atm if you're in the market for an upper midrange GPU looking to upgrade but as they said that says more about the state of the market than the 9070 XT being amazing in a vacuum.\n\nFor me would basically be a sidegrade/downgrade, wish AMD hadn't bailed on the high end this gen. Something like a 9080 XT that exceeds a 5080 in performance for $800-$900 MSRP would've been very appealing.",

If you don't think that the price that is being charged is fair value, don't buy the card. If none of these things appeal to you, don't buy anything until a card reaches whatever your personal requirements are.\n\nAMD delivered a card (9070 XT) that is either slightly behind its nearest competitor (5070 TI) for meaningfully less money, or well ahead of its nearest competitor (5070) for slightly more money. They've mostly closed the gap on raytracing workloads that don't use Nvidia-specific stuff, and largely equalised upscaling with FSR4 all while having fewer hardware faults and more robust drivers. That feels like a good deal to me, and apparently a bunch of people agree with that since they're outselling their competition by a fairly considerable margin atm.\n\nAll of the alternate universe BS where for some reason AMD released this exact card at this exact price despite every other circumstance being different and AMD charging head first into stepping on a rake anyway is a complete waste of time.\n\nEvaluate the market you're in. AMD did fine, probably did their reputation in the market a world of good, will probably gain some market share in this segment. Hopefully for the health of the market, the 9060s do well and they maintain a good position to be able to produce something great with their next major release.",

Or that it was luikewarm improvement.\n\nWas Raytracing improvements massive compared to 7000-series? Yes, the numbers talk for themselves.\n\nWhat is interesting to me, is the number of graphics cores on 9070 XT is something like 20 cores less. Yet, it matches or beats the previous gen. 64 compute units compared to 84 on the 7900 XT for example. That is more than 20% less CUs. In other words, massive gains per CU.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XrX2yef7Vg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XrX2yef7Vg)\n\nOnly thing letting that card down is the scalping going on, including from the retailers, in my book.",

    "comments": [
      "While it is a rumour as AutoMod pointed out. I remember reading somewhere that Sapphire designed a few reference PCBs for Radeon Cards in the past. So it is reasonable to assume the Pulse is basically the AMD reference for all intentents and purposes.",
      "Sapphire has long been the primary partner for AMD reference design.",
      "Sapphire has long been the EVGA of AMD Radeon cards",
      "sapphire has long since usually been the one that also manufactured BBA (built by ATI) gpus too.",
      "Sapphire has long been the Smokey to AMD’s Bandit.",
      "I feel like this leak has been leaking for like a week now. I've seen this news numerous times now.",
      "And anyone who's used AMD/ATi cards for a long time basically knew this already",
      "Is the GPU being rectangular new? I don't think i've seen something like this before. I thought most were square?",
      "The Shaggy to AMD's Scooby.",
      "WHAT? AMD reference design is built in collaboration with their biggest and most well regarded partner? Say it ain't so!\n\nLove me some sapphire. Bought a lot of vapour chamber designs from them back in the day, when AMD(ATI) was still competing at the VERY high end.",
      "They're definitely stringing it out as thin as they can.",
      "It really depends on the designs. Some GPUs and CPUs are perfectly square, some others, rectangular. And some are square but at an angle, compared to the rest of the PCB.",
      "And even then sapphire has replaced multiple r9 290s for me",
      "Makes sense since Sapphire has been the most trustworthy for more than a decade now. I still remember buying a R9 295x2 second hand and it worked up until I got a 1080 ti.",
      "Ehhh, EVGA had killer Customer service but occasional build issues.\n\nSapphire is 'to hell with customer service, build that thing to the nines, they won't need it then'.",
      "I think the idea was that AMD took the 9060 die and mirrored it to make the 9070 die, which is why it's so long",
      "I'm really liking the aesthetics at any rate. Look like something out of the movie [2001 A Space Oditty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001%3A_A_Space_Odyssey)",
      "It's actually PC Partner Group who makes the reference cards and does customs for Sapphire.",
      "Look at that beautiful small card. Make some sub 250mm, 2.5 slot cards for smaller cases.",
      "Have a pulse, seems far higher quality than thr \"budget\" option it's sold as \nThis may be why it overclocks so well"

      "Gonna get a waifu-ish card from China when I go there next month. Look like all out of stock atm though, finger crossed. \n\nEven in China 9070/XT sold out, this has been a huge lunch for AMD. China historically is very Nvidia inclined, people on buy AMD at last resort , 9070 sold out this fast is another sign how bad the GPU supply has been for the last few years.",
      "We need better-designed coolers ***NOT*** bigger and bigger coolers.\n\nNVIDIA has shown that it's possible to cool 600W with a dual-slot design.\n\nI hope that AIBs copy NVIDIA's Double Flow-Through design",
      "Yeah I don’t think I like any of the AIB designs this gen. Rdna3 cards looked much better. In addition to looking weird this Gen, I’m also annoyed that the xfx cards are still just too damn thick and long even for a midrange card. Overall the Gigabyte Gaming and especially Powercolor Reaper have the least gimmicks and are the most compact form factor and the reaper is msrp. I would say I like the Asus prime one too, but fuck Asus\n\nEdit: hellhound looks nice, I always liked the blue inside the fans, but unfortunately not as close to msrp as I’d like unless Im mistaken",
      "Wouldn't be yeston's first time...",
      "Nvidia stopped production on 40 series to make more of their AI chips. They said it was for 50 series, but we now know they allocated like 1% of the capacity. Maybe.",
      "And here I am hoping that we get another decent $300-500 range card that fits in a case that can only accommodate 27cm-long GPUs.",
      "So keen on the Reaper but it's gonna be impossible to get",
      "I mean most of last year was fine, there were plenty of Ada refresh and RDNA 3 cards with some good sales toward the end of production. It's just been maybe November to now that's been absolute shitshow. Most of it due to Nvidia's paper launch.",
      "I just got my hellhound and I think it’s in the same category of not being overdone and not super thick like the reaper",
      "Pinned comment on YouTube says a pricing video is coming",
      "Yeah, totally. Why sell for 1-2k when you can sell for 10k each with 8+ figure contracts",
      ">We need better-designed coolers NOT bigger and bigger coolers.\n\nSFF builders and people with all kinds of PCIe cards need smaller coolers. I would like to see a competitive dual slot option available for AMD customers (like the 5090FE), but I would hate to see that become the predominant style that’s available. The FE cooler would be a waste of money for someone like myself, who has the space for a bigger cooler, doesn’t need the extra slots, and might want to buy a waterblock one day (now I have daughterboards for no reason).\n\nNot defending any of the designs that are much thicker than 3 slots though; that’s excessive in my opinion, and I don’t want to worry about it sagging.",
      "Yeah I wouldn’t classify nvidia as a graphics card company at this point. It’s an ai card company that makes some graphics cards .",
      "Probably worse. When the crypto bubble imploded, we at least got many cards in the used market pushing prices down. With AI, there's no end in sight, and at the end of it, we will have just electronic waste.",
      "I have the Midnight black 6800XT and it's the coolest looking design ever IMO. Not too over designed but has a nice flair to it. \n\nIt's super annoying that we have no reference cards for the 9070 cards because I think AMD's reference designs tend to be the best and most classy.",
      "This was really funny",
      "[The Hellhound is actually accented in blue as opposed the Red Devil.](https://www.powercolor.com/Upload/202501/product_feature_2025010613325402.webp)",
      "Maybe they got seeded the one Lisa Su was holding at launch",

    "selftext": "",
    "comments": [
      "The downclocked memory is going to hurt if true, but I do wonder how much of the speed you could get back with an overclock.",
      "Presumably because last gen's GRE was a 900/80 series equivalent so it commanded the extra complimentary RAM if I had to guess.",
      "Why would they have less ram than last generation's GRE?",
      "Less powerful version",
      "It's just lack of consistency in AMD's naming. In either case the GRE is the third most powerful GPU of the series. \n\nThe 7900 series should've probably been called the 7900 and the 7900 XT rather than the XT and XTX.",
      "Probably not much if they lock it down like they've done for other cut down models",
      "Interesting. \n\nSo the 9070 GRE is a worse version of the base 9070, whereas the 7900 GRE was a worse version of the 7900 XT. Am I getting that right?\n\nI feel like that's a bit confusing, no? One would have expected the 9070 and 9070 GRE to have their names swapped.",
      "It has 50% more RAM than the RX 7650 GRE though. (Lol yes I know you mean the other last gen GRE card, the 7900 GRE).  More seriously though, AMD uses the GRE branding for oddball bins of its chips that are mainly focused on the Chinese market (though the 7900 GRE did get a global release of course).",
      "It was Golden Rabbit Edition, but then AMD changed it to Great Radeon Edition after people bugged them about the name no longer making sense.",
      ">get close to the regular 9070.\n\nLol, you are daydreaming. \n\n9070 GRE will not only have 15% fewer ALUs, it also has 33% fewer ROPs, 48MB Infinity $ and much less bandwidth.\n\nThat 33% missing ROPs alone would be impossible to compensate with just overclocking.",
      "Utter FAILURE in product naming!\n\nPostpone 9060 launch and rebrand/name those SKU's to 9050 and 9050XT, then rebrand and rename the 9070GRE to 9060XT.   \nResult: 256bit 16x pci-e 16Gb 9070(XT) > 192bit 16x pci-e 12Gb 9060XT, 128bit 8x pci-e 8Gb 9050(XT).\n\nBack to basics like when RDNA1 was released: 256bit 16x pci-e 8Gb 5700(XT), 192bit 16x pci-e 6Gb 5600XT, 128bit 8x pci-e 4/8Gb 5500XT. \n\nThis is the only logical naming approach AMD that makes sense, also from a marketing perspective and possible a legal perspective!",
      "It doesn’t sound like that great of a card tbh",
      "anything over 400 usd and it’s not worth",
      "“Great Radeon edition” for the worst sku in the lineup. Great job amd marketing!",
      "I mean there are some 9070 models you could get to XT level with a bit of tweaking, but we'll see.",
      "The 7900 GRE used the same Navi 31 die as the 7900 XTX and 7900 XT, but with the memory bus cut down to 256-bit (from 384-bit on the fully enabled XTX and 320-bit on the less cut-down XT).\n\nThe 9070 GRE is a Navi 48 like the 9070 and 9070 XT, but with its memory bus cut from 256-bit to 192-bit, which means that it can do 12 GB of memory or 24 GB if they clamshell it.\n\nAs for why they're cutting it down instead of leaving it at 256-bit to match the 7900 GRE, it's because the product presumably exists largely for the sake of using dies that have faults that prevent that from being possible.",
      "It also stands for Golden Rabbit Edition as it was a China release during the year of the rabbit. GRE ended up sticking apparently since that was a few years ago.",
      "Bro AMD likes to rename and change naming schemes of gpu like every 2 to 3 generations :-D",
      "Note that the XTX was the flagship before, XT is the flagship now.",

      "The 9070 is far better than the 5070 and they are available (unlike the 5000 series paper launch).\n\nThat being said dlss is still far better than fsr, so if you can get your hands on a cheap 5070 (if that is even possible) It maybe worth It, though It seems that AMD is fanally catching Up to Nvidia with FSR 4.",
      "9070, that 4gb of vram makes a difference.",
      "The 9070 is better by a good margin, but I'd suggest 5070 on this one, as 9070 is supposed to be a super budget friendly card but clearly it isn't as of now.",
      "5070 is better apart from the vram",
      "because $50 diff is only real in the US. it many markets, at MSRP the difference is closer to $100. and only for more consuption and ~10% difference in fps.",
      "Then i guess it’s really dependent on your upgrade cycle. If you don’t upgrade frequently id go for more vram. If you do grab the 5070 it should do a good job",
      "In the UK the 5070 is quite readily available at £539.99. Personally the 12gb vram is a hard sell when you can get a 9070 for similar money with more vram, better raster performance and what looks to be decent RT performance and a software stack that is almost at parity. \n\n\nUltimately it comes down to how available either are and what you specific use case is. \n\n\nAMD drivers are not as bad as many make out and their adrenalin software is better than the Nvidia App in my opinion.",
      "I’d wait until you could get them at msrp. I have seen some 5070s for $550 but honestly if you’re playing at 2k or above i wouldn’t justify such a big purchase on a GPU with 12gb of vram. It’s precisely why I’m getting rid of my 4070ti. I got it for $675 and it’s been fantastic but at 3440x1440 it’s starting to worry me.",
      "9070 is significantly better than the 5070 get the 9070",

      "Yea i think ima go with the rtx 5070 due to being able to get it at msrp unlike the rx 9070 and the vram wont really limit me in the games i play.",

      ">what are u talking about the 5070 is the only card with decent avalability at msrp. The only day the 9070 have better stock was the day of launch.\n\nBecause there was actually a real stock of the 9070's, unlike the 5000's.\n\nAnd i dont know where do you live, but in my country there are no 5070 at MSRP, they all cost as much as 9070 while being considerably worse.\n\n>the cheapest 9070 costs over 20 percent more than the cheapest 5070 rn while not giving even 10 percent more perf on average.\n\nThe 9070 gives way more than 10 percent more perf than the 5070, which is one of the reasons both the 9070 and the xt are selling like hotcakes.",
      "I don't really trust pcpartpicker prices since it includes scalpers. I have personally seen the 9070 & 5070 in stock at $550 usd, and I would pick the 9070 over that, but I don't know how supply is doing in the canadian market. For me personally, I would not get a gpu with 12gb of vram",
      "Absolutely 100% 9070 has more vram and performance and not driver issues compared to the 50 series black screening",
      "Definitely will jump to 1440p",
      "Those kind of \"paper comparisons\" are useless, because at the end of the day the only thing that matters is real usage performance, and only benchmarks shows that, and in benchmarks the regular 9070 destroys the 5070 while also being considerably cheaper, the only thing the 5070 is better is in dlss 4, but AMD is catching Up to Nvidia with fsr4, and ray/pathtracing.\n\nHere i drop you a benchmark of al 9070's VS 5070's, but you can look for more of you want:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aWOBTszuXxI?si=6DbpeOsELEy2qGAB",

      "Red devil has 0 noise. It's crazy. Even when running 100% usage, and undervolted with 3300 mhz.",
      "My Red Devil 7900XTX on the other hand, literally screams at me like the actual devil in certain situations. That boy got some coil whine. I love it though lol",
      "TLDR:   \nPerformance is almost identical between the 2 models   \n       \n- Sapphire Nitro+ RX 9070XT: Removable magnetic back plate cover, 3.2 slot, 330.8(L)X 128.5(W)X 65.68 (H)mm, 1591 gr (1898 gr with cover), support bracket included, **12V-2x6 power connector**, no Dual BIOS, consumes more power (346.5 W vs 327.7 W)    \n- PowerColor Red Devil RX 9070XT: 3.5 slots, 340(L)X 132(W)X 69(H)mm, 1538 gr, GPU holder included, 3x 8-pin power connectors, Dual BIOS, OC BIOS runs slightly hotter (62 vs 59 degrees), slightly more quiet",
      "I guess when some other brands push AMD power limits there's very not much benifit. It seems that PowerColor was aware of that and preffer to opt for much more silent operation rather than pushing the fan to operate at high speed just to get 1 or 2 frames per second. Props to PowerColor for that.\n\nFrom my understanding, PowerColor has their OC bios, 330W where Taichi is 340W and Sapphire 340W? not sure if anyone can confirm those.",

      "I was going for the Nitro+ but it sold out in the 5 minutes it took me to drive to the store and they only had the red devil so I got it instead.\n\nWhile the aesthetic is certainly better on the nitro+ I still think, the red devil performs incredibly well, it is practically silent with no fan noise and no coil whine, exactly what I wanted.",
      "Cable is fine when 600 watts aren’t running through it.",
      "Crazy because mine doesn't make any noise.",
      "My Sapphire 9070XT reports as 330W. Can only increase power 10%, so 363W is maximum. The card itself reports its own power spikes in HWINFO, and I've seen as high as 575W (likely 1ms) under \"GPU Power Maximum.\" I like info like that.",
      "I have the nitro + it is a nice card. I also have the Gigabyte Aorus Elite coming as I got a killer deal on it. I'll try it out and see which one undervolts / OC better. So far for real world stability the Nitro + can only sustain -60mv underclock or it does driver crash in Helldivers 2 after a while.",
      "Yeah this seems like proper usage of the connector. Even with brief spikes it should be within tolerance. \n\nStill I wouldn't want it personally.",
      "Has to be Sapphire.",
      "The 9070xt Red Devil Limited Edition comes with a metal keycap for your enter key that has little fans that spin when you brush your finger across it.  For that alone, Red Devil wins for me because it is an amazing fidget spinner.",
      "The Nitro+ only draws 330w, around half of what the 12v cable is rated for.",
      "Not sure about the Nitro+ but my Taichi has had 6 near consecutive hours on full load several times with no connector issues so far. Swapping my old PSU with 12v horsepower to a new one with ATX 3.1 compatibility soon so hopefully nothing comes up with that.",
      "Can't wait to hear how you compare the Aorus Elite to the Nitro+. Also, nice to hear people being honest about their \"stable\" undervolts. So many people with \"yeah I'm 100% stable at -120mv and 2850 fast timings\" and it's like, 1. Your memory OC will crash in two minutes of memtest vulkan and 2. Your \"stable\" undervolt will crash under real world gaming conditions and probably in the boss battle.",
      "Seen somewhere that PowerColor Red Devil are 330W, which is just 10W less than Taichi I believe at 340W. It's interesting to see they actually had more power phases VS Sapphire, it's always a good thing for reliablity.\n\nLove the Red Devil design, had a couple from previous gens and they were always cool & super quiet.",

      "The 5070 ti has about 9% better performance when not using ray tracing. It also has better upscaling. To me, that puts them at roughly equal value at their respective MSRPs. Both are good choices. Do you want better performance or lower cost?",
      "Why the hell would u want a 9070xt if u have the money for a 5070ti\nGet a 9070xt if u don't want ray tracing but who doesn't? U only live once if u have the money. And Reddit is 90% amd and want Nvidia to fail for some schizophrenic reason.\n\nNvidia is popular",

      "[https://i.imgur.com/THNe9lq.png](https://i.imgur.com/THNe9lq.png)\n\nFSR is open source. Not to mention, the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds also hates nvidia, and has openly criticized how difficult it was to work with them. And nvidia's software is actually horrible. It doesn't even let you use the software without creating a nvidia account. Do I need to explain why that is a bad thing?\n\nNot to mention how the overlay and geforce apps hurt performance, with many features being hit or miss in many games. AMD's software includes features like overclocking, monitoring, etc. and there is zero effort in using it (Especially no account creation needed). So no, Nvidia's software is not miles ahead, it's behind in many ways.\n\nDLSS4 might be good, but FSR4 comes very close, and looks like it will only get better with time, just like DLSS did.\n\nEdit: Oh, and regarding your point about game support for optiscaler, if you had just read the huge note that is mentioned, in bold, at the top of the compatibility list, you may have found that the list isn't complete, as Optiscaler FSR4 just got released and is in alpha  -\n\n\"**This is** `not` **a complete list of games supported by OptiScaler.**\n\nOptiScaler is compatible with most games that support `DLSS 2+`, `FSR 2+` or `XeSS`.  \nThe list below includes games and configuration options shared by our community members.\"",

Not exactly smashing it out of the park, according to me.\n\nEdit: it's the 9070xt with 37fps. To be clear.",
      "If it's the same money get the 5070ti, rt is faster. It all depends on the price. Where I am from 5070 at launch was more expensive than 9070xt by 300 euro. Now they are similarly priced and that makes the 9070xt a better choice, though both are horrible priced. The 5070ti is even worse. Honestly at 1100 dollars like you said you have them, they are both horrible priced. That gpu is worse than the 1000 dollars 4080 super, and you pay more for it.",
      "Not just better raytracing. Dlss4 is still better quality than FSR4 and better game support (yes optiscaler, but native support is betterer). Mfg actually looks pretty compelling, reviews are decent",
      "I own a 5070ti and for that price just go with the 9070XT, it's very very close to 5070ti basically it's a tie. They both outperform each other depending upon the title. But I must say after coming from a 7800XT, the ray tracing and path tracing feels next level with dlss but then again it's not worth the extra 150$ in my opinion, maybe extra 50$ at max",
      "Honestly might be one of the best takes I’ve seen on the situation.\n\nI’ve been feeling bad about my purchase of a 5070 with all the hate going around but the performance gaps seem so neglible for casual gaming and I’m very much the type of person to crank on all the graphics settings so the game looks pretty.\n\nWith how I play I’d rather path tracing over higher fps",
      "Not to mention Nvidia's stinginess with VRAM, which limits the lifespan of most of their more expensive cards for said high fidelity games.",
      "This is a great explanation for why one should buy one or the other. I personally bought a 9070 (non xt) but I did because of what this man said. I don't do AAA gaming and I wanted the extra vram for more future proofing. Either way op goes though, I hope he is happy",
      "Derbaur recommends undervolting the card and increasing the power target, effectively boosting clock speeds - giving about a 10% boost over stock... 👍",
      "This is the opinion I value the most..someone with both AMD and NVIDIA experience.",
      "Thats the case I am also looking at it money wise. I wanna know if nearly 300e difference for base models is fair price diff. I used to have 7900xt and before 6900xt so not using RayTracing so extensively is not a big loss for me bht from what I have tested Rtx is pretty solid even on this 9070xt. But PT is tragic thats for sure.\n\nIf only there were msrp 5070ti ...I would take it right away :D"

      "\"The Radeon RX 9070 series Linux experience was stable (I didn't encounter a single hang / kernel oops or any other problems like that!) and was smooth from desktop to gaming. It was a very pleasant initial AMD RDNA4 experience on Linux. This was a great at-launch experience using the upstream and open-source driver support from AMD. The one thing though... There's room left for performance optimizations. The main downside of my initial Linux testing was that the performance wasn't as great as what's been reported under Windows 11 with the official Radeon Windows driver. Relative to the Radeon RX 7900 series on Windows, the RX 9070 performance on Linux was less enticing right now.\"",
      "You don't typically \"update drivers\" in Linux. You update the kernel.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n\"What you're probably wanting to know first up as a Linux gamer/enthusiast... All of the Radeon RX 9070 series support is upstream in the Linux kernel and Mesa.  \\[...\\]\n\nOn the kernel side, Linux 6.12 LTS and newer is what's recommended for the Radeon RX 9070 series. Linux 6.12 is last year's Long Term Support kernel version and fortunately the RX 9070 series support should be \"good enough\" for those using that version. But as is typically the case with new hardware support at launch, the newer the kernel the better. So if able to, using Linux 6.13 stable is recommended and the Linux 6.14 kernel will be out later this month. For my testing I was using Linux 6.14 Git to enjoy the most up-to-date AMD open-source driver support available.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nAMD has tested the Radeon RX 9070 series to be working out-of-the-box on the likes of Fedora 41 or with Ubuntu 25.10 as well when fetching the latest AMDGPU firmware files. The needed RX 9070 / RDNA4 firmware files are all upstream in linux-firmware.git, so make sure you have those bits as well if planning to buy a Radeon RX 9070 series graphics card.\"\n\nSo find a distro with the kernel version you need and/or update Mesa as per the instructions in the article. Or wait for kernel updates on the distro you're using.",
      "Is it possible/easy to update drivers in linux? Or are we just stuck with what the distro gives us?\n\nEdit: why the downvote? I'm asking because I honestly don't know and want to know.",

And then the ones that there are, sometimes break like a number of the now-older Feral game ports not working nicely on modern distros. Occasionally Proton (Steam Play) causing issues for some Windows games, etc.\n\nSolutions used by some Windows reviewers like Auto Hot Keys and the like unfortunately don't work on Linux especially with X11/Wayland differences, complications around Proton, etc.\n\nIn turn I am also relying on what the game / game engine exposes for performance data and do show frame times where exposed and the like with some of the overlay/external reporting not always working out accurately/reliably on Linux I prefer to source just from the game engine...\n\nTLDR: if there is any newer games that work on Linux that are automated/benchmark friendly, I am more than happy to incorporate them but they are rare. That's also in part why many of the Linux GPU driver developers just rely on repeating shader runs and the like but aren't realistic there either for not executing the game logic, etc.",

While the following suggestion is still a synthetic benchmark and thus doesn't really address my concern, Decay might be worth including to represent Godot Engine.\n\nI wonder if it'd be worth mentioning this to developers of native Linux games while they're still in early access; many might not realize this is a desirable feature to build into their games. I'm sure that there are at least a few who would be motivated to do so if it gave them a good shot at being featured on Phoronix. Maybe reach out to Alderon Games and/or Kerzoven?",

They do have some suitable benchmarks but alas not the type of benchmarks gamers would want to see...\n\ne.g. [https://benchmarks.godotengine.org/](https://benchmarks.godotengine.org/)  \n[https://github.com/godotengine/godot-benchmarks](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-benchmarks)\n\nLooking more at the primitive engine performance and would be likely more criticized then Xonotic or other open-source games but not modern...\n\nFor game developers I do interact with, I do passionately promote for better benchmarking support to encourage testing by reviewers / more likely to be tested by IHVs and ISVs / etc. Sadly though the investment by the game developers in working on such capabilities typically doesn't pan out for them in a quantifiable manner.",

      "MangoHUD can take care of performance metrics (there were some issues with Wayland/X11 and accuracy, but that's been I think a few years since I heard about any issues or at least aside from compositor bugs) but that still doesn't take care of automating the game/execution logic for being able to automatically launch and replay a desired scene for reliably ensuring given settings are applied and reproducible scene/etc are used (where AutoHotKeys is used by some Windows reviewers for similar games paired with FRAPS or other programs). It can work for a couple select games (and I used a similar approach for some now-obsolete UE4 benchmark demos with an overlay) but it unfortunately doesn't really help in any large manner.",

I only got it because 4090s we're 2x the MSRP and a 4080 was nearly identical performance but also higher cost than the xtx.\n\n9070xt is better than AMDs \"top-of-the-line\" card. Of course it's going to sell well.\n\nI just wish AMD could make a real \"high performance\" card to offer an NVIDIA alternative. I know they'd never take over that market but just having the option would be nice."

      "Interesting part:\n\nFinally, we have some concerns about how \"real\" the $600 MSRP actually is. After some investigation, it appears that AMD is providing retailers with a $50 rebate to achieve the $600 pricing. This strongly suggests the intended MSRP was actually $650, and AMD is temporarily subsidizing models to hit the lower price point.\n\nFor example, XFX confirmed that the 9070 XT Mercury – a model featured in this review – will not cost $650. In fact, it won't even cost $700. Instead, the official MSRP is $770, and due to tariffs, its on-shelf price is expected to be $850 – which would be tragic if true.\n\nFrom what we've gathered, it seems AMD is starting to play Nvidia's pricing game. This means that while some 9070 XT models may be available at $600 initially, most will likely be priced higher, and restocks at that price may be limited or infrequent. A lot will depend on how sales perform. AMD has a large stock of Radeon 9070 GPUs, so if demand slows after launch, we expect them to continue offering rebates to keep pricing competitive. However, we will have to wait and see how that plays out.",
      "The rebate could also just be covering the increased cost for the tariffs and that 600 is indeed the intended price.\n\nSo we could see prices go up in the US if tariffs don't go away.",
      "something is wrong with their setup because there are huge inconsistencies between 2k and 4k for all games",
      "lol above $800 the card would be DOA",
      "I like the Taichi card the best aesthetically, it looks really nice. But the premium on it is kinda yikes. the spreadsheet says 740 for the taichi so an extra $140. Not sure thats worth it. DEFINITLY dont buy the asus ones imo. Asus is just a crappy company that has been doing some shady and even illegal stuff with not honoring warranties and such. The premiums on their cards is also outrageous.",
      "The mining boom already proved that when no cards are available that people will pay over MSRP to get SOMETHING. Whatever they end up selling for, it won't be anything close to what Nvidia gpus are going for right now. Saw a 5070 ti get listed for $1250 on eBay and sold almost immediately this morning",
      "The spreadsheet says that the taichi will be 740. If thats true im still not sure I really like that price, 140$ is a lot to ask for on a card that has an MSRP of 599. It does have the 3100 boost clock though and the other AIB cards that have the 3100 boost clock have higher premiums than this card has, if the spreadsheet is right.",
      "esa madre deberia costar 12 mil pesos mexicanos y vale 25 mil XD se pasan de lanza los revendedores.",
      "It's interesting HUB maintain the standpoint of \"Reviewers should always test using best CPU to remove any potential bottleneck in GPU benchmarks\" (see their B580 performance using midrange CPUs video, where viewers questioned testing using 9800x3D on midrange cards).\n\n\nBut their test benches always use pretty mediocre SSD. This time it's MSI SPATIUM M470, PCIe 4.0 drive that barely beats PCIe 3.0 ones, even slower than Crucial P5 at times. Last year they used TeamGroup Cardea A440, also a pretty average drive.",
      "Its going to be 750-850 depending on model.  On the scalped market its going to be $1200-1400.  Its going to be the same price as the 5070 Ti with slightly less performance.  I have been through this multiple times, the price will not be competitive.",
      "Being able to buy the card is key. I feel it'll be sold out in < 10 seconds everywhere. I mean if you want to stand out in line at a microcenter then so be it.",

      "As much as people like to knock the 9070 in favor of the XT, I like it.\n\n* I game on a 1080p at 60fps. The 9070 seems plenty powerful enough for that.\n* Video suggests (@ 25:56) it's one of the top power-efficient GPUs on the market.\n* It fits my current 650W power supply with only two 8-pin plugs. I'd have to spend $150+ more on another to use the XT.",
      "I undervolted 9070XT (-60mV right now, so far so good) and power limited to 165. Lost only 5 - 7% performance in Kingdom Come. Seems to depend on the game a bit.",
      "Was looking up 9070 benchmarks to feel better about having to settle for the non-XT, after having my XT cancelled by Newegg after getting order confirmation, only to have that one cancelled too. Fuck this.",
      "165 watts? For performance that is still a few % above a stock 9070? That's some serious perf/W right there",
      "Lower temps and less power usage",
      "They're not so much knocking the GPU which is, as you say, a perfectly good one, as the pricing.",
      "My current GPU is an EVGA 1060.\n\nI want its replacement to also last for a long time. It might be a bit overkill for now, but in a few years I hope it will still be capable of running the newest stuff at that framerate. Also not currently a fan of Nvidia.",
      "cant get it in Europe anyway. seems like none of these big tech companies want my money I guess.",
      "Yes! The undervolt allows the GPU clock to stay around 2200 - 2400 Mhz. But it depends on the game/workload. I just tried Path of Exile 2, and its performance hit from stock is about 11%, whereas Medieval Dynasty only lost about 2%.\n\nI was really curious about this when I bought it - reviewers did not do much undervolting. Almost went with the 9070 because I was afraid of the heat in my ITX case, but it's totally a non-issue.",
      "I wonder later on if it’s possible, like in the past with AMD GPUs such as the 5700 (which could have its BIOS flashed to a 5700 XT or even AMD Vega 56 to 64), to perform a similar BIOS flash on the AMD 9000 series GPUs since they're the same die. Majority of the AMD 9070 has 2x8 PCIE and some model has 3x8 PCIE which is unusual for a card that's power efficient, maybe the power is locked via software?",
      "its really efficient. Mine is using 0 watts.",
      "I tried to get an XT but they sold out quickly, 9070 was going in and out of stock a lot and then I saw the price jump from £525 to £539 and they came back in stock and I said, F it, and pulled the trigger. \n\nClose enough to MSRP to be happy, like under 15 quid difference. \n\nHad been wanting a 7800 XT or 7900 GRE for a while now which the 9070 handily beats both of and if I got the XT version I would have probably had to upgrade my PSU too which I really wanted to avoid.",
      "Is there any real reason for a 9070 at 1080p/60 FPS though? I guess heavy RT content might warrant it, but I feel like you could have gotten into one of several RTX 3000 and newer models for that performance bracket.",
      "For a drastic decrease in power (what, 50%?) I believe this is an excellent tradeoff still. 11% to stay cool and silent is okay, not to mention energy bills and, oh yeah, eco friendliness.",
      "I just got a 9070. Couldn't get and XT . UK... 520 POUNDS.",
      "System runs cooler",
      "I'm just waiting for someone to randomly tell you they have a bunch at their local MicroCentre after you clearly said Singapore.",
      "I managed to grab a Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 Gaming OC from OCUK at MSRP today. Very much looking forward to receiving it. Was originally planning on getting a 4070 super but they have never come back down.\n\nIt's by far the most energy efficient 16GB card on the market."

      "> But its jot common in different sources all come to the same conclusion that Pulse is running hotter than other gpus under normal/stock defaults.\n\nwhich sources? can you link the sources, showing that the Pulse is running hotter than the Reaper?",
      "Wrong. I've personally had both at the same time, the reaper is louder and runs hotter. Both cards keep extremely low average temperatures, but the 9070 xt in general has quite high hotspot/memory temps. The pulse is slightly better at cooling the hotspot and memory than the reaper.",
      "I don't think it's anything more than a very minor aesthetic issue either way.",
      "One thing to note, as I said earlier average temps are negligible in difference, as both are more than adequately low. The main difference between the two is hotspot and memory temps where the pulse slightly outperforms.  \nMemory on pulse maxes at 84c on stock settings and reaper at 92c. Hotspot hovers around 80c at max load on the pulse (don't have hotspot max for my reaper and I no longer own the card). At idle the reaper averaged around 40c with 52c hotspot with the pulse averaging around 34c and 40c hotspot in my rig (ncase T1 v2.5).  \nI did turn off zero RPM mode on both cards, as in my case it would simply choke out the cards at idle due to the constraints of the case I built in.  \n  \nEDIT: I'd like to note one more thing, these numbers are solely from gaming and gaming benchmarks, max temperatures in synthetic benchmarks are likely higher.",

And i actually wonder why the drastic price change? The 7800 XT got a total die size of 346mm2. This is just slightly smaller than the 9070 XT's die size of 357 mm2. \n\nThis smells like AMD trying to play in the same profit ballpark as Nvidia at the expense of PC gamers once again.

Even if stuff gets re-reviewed customers do not generally look for those. \n\nLook at how RDNA2 and RDNA3 price cut over time, did it help their reputation any? Not one bit outside of niche subreddits and the mindfactory/microcenter customer bases. \n\nA bad launch review clings to a product. It also makes the assumption that Nvidia won't have stock of lower SKUs to dump into channels just to embarrass AMD. Nvidia has turned around numerous times and out-maneuvered AMD when they thought they were being clever. \n\nAMD needs to nail the launch, not play the same bullshit games they've been playing for a decade now.",

The 750 models don't actually exist.\n\n  \nCurrent MSRPs are a joke.\n\n  \nI'm fairly sure, in the current market where the local Microcenter has literally 0 gaming gpus over 400 dollars on the shelves, the 9070 xt at 700 bucks, on shelves, will sell out.

I'll be upgrading to something with more than 8 threads in the future. ",

      "With Nvidia is reported to have 90% of the discrete GPU market share, add in this apologist take towards Nvidia will do us PC gamers no good if the capitalism-backed \"competition is good\" ethos is no longer with us. \n\nActions such as rescinding support for 32-bit PhysX bears no consequences from the community for Nvidia, and i believe that's a dangerous precedent to set given it's not exactly an old technology. Further more, they have the capability to open-source it for the community to modify it. \n\nEither way, this highly competitive GPU from AMD if sold and found at MSRP will be one of many stings that would finally make Jensen Huang care about gamers again. Don't forget this 5000 series uses the same TSMC 4nm lithography as the 4000 series from two years ago, all gains are superficial and scales linearly with transistor count, cuda cores, and power consumptions, etc.",

Not to mention the QA they would need to verify it all working properly. \n\nIMO AMD should spend more time on helping devs integrate or update to FSR 3.1, so they can do the driver-sided FSR4 upgrade before the SDK releases in 2H 2025 and devs can hopefully start implementing FSR4 itself.",

      "It is loud, but as i could see the temps are very good, the hot spot around 70C. You can just adjust the fan curve and let the hot spot up to 85C like nitros. On base setting these cards are 36 dba, while nitors around 26.\n\nI am planning to buy this one, when some experience coming from the market. :D",

      "for one of the most expensive aib cards you'd expect no compromises. Cheaper options can deliver on both noise levels and temperatures",
      "I agree with the take, my copium is that maybe XFX just tuned it more aggressively for lower temps because if you look at the comparisons, the hot spot temp is a good 10-15°C lower than other models that run quieter. \n\nSo my thought is that with a custom fan curve it could all be gucci",

Sounds like you're in a car when it's moving and you have the window down. Starts happening at like 40% fan speed.\n\n  \nIt's also got terrible coil whine that gets better with undervolting to -50mV",

That's because the GPU will stall waiting for the correct data while the memory controller keeps retrying until it is able to fetch correctly. Without ECC, it just returns the garbage making the program crash if the corruption hits a sensitive data piece (or until then, you will see visual artifacts). I'm oversimplifying here, but that's the gist.\n\nIt's a great feature that avoids most data corruption, but it does make it much harder to see if your new memory settings are fine during stress tests or not.",

      "Worth mentioning, that ray tracing includes black myth wukong, which is completely broken on AMD and is basically bruteforced, so it Heavily bricks the results for ray tracing on AMD cards. It's ~5-6% better average if you exclude it (since it's a huge outlier)",
      "This. Removing the statistical anomaly or highlighting it would be helpful for a more accurate understanding.",
      "I was planning to buy an RTX 5070 but everyone on the internet told me to wait for RX 9000.\n\nI bought a Gigabyte Gaming OC RX 9070 XT for 85 USD more than the cheapest RTX 5070 in my country🙂\n\nThank you people. My RX 9070 XT demolishes the RTX 5070 where it matters. I believe the 5070 only beats it in path tracing and Black Myth Wukong.\n\nEdit : For those wondering here was my options in my terrible country (expensive GPUs, low wages, 3rd world)\n\nRTX 5070 : 85 USD cheaper than the RX 9070 XT\n\nRTX 5070ti : 195 USD more expensive than 9070 XT\n\nI'm very happy with my choice.",
      "Perhaps watch the DF video on Avatar?  It's one of the best implementations of GI and other RT features (bar the path tracing titles).\n\nIt runs well on AMD not because its RT is bad but probably because it favours AMD in raster and so when Heavy RT settings are used AMD GPU's have a bit more cushion for extra performance drop.",
      "Worth mentioning that Black myth wukong uses a specific Nvidia fork of unreal engine. Not a conspiracy to assume that Nvidia cards have primary focus on that engine.",
      "Cant buy either for sane price in Europe",
      "He's talking about Black Myth Wukong results being an outlier due to raytracing in that game being broken for AMD. Not the existence of raytracing games being an outlier.",
      "TLDR, just look at the average row for each set. It's normalized to a 5070, so if the average line for a card is 110%, that means it's 10% faster than a 5070.",
      "Test was done at very high RT. The usual usage of it, not PT level. For BMW and Alan wake it's PT, actually, that is why it is borked. In Alan wake both vendors die anyway, so having 20 fps on AMD or 25 on 5070 - who cares. Cyberpunk RT works great on both cards and that's what will be in future games.\n\nBMW on the other hand, is completely broken on AMD. Like, it's a sabotage at this point.",
      "No, but the RX 9070 XT beats the rtx 5070 (12GB) even in Ray Tracing😂 Its path tracing where it falls flat on its face, but that's a super duper tiny Sacrifice I am willing to make. \n\nThe RX 9070 XT beats the RTX 5070 in Cyberpunk at 1440p Ray Tracing Ultra preset and basically anything that isn't path tracing I believe (besides Black Myth RT)\n\nI got significantly faster raster  , a little bit faster RT and 16GB VRAM for only 85 USD more. The RTX 5070ti (16GB)  is almost 200 USD more expensive than the RX 9070 XT I bought\n\nI love this card. I just finished undervolting the card. I am getting 230w avg power usage and -3.5% perf decrease",
      "This is many number, and I many stupid…\n\nIs there a TLDR?",
      "Games that rely on RT only like Indiana Jones and Metro Exodus work well on AMD cards so IDK what that guy is talking about. Wukong just runs badly on AMD.",
      "No, the game specifically is an outlier. Cyberpunk with path tracing on all other AMD cards before this performed similarly with the 7900xtx falling behind even the 3060 Ti, but performance is much better with the 9070 and 9070XT. The 9070 XT performs on par with a 4070 in path tracing in Cyberpunk now and heavy RT results across the board are miles better than last generation... But Wukong still performs like shit.\n\n5070 is 15-20% faster in Cyberpunk PT and 73% faster in Black Myth Wukong for some reason.",
      "Same situation in Australia. These companies only care about the American market.",
      "nice",
      "how do you come to that conclusion? the 9070 is faster, the 9070xt is faster than the 4070 super.\n\nIts faster than the super and the same price (or 9070 is less).\n\nVery bad TLDR",
      "BM:W catching strays for no reason.",
      "Also don't forget access to FSR4 when choosing between 9000 and 7000 cards. It's apparently a night and day difference",
      "It's a huge outlier and statistics doesn't work that way.\n\n\nIf you keep the broken crap - the difference is 20%. If you ignore that one single crap - it's 10% or so. And that might be a very important thing for buying decision.\n\n\nSo yes, it is important to mention the outlier, so people can see that a make their decision correctly. Because in other RT games AMD is very competitive, like in cyberpunk or avatar or star wars.",
      "GNexus review kept BM:W out of the main averaging and still reported the NVIDIA as better in RT. But said 9070 XT was a good buy for MSRP."

      "While this it true nvidia historically will not touch its prices, we will only see a shift if amd is successful in clawing back the market. It’s a 90-10 split.. they have a lot of work to do.",
      "You have no real reason to consider nvidia this go round.  The average 5070ti is $900. \n\n\nEven if you're afraid to lose dlss, I wouldn't call a $300 dlss tax reasonable.",
      "9070 XT looks pretty compelling since it offers close to XTX raster and better RT performance than it, it also deals with 5070 Ti really well overall.\n\n9070 at 549$ seems like a big fail, but while customers will hate the price, one also should understand that:\n\n\\* N4 yields are very good right now, so AMD doesn't want you to get the non XT cards anymore\n\n\\* Unlike 7700 XT/7900 XT, 9070 has the same memory subsystem as the XT, so it also costs almost as much to make.",
      "There always seems to be some excuse to buy Nvidia for some people. It sometimes gets tiring having to defend my decision to buy AMD when people respond to comments questioning why the hell I didn't buy Nvidia, as if to them the idea of not automatically buying Nvidia no matter the price or usefulness of feature set is unfathomable.\n\n(in terms of gaming only, I can't speak to uses outside of that where Nvidia does perform better in other applications)",
      "If the 5070 outsells this, it's the consumers that are the problem. The 9070XT is like one and a half tiers up in terms of performance and has 4GB extra VRAM for $50 more.",
      "$599 should be around 699€ (20% tax included)",
      "Welp..  The price actually looks good.\n\nTime to strap in for another painful week while we wait for 3rd party benchmarks....\n\nLooks like I can easily dump my 3070 on Facebook marketplace for around $300.  The question remains...  Can I even get the 9070XT?  And will it really be $599?",
      "Make it 729-749€ for those above 20% (23% in my country). Meanwhile 5070ti is 900€-1000€.",
      "It’s also manufacturing, they don’t want to sell a ton of binned 9070s because their yields are good enough that they would have to artificially bin fully functioning chips to meet the demand if they sold it at a cheaper price.",
      "They also caved to the backlash of the \"4080 12GB\" and renamed it to 4070 TI with a price drop.",
      "Lol my favorite excuse is the one where they go \"yea but Nvidia has CUDA\" and when I respond and ask them \"what is CUDA and what do you use it for\" I immediately get crickets."

      "It lists Flux Schnell for 7900XTX and Flux dev only for W7900 class cards?\n\nFlux dev under WSL2 under ROCm under Comfy UI uses around 19GB VRAM in 1024x1024 and run in around 60 seconds. Under linux native people report around 45s inference time. [The catch is that it's hardcore to get ROCm to accelerate pytorch.](https://github.com/OrsoEric/HOWTO-7900XTX-Win-ROCM)\n\nI wonder if AMD were conservative with their settings, or if there is still an enormous penalty with ONNX runtime. When I tried AMUSE last time it had an incredible penality, it had around 1/20th of the performance compared even with ROCm+Zluda+Comfy UI.\n\nWhen i get around to it I'll try it.\n\nI really wish AMD picked ONE stack, and focused on that working fine. If AMD want to focus on ONNX, it's fine with me, just make that acceleration seamless, and make reliable binaries for pytorch.",

This model needs GPU + RAM.  \n\nThe Dreamshaper model looks more photorealistic by default than Flux.  A neat trick is you can add a camera save file name to the prompt to get models to output more photorealistic images.  I add DSCF1234 which is a Fuji camera image file.",

      "Yes. Just install, select a model and type what you want to see",
      "So, i gave it a go.\n\nI downloaded Amuse 3.0. Installed it and run it. I clicked on the \"expert\" button, then \"model manager\" and then i clicked on \"download model\". I chose the Stable Diffusion tab and downloaded the one named \"SD3.5 (AMDGPU)\". It's a hefty download weighing at 18.5GB. (i went to expert and try to chose a model because Amuse would prompt to download the DS3.5 Medium model and after reading a bit i realised that its output quality isn't as good as the Large model)\n\nIt's a bit slow on my 9070 XT (i guess, haven't done this again). It took almost 5 minutes to generate this image.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/m5eowavkggve1.gif\n\nEdit: That time is with 40 steps.",

      "I'm on native windows running ubuntu under WSL2\n\nAmuse is more like a windows thing. Under linux ROCm works better",
      "And this is with 100 steps and a prompt that should give a more photorealistic result.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ab8zcw4hmgve1.gif\n\nIt's a cool thing to play around.",
      "Thanks for the numbers. In case it's of use, I just tried a Flux1-schnell run with Comfy UI Zluda using the built-in workflow at 1024x1024 and it took 28.27 seconds on my 7900 XTX.",
      "I don't know anything about how AI programs are used.\n\nWill i be able to use this with ease? Is this a one-click-install with an interface i can use with my utter ignorance?",
      "It seems like a lot of people aren't too knowledgeable about locally installed image generators. Tbh, i'm not an expert myself but i've been doing a lot of testing and found out a lot of things and how it works through trial and error. I'm personally most interested in photo realistic photos it can generate. FLux and AMD SD3.5 (Large) are usually the ones providing the best results. Flux i find tends to make skins a bit too smooth, i'll still need to investigate more with that, i'm sure there's a way around it. But essentially the exact prompts you use, guidance scale, even inference steps matter a lot. Even slight changes especially in the prompt section can dramatically change the output photo. I have an AMD 9800X3D CPU, 64 GB RAM and AMD 9070 XT GPU. I will show a photo i generated below (note - quality of the image i have is a lot better than what you see, for some reason, i can only upload gifs so i had to convert it to that file which lowered the quality).\n\nYou will also notice a seed number, this number is generated at random at the end of processing the image and is kind of like a unique tag. Thankfully if you save the image, that seed number is part of the image file name. Only thing so far that i don't like about amuse is i don't believe theres a way to say the exact prompts used in the metadata of the image, or at least generate some text file. As i mentioned, seed number is important if you want to generate similar images, but if you want very similar images, you will need the seed number and also your exact prompts used. I used prompts and negative prompts to generate this image (Negative prompts are basically prompts you add to tell the model what not to generate in the image, such as blurry photos, incorrect anatomy etc.)\n\nI cannot stress enough, prompts have to be exact, even if you remove say a full stop at the end of your prompt, that will generate a slightly different image, even with the same seed number used. In other words, if i gave you my exact prompts used, Guidance level, inference steps and seed number, you will be able to generate this exact image below.  Unfortunately because it doesn't record your prompts used, or even the model used to generate the image, all this information is lost unless you record it yourself, for now i create a folder with the best images and then add a text file along with it, recording things like prompts, Guidance level, inference steps etc, so i know the exact variables i used, so if i want to go back and generate the same image and then change variables slightly to get the same image, then i have the ability to do so (the eact layout resolution you use matters too so something to remember).  seed number itself won't be enough if you want to generate images that look very close to an existing image.\n\nIf anyone has any questions, let me know and i'll try to assist.\n\n\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/lo5itzjobsve1.gif",
      "Yea I tried it, seems you can't easily load other SD models than the ones they allow you to download, and the filtering is so insane, it'll hit random prompts  and just give you a blurred mess, if it said 'detected \"X\"' or something where it could tell you why that might help, but just getting a blurred image and you having to search for why something isn't working is a bad UI experience. Meanwhile SD.Next works great.",

Risking litigation here could also potentially yield a different ruling which would make the things that end users are doing illegal as well, so with small fish assuming the risk AMD gets the benefit of having it available for the initiated and not having to stick their neck out in case Nvidia gets litigious. \n\nOther projects like ZLUDA were actually taken down at the request of AMD themselves before, citing legal concerns as the reason for their requests for removal, so it's obvious that AMD does not want to poke this bear. To that end, I'd suggest it's very unlikely that AMD would ever proceed forward with something that hooks into Nvidia's libraries to offer FSR 4, legal or not.",

My recognizing the objective state of affairs AMD is finding themselves in is not mutually exclusive of my hope that they find a way to succeed in the GPU market, I can face reality while also hoping it changes.",

I'm out here trying to make a profit. \n\nIt isn't like you ONLY pass on the cost of tariffs when you pay them. Don't you know that the executive branch can give exemptions to individuals or business unilaterally? Let's say Best Buy gets an exemption....they are still increasing the price, they are just making more profit. \n\nMaybe they have to give a kickback to the executive branch (POTUS). \n\n\nThis is how crony capitalism is born.

I'm seriously considering the Red Devil version of their 9070 XT, if I can get my hands on it, and if the price is reasonable. It has really good specs, particularly that third 8-pin power connector.

If you've recently upgraded your motherboard to one of our new X870 or recently launched B850 or B840 motherboards, you might feel like it's time to continue the AMD trend and upgrade your graphics card. \n\nFor those who are less familiar with the new cards, here are the new main features:  \n\n* The new RDNA 4 architecture  \n* 16GB GDDR6 VRAM \n* Next-gen HYPR-RX tech delivers ultra-fast gaming  \n* New AMD AI-powered technologies, including an improved experience with ray-tracing. \n* Machine-learning based super resolution mode compatible with select FSR 3.1 games provide an incredible balance of detailed images and fluid frame rates. \n* DisplayPort 2.1 outputs give users massive bandwidth for going big on resolution while supporting high-end refresh rates \n\nOn the ASUS side, we've implemented a number of new changes to our cooling design, PCB design, and optional software:\n\n**Phase-Change Thermal Pads Provide a Long-Lasting Cooling Experience** \n\nOne new change for our graphics cards this year is that we're switching from standard thermal paste used on the GPU and thermal module to phase-change thermal pads. \n\nWhen transferring heat, the electrically non-conductive pad is a solid at room temperature but liquifies as it heats up. As it melts, it fills the microscopic gaps between the GPU and thermal module, providing superior thermal conductivity and enhanced heat dissipation, ensuring optimal performance, even for sustained, heavy GPU workloads.   \n\nAdditionally, the phase-change thermal pads offer exceptional longevity. They outlast traditional pastes by a significant margin, even for graphics cards that see heavy workloads on a regular basis.  \n\n**ASUS GPU Tweak III Software** \\- Some gamers prefer to tune their graphics cards for all-out performance, while others insist on quiet operation. A physical Dual BIOS switch lets users choose between performance and quiet modes without installing additional software. For more performance-tuning options, easy hardware monitoring and granular control of fan behavior, users can download the free ASUS GPU Tweak III software. \n\n**ASUS GPU Guard & Bracket\\*** \\- ASUS GPU Guard applies adhesive to secure all four corners to reduce the risk of cracks, while a GPU bracket helps ensure uniform mounting pressure and extra stability. \n\n**Protective PCB Coating\\*** \\- A protective conformal coating envelops the circuit board to help protect against short-circuits caused by moisture, dust or debris. \n\n\\*Available only on the TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 cards \n\n**TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition and TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4zxtc3j5nvle1.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12bb410662c4cb748df61dacfc3650076364fd11\n\nTUF Gaming graphics cards utilize an unassuming style that fits in easily with just about any components on the market. For the TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, ASUS has retained the classic ruggedized aesthetic of the series. An illuminated TUF Gaming logo on the corner of the card provides a touch of personalization, and it supports ASUS Aura Sync so users can coordinate its lighting with the rest of their compatible gear. \n\nThe TUF Gaming design for this series delves deep into the standard excellent cooling that a TUF Gaming card provides and makes sure that gamers are well equipped in case they want to adjust their cooling or performance characteristics.  \n\nThese cards sport the typical metal exoskeleton for structural rigidity that the TUF Gaming cards are known for. Wide vents on the aluminum backplate allow heat to exhaust into the main airflow channel of your chassis. It wouldn't be a TUF Gaming card if it didn't include military-grade components for solid power delivery and long lifespan, or a PCB coating to protect it against short-circuits caused by moisture, dust, or debris.  \n\nTUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 cards feature: \n\n* 3.125-slot design with a vented exoskeleton and massive fin array optimized for airflow from three Axial-tech fans \n* Three eleven-blade Axial-tech fans maintain a steady high-pressure stream of cooling through a massive airflow-optimized fin array.  \n* Dual-ball fan bearings last up to twice as long as conventional sleeve-bearing designs. \n* 0dB technology allows the fans to turn off at low workloads and effectively become silent. \n* Dual BIOS switch to toggle between Performance and Quiet BIOS profiles. \n* ASUS GPU Guard and bracket secure the GPU, reducing the risk of cracks and ensuring stable mounting \n* Subtle RGB lighting on the TUF Gaming logo on the corner of the card can be configured through Aura Sync \n* GPU Tweak III software is free to monitor and configure your graphics card. The software now integrates the HW Info plug-in so you can keep an eye on your graphics card and just about anything else in your system. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bl4k27m3nvle1.jpg?width=7344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d3dabfa8757cbdf56a0956b720844daa9aae3c0\n\n**Pricing and Availability -** \n\nPricing – \n\n* TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition 16GB GDDR6 - $799.99\n* TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition 16GB GDDR6 - $709.99\n\nAvailability – On-Shelf March 6 at 6AM PT \n\nProduct Page -  \n\n* TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition 16GB GDDR6 - [https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070xt-o16g-gaming/](https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070xt-o16g-gaming/) \n* TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition 16GB GDDR6 - [https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070-o16g-gaming/](https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/tuf-gaming/tuf-rx9070-o16g-gaming/) \n\n**ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition and Prime Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl3o6xsmnvle1.jpg?width=7667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a22553134cc5d2da72fe23dcaf8c3c3da05ef4ee\n\nASUS Prime graphics cards were a new addition to our lineup last year. Packing performance and cooling into a compact 2.5 slot frame, these cards help ensure compatibility with more cases. Building a card this size that can handle the demands of long hours of gaming requires attention to a number of important details. \n\nTo make sure they offer excellent cooling performance compatible with a number of compact cases, Prime series cards use three Axial-tech fans, similar to the fans we use on our top-end graphics cards - but use a smaller fan hub that allows for longer fan blades. We then surround the fans in a barrier ring to increase downward pressure. The card also features: \n\n* Dual-ball fan bearings last up to twice as long as conventional sleeve-bearing designs. \n* 0dB technology to turn the fans off below 50C, and turn the fans back on at 55C with a speed curve optimized for cooling and noise. \n* Phase-change GPU thermal pads for optimal heat transfer and long-term reliability. \n* 2.5-slot design allows for greater build compatibility while maintaining cooling performance \n* Dual-BIOS switch that allows you to switch fan profiles between Performance and Quiet BIOS profiles. \n* Aluminum protective backplate to protect the card and provide structural integrity \n* GPU Tweak III software is free to monitor and configure your graphics card. The software now integrates the HW Info plug-in so you can keep an eye on your graphics card and just about anything else in your system. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qm8x0o43ovle1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3638dcb9517bb2e28579474545c0b38d415acbe\n\n**Pricing and Availability -** \n\nPricing – \n\n* ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition - $719.99\n* ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition - $659.99\n\nAvailability – On-Shelf March 6 at 6AM PT \n\nProduct Page -  \n\n* ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition - [https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9070xt-o16g/](https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9070xt-o16g/) \n* ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition - [https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9070-o16g/](https://asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9070-o16g/) \n\nFAQ - \n\nQ. Will there be other models than TUF Gaming and Prime?  \nA. No plans to offer additional models at this time.\n\nQ. Where will we be able to purchase these cards?  \nA.

      "Fair enough, but the pricing isn't available for me to post yet. The post will be updated as soon as I receive it.",
      "You forgot to add the ASUS tax. They haven't posted the pricing yet because they're still trying to figure out what they can get away with.",
      "LMAO price TBD, so with an MSRP $150 cheaper than the 5070 ti, watch all the AIBs fuck this up and price the 9070 XT similar to the prices of 5070 ti at $800 +",
      "With Asus antics with the 50 series cards. I'll not be buying any cards from Asus.\n\n\nThey are one of the reasons everything is so inflated.",

      "If it's the usual Asus outrageously above MSRP we'll just buy another brand. You think you can at least keep these reasonably priced?",

      "What's the advantage of GPU Tweak III when I can do the tweaking in the actual AMD Adrenaline software?",
      "They don't receive the GPUs at MSRP lol. They receive them cheaper so they can sell them at MSRP, unless it's some special edition.",
      "Asus won’t charge this price. They have to worry about materials+R&D for their own coolers, overclocks, etc.",
      "bro, but the offer code discount! /s",
      "have you looked at the 5000 series prices?  theyre charging almost +75% for the 5090 astral LC cards ($3400).  asus pricing for this gen are out of this world.",

      "In fairness, our ProArt designs make a lot of products look like they could use some improvement, so I understand where you're coming from there.",
      "True, they're the ones that ended up in the \"is it an MSRP model or not?\" mess before the 5070 Ti launched.",
      "No Strix, no Asus.",
      "why u wanna pay abhorrent prices for maybe 1% extra performance?",

      "Not op but I had a 7800xt and I sold it because at 1440p It was bottlenecking my fps in my favorite game rn which is helldivers 2. When I upgraded, my cpu is now the bottleneck (5800x3d). I actually\nUsed to get occasional frame hitching on my 7800xt but now it’s completely gone with the new card",
      "I just did a similar update except I already had my GPU and it was worth it. Selling off the old AM4 parts will recoup cost.",
      "That's probably in like another 3 years though.",
      "honestly the CPU upgrade IS worth it since the 9800X3D is just *that* good\n\nwait, do 40 series GPU's go for MSRP used? that's insane",
      "I went from zen 2 (3900x) to zen 4 x3d (7950x3d) huge jump for me without a GPU upgrade for productivity.",
      "I've noticed a very big difference going 5800X3D to 9800X3D don't forget the change is also moving from DDR4 to DDR5. You are also looking at like a 40% increase in Single threaded performance.",
      "If he sells the CPU, GPU and motherboard he will probably make up for most of what he spent on the upgrade. 40 series GPU's go for about MSRP right now and the 5800x3d is about $300. Good X570 boards also sell for a pretty penny as well",
      "Makes sense, I noticed a lot of improvement going strictly from 6900 XT to 9070 XT.  Still on the 5800 X3D.",
      "I did 6800xt to 7900xtx which was about a 50% performance improvement and should be similar with your jump i felt that also on the 5800X3D it was nice.",
      "I guess that would depend on how long you've been due for an upgrade? Can you play the games you want to play or basically use your computer the way you want to? I'm upgrading after like 7-8 years.",
      "Awesome dude! I did something very similar.  Sold my 5700x3d 4070super mini itx pc for $250 more than it cost me to build 5 months ago and just built a mini itx am5 ryzen 7500f with 9070xt for Less than what I sold my old pc for.",
      "tbh i mostly meant the GPU in OP's case, pretty much anything that isn't a 7800X3D is worth upgrading to a 9800X3D given the latters performance hardly even bottlenecks a 5090",
      "So I was actually thinking about switching to AM5 in the next couple months; Is that gonna be worth my time/investment if AM6 is three years out? Should I just wait? I very rarely make huge upgrades to my rig beyond switching out GPU, RAM, etc. A new motherboard and processor is a big purchase for me.",

      "And of course, the real reason is because $700+ for a 9070 and $800+ for a 9070 XT is still gonna be sold out for months.\n\nThe biggest issue is that B100 is sold out through 2025 and beyond and it uses the same die space/node process (IIRC) as a 5090.\n\nShort of Nvidia or AMD releasing some kind of 3nm refresh of their cards this year that doesn't ALSO slam into a different datacenter AI card (or a metric truckload of Apple orders), I'm not sure we have a good solution for this problem. Everyone is fighting for the same die space and one use case has 10-30x the retail value as the others.",
      "I think its because for as much as they can make on the low end, the high end is where the biggest profit margins are. For every $2000 card they sell it probably brings in more money than 10 $400 cards do. And since scalpers will always buy stuff up to resell for more, they dont care. I think eventually this won't be able to be sustained, and we will see a considerable readjustment. But while the money is flowing, they will keep selling at these huge prices."

Or is this just a tactic to break into the Chinese market, which is far more intertwined with Nvidia than the rest of the world? \n\nIt doesn’t make sense either; Nvidia isn’t supplying enough stock, and AMD would sell out just as easily there.",
      "I assume that, at some point, the market will be saturated with the Radeon RX 9070/9070 XT.\n\nAMD can then sell the Radeon RX 9070 GRE as the cheaper equivalent to the GeForce RTX 5070.",

      "I mean, the 7900GRE got a lot of mindshare, it makes sense for them to keep the name",
      "It's about cutting down the memory controller too when damaged.  Those defective dies get to be reused and return a profit instead of thrown away into into the silicon recycling bin.  This has been done with so many generations now I don't understand how you think this is anything new.",
      "Instead however AMD changed it to mean \"Great Radeon Edition\" Instead, no joke, that's what they did to justify keeping GRE naming.",

      "I don't think it's as far as people fear. The Micro Center closest to me (3+ hours away) went through all of its hundreds of 9070 cards at launch. There was one model that restocked about half a dozen units a couple of weeks ago, and they lasted at least a few hours.\n\nThis week, XFX restocked a couple of their models, which are all unbelievably overpriced (starts at $830). The 6 cards they got in ($850 Swifts in white) didn't even sell out. 5 of them moved that first day. The next day, the site listed that last Swift and 1 Quicksilver ($890, also in white) in stock. Those TWO cards lasted most of the day.\n\nIt's clear that the demand for these overpriced models has already diminished notably. Even some of the $700-750 models aren't disappearing from online restocks immediately, and there are some of those crappy Newegg bundles that last 1-2 days.",

Don’t think a single 9070 XT has been sold so far and stock is there. 3 of my friends so far bought 5070 Ti over 9070 XT.",

I'm thinking maybe you're the dishonest one and just being a pedantic contrarian because it's the only way you can find anything to say.",
      "They're great cards at $600 but I'd pick a 5070ti if it's within $100 of the 9070XT.  A case can be made for the $700-$750 models but I don't think the $800+ models make sense."
