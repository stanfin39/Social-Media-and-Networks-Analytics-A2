      "Artificial intelligence models need tons of VRAM.  Nvidia gives pro AI cards lots of VRAM, but charges super high prices for them.\n\nIn contrast, consumer cards come with less VRAM, to discourage AI researchers from buying consumer cards to run their models on.\n\nThat hasn't stopped some less-well-funded AI researchers from doing so anyway.  If you search old threads here, you will find anecdotes about how less-well-funded AI researchers bought consumer GPUs in lieu of pro cards.\n\nNvidia doesn't like this.\n\nIf AI demand falls, Nvidia would presumably be more willing to give consumer cards more VRAM.  Until then, gamers are not a priority. 88% of their revenue and probably well over 90% of their profit comes from data center GPUs.",

      "The fact that the equivalent card from 2025 has only 2gb more VRAM than my 1060 from 2016, 9 fucking years ago, is a fucking crime. This is what lack of competition does to an industry.",
      "Nvidia keeps doing this. Ffs, only reason I use them is for CUDA and Nvenc. At this point I'm gonna be looking at AMD or Intel if the 5070 doesn't have more than 16 at a price that makes sense.",
      "It's called Fiduciary duty..... Any card that the GPU is strong enough to actually last 5 years will be limited by Vram thus getting the consumer to upgrade sooner. \n\nThis is why I hope and pray Intel is working on a B770 card.",

Read here!\n\n**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**\n\nThere is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that‚Äôs if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what‚Äôs going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).\n\n**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**\n\n**Common Troubleshooting Steps**\n\n* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11\n* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.\n* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance\n\nIf it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:\n\n* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.\n* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it‚Äôs difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.\n* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.\n\nIf you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.\n\n**Common Questions**\n\n* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there‚Äôs no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*\n\n**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**\n\n* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*\n* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*\n* **What does the new Power Management option ‚ÄúOptimal Power‚Äù means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*\n\nRemember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.",

      "I don't think I have ever seen these many bug fixes in a Nvidia driver in my almost 10 years of using nvidia hardware. This really shows just how unfinished their drivers were in the 572 series and they still went ahead with it. Games being broken on day 1 is one thing, drivers being broken can cause many non-gaming issues as well.",

      "PSA: These drivers might stop reporting GPU temperature after waking the PC from sleep. Read this!\n\n\\--\n\nNote: This does not affect people using factory curves. Or people that doesn't use MSIAB or any other fan control tool (FanControl, Argus)\n\nThis affects users with custom curves in MSIAB, and/or users who control case fans using fan control software (FanControl, Argus)\n\n\\---\n\nUpdate (I wasn't aware): I was informed \"Restating\" driver via WIN+CTRL+SHIFT+B doesn't really restart the driver (that explains why it was never a solution to any issue I found in the past).\n\nTo quickly restart the driver, use \"restart64.exe\" which comes with CRU.\n\nThank you, guys, for that vital piece of info!... and yes, using \"restart64.exe\" makes the GPU report temps again. (No need to toggle \"Manage GPU Performance Counters\").\n\n\\--\n\nAfter waking the PC from sleep, temp readings in MSIAB stopped working. I was not aware and that made my GPU go all the way to my set max 85c and my GPU was throttling to keep the temps down because the fans (custom curve) never ramped up.\n\nTested it twice and is reproducible.\n\nThe solution for now is to run \"restart64.exe\" to restart the driver.\n\n**Steps to reproduce (sent to NV already).**\n\n\\- After installing 576.02 and rebooting.\n\n\\- Make sure the temp reading in MSIAB works.\n\n\\- Put the PC to sleep.\n\n\\- Wake the PC up.\n\n\\- Check in MSIAB. The temp sensors stop reporting.\n\n\\- Run \"restart64.exe\". The driver will restart.\n\n\\- Check MSIAB, you'll see the temps working again. (no need to restart MSIAB during any of these steps).\n\n\\- Repeat Sleep/wake up.\n\n\\- MSIAB temps stop again.\n\n~~-~~ Run \"restart64.exe\"\n\n\\- MSIAB report temps again.\n\nThank me later.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised NV quickly releases a hotfix for this.\n\nAfter 2 days.

In other words, it already has worse average performance, and that‚Äôs **before** you have to deal with VRAM stutters.\n\nDespite the headlines and clickbait, the thesis is still sound: **do not buy the 8GB model**, especially if you enable all the RTX features like Nvidia really wants you to.",

      "This has already been the case for many years.  Many games do target what they believe the majority of consumers have for PC hardware.  You can clearly see a lot of people on Steam have GPUs that have 8GB or even less of VRAM.  It does appear a lot of people do have 12GB cards too.  So 8-12GB is where we are... But if you buy something right now and want it to last... 16GB as the video here recommends is pretty good advice.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/"

Wholesale VRAM chips are like a few dollars each. 5060 ti with almost 3080's performance with only 8GB of VRAM is clearly planned obsolescence.\n\nEdit: it's not even planned obsolescence it's worse.

      "But we are now past the point where 8gb is enough for 1440p/high settings in all games. Some of the most demanding new games even want more than 8gb for 1080p/high nowadays.\n\n8gb cards are not useless, and if you have one you can very likely get a good enough experience with it if you are willing to trim back the texture\nBut that's a very different question then whether or not it makes sense to pay hundreds of dollars for a new 8gb card now. That's where the 5060/ti 8gb just feel like a bad idea.",
      "VRAM is that expensive?",
      "I have to wonder if the 8 GB is truly core-identical to the 16 GB aside from the VRAM. nVidia has pulled this trick before where the GTX 1060 3 GB was *not* core-identical to the GTX 1060 6 GB, and the RTX 3060 8 GB and the 6 GB variants are not 100% 1:1 with the 12 GB: https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-3060-8-gb.c3937 and https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-3060-mobile.c3757 (Interestingly the laptop aka 6 GB variant actually has more of some units than the desktop variant, which suggests nVidia was trying to compensate for the lack of VRAM by adding compute power).",

Most people who buy lower end cards like to hold onto them for 4-5 years. Good luck in 2030 with 8GB of VRAM, probably gonna be like 2GB today given we expect a ps6 in 2027-2028..."

    "selftext": "From NVIDIA Article: [Click Here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/doom-the-dark-ages-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-out-now)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qrptcalasj0f1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=6959b1d68500d91a4ebe11bf623b0a82f83d470e\n\nThe long-awaited, much-anticipated *DOOM: The Dark Ages* has received universal acclaim from reviewers, and is now available in Early Access for those who purchased the Premium Edition or our [GeForce RTX 50 Series bundle](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/doom-the-dark-ages-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpu-and-laptop-bundle)! Witness the creation of a legend as the Slayer takes on all of Hell and turns the tide of the war, now or on May 15th when *DOOM: The Dark Ages* launches globally, enhanced by RTX technology.\n\nGeForce RTX gamers will receive the definitive *DOOM: The Dark Ages* experience thanks to our technical partnership with id Software. Multiply frame rates on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs on average by 4X at 4K using [DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/). Double performance on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs using DLSS Frame Generation, and enhance image quality on all GeForce RTX GPUs with DLSS Super Resolution‚Äôs transformer AI model.\n\nAccelerate *DOOM: The Dark Ages*‚Äô native idTech8 ray tracing technologies with GeForce RTX Ray Tracing Cores. Make gameplay even more responsive with NVIDIA Reflex. Shortly after launch, an update will introduce PC-exclusive path tracing, taking ray traced lighting to the next level on GeForce RTX GPUs thanks to DLSS Ray Reconstruction, which replaces traditional denoisers with a superior, unified AI model that enhances image quality and accelerates performance.\n\nBelow is a new, exclusive video showing you the day-one *DOOM: The Dark Ages* experience on a GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU, using Ultra settings, Reflex, and DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation\n\n[Video Link Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3q8taqRiGQ)\n\n# DOOM: The Dark Ages Is RTX ON\n\nDeveloped on the all-new idTech8 engine, *DOOM: The Dark Ages* runs natively in ray traced mode, rendering more immersive and spectacular scenes which feature full dynamic lighting with Ray-Traced Global Illumination and Ray-Traced Reflections.\n\nRay-traced global illumination lighting simulates real-world lighting to naturally illuminate and darken detail, and enables real-time lighting changes based on the properties of light cast from all light sources, and from dynamic elements, such as player and enemy weapons.\n\nRay-traced reflections, meanwhile, enhance suitably reflective surfaces, enabling them to mirror their surroundings, or to be more naturally shaded and illuminated, increasing image quality.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcjrbb6vij0f1.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&s=399a2218f6c4013dcfbde2f62cd3fdb4f0bd5ed6\n\n**Shortly after launch, a PC-exclusive** ***DOOM: The Dark Ages*** **update will add path tracing and DLSS Ray Reconstruction.**\n\n**Path tracing takes the quality of ray-traced lighting to the next level, reflecting additional detail and game elements on surfaces. NVIDIA Spatial Hash Radiance Cache (SHaRC) technology is leveraged to performantly compute path-traced light, while NVIDIA Shader Execution Reordering further accelerates performance on GeForce RTX GPUs.**\n\nTo ensure path tracing looks its absolute best, traditional denoisers are replaced on GeForce RTX GPUs with [DLSS Ray Reconstruction](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction/). This AI-based technique produces higher-quality images, with more detail, and greater stability, improving overall image quality.\n\nUsed synergistically, path tracing and DLSS Ray Reconstruction make *DOOM: The Dark Ages* levels more immersive, and its action more spectacular, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive experience.\n\n# DLSS 4 With Multi Frame Generation Multiplies Frame Rates\n\nGeForce RTX gamers cranking *DOOM: The Dark Ages*‚Äô settings to the max can enable NVIDIA DLSS to ensure frame rates are at their fastest at each resolution.\n\nOur newest DLSS innovation, Multi Frame Generation, generates three additional frames per traditional frame, multiplying performance significantly, for the fastest gaming possible at the highest resolutions and detail levels.\n\nIn *DOOM: The Dark Ages*, in conjunction with DLSS Super Resolution, [DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/) accelerates performance by an average of 4X at 4K on the Ultra Preset. This massive boost enables GeForce RTX 5090 owners to experience *DOOM: The Dark Ages* maxed out at over 320 frames per second, GeForce RTX 5080 players at over 240 FPS, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti users at over 210 FPS, and GeForce RTX 5070 owners at over 170 FPS.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwvymc3zrj0f1.png?width=6666&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddb61c2303b9411caddf8a5ec61c007cd124c460\n\nAt 2560x1440, a 3.2X average performance multiplier enables high frame rate, max setting *DOOM: The Dark Ages* gameplay on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, ranging from over 180 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, up to 390 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5090.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yw5cselzrj0f1.png?width=6666&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd9b90ac9eb126adb278b86e12bd9ecfb5a5ae48\n\nAt 1920x1080, a 3.1X DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation multiplier ensures every GeForce RTX 50 Series gamer can experience *DOOM: The Dark Ages* maxed out at over 250 frames per second, and at up to 470 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5090.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d63x8i50sj0f1.png?width=6666&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfbabfc242f030ed430bdcc6c1120d1d0d4ce3e9\n\n***Gamers on RTX 50 Series with 8GB GPUs can enjoy DOOM: The Dark Ages at Ultra settings with high frame rates by setting \"Texture Pool Size\" to 1536 with minimal impact to image quality.***\n\nA similarly fast experience can be found on our newest GeForce RTX 50 Series laptops at 2560x1600 thanks to a 3.8X average DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation performance multiplier, enabling max setting gameplay at up to 270 frames per second on a mobile machine.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jho32t41sj0f1.png?width=6666&format=png&auto=webp&s=1887a7617b3f40f46fcd0a49789a7c7b06c302c3\n\nAt 1920x1080, a 3.3X average increase sees performance on GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPUs surpass 200 frames per second, and reaches 360 FPS on GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPUs, for a super fast mobile gaming experience.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pq2paal1sj0f1.png?width=6666&format=png&auto=webp&s=d61b6a362b5363997674ca0e469e72f61bb51729\n\nHigh frame rates reduce [PC latency](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/system-latency-optimization-guide/), making gameplay more responsive. To reduce latency even further, all GeForce RTX gamers can activate [NVIDIA Reflex](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/reflex/) in *DOOM: The Dark Ages*. This game-changing technology reduces PC latency on GeForce graphics cards, desktops, and laptops so your actions occur quicker, making games even more responsive, and more enjoyable.\n\nUsing DLSS and Reflex, *DOOM: The Dark Ages* is at its fastest and most responsive on GeForce RTX GPUs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wczod582sj0f1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=b36c888c28f2ee94a777b63bc3661687ac3eed7d\n\n# DOOM: The Dark Ages Game Ready Driver Available Now\n\nTo get your system game ready for *DOOM: The Dark Ages*, head to the Drivers tab of [NVIDIA app](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/) or [GeForce.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/) to download and install our [*DOOM: The Dark Ages* Game Ready Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/doom-the-dark-ages-geforce-game-ready-driver).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbzq416qjj0f1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9ee0fdbe48967f0d8ce6bb77fe5cf6ce6d092c1\n\n# GeForce RTX 50 Series Bundle Available Until May 21st\n\nUntil May 21st, as part of our [*DOOM: The Dark Ages* GeForce RTX 50 Series Bundle](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/doom-the-dark-ages-rtx-bundle/)\\*, get the Premium Edition of *DOOM: The Dark Ages* (a $99.99 value) with the purchase of a qualifying GeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, or 5070 desktop or graphics card, or a laptop with a GeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, or 5070 Laptop GPU.\n\nGet a head start on slaying demons with the Premium Edition, including up to 2-Day Early Access\\*\\* and the campaign DLC\\*\\*\\*.

      "The 16GB variant will definitely be a nice card to have, perfectly adequate for 1440p since it will get much higher bandwidth than 4060 Ti and full DLSS support (I mean enough memory for FG), the only problem will be the price - I don't expect Leather Jacket to sell it below 499$ considering how stingy he is with the vRAM.",
      "This business model is just stupid. 70 class should always have more VRAM than 60ti class.",
      "Given the scaling of the 5070 versus last-gen, I could easily see the 5060 Ti basically being a 4070 with up to 16GB of VRAM, which if priced well could be decent.  But it's 2025 so it probably won't be priced well.",
      "The 5070 is 550$, I just can't see this being priced at 500$, it's going to be 450$ but ofcourse nobody would get it at that price.",
      "Honestly hobby AI is rapidly advancing that you want at least 32-48GB now.\n\nPeople who are running AI at 16GB know how painfully slow and limited it is.\n\nThere's a reason why workstation class or better GPUs are like 96-128GB starting. Ain't no way you're putting a 500B model on these, and distilling that shit down with quants compromises quality.",
      "They have done this since 3060 brother. Overcharging for vram on low end cards is their business now.",
      "That doesn't really matter.  The 4070 has either 480 or 504 GB/s depending on the model, the 5060 Ti will have 448 GB/s.\n\nBut, nearly every 50-series card I've seen can do +2000 on the memory, which would take the 5060 Ti to 512 GB/s.",

On paper looks like small upgrade over 4060ti.\n(10%)\n\n\nI am not personally happy with it because i expected that they will bring more raytracing performance to users to make it more mainstream.\nSo i would like to see minimum¬† 4070 level.\n\n\n\n\nPs.

[https://github.com/dartraiden/NVIDIA-patcher/issues/221](https://github.com/dartraiden/NVIDIA-patcher/issues/221)\n\nIt says:\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nInstall driver version 460.89:  \nThis driver supports the VK\\_KHR\\_ray\\_query extension at the software level. game shortcut properties  \n\"C:\\\\Games\\\\IndianaJones\\\\IndianaJones.exe\" +r\\_raytracing 0 +r\\_renderAPI 1 +r\\_forceMinimalVulkanFeatures 1\n\nGo to the folder where the game settings files are stored.  \nr\\_raytracing 1 Change the value to:  \nr\\_raytracing 0\n\nor  \nTo emulate Vulkan extensions, you can use tools like the LunarG Vulkan SDK\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nI think this is big, since perhaps other ray tracing exclusive games could also work on GTX GPUs. While I have an RTX card, I have a sibling with a 1080 Ti, so maybe this could be big for them, and maybe games like Doom Dark Ages can work this way too. This could also help hold some people over while they wait for a reasonably price 22GB+ GPU to upgrade to, since Nvidia's current offerings are mostly vram starved at 12-16GB (except for 5060 Ti 16GB, which is actually the perfect amount for that card)",

      ">but at least the games boot\n\nThat's not a positive point lol. It boots then what? Do you suggest people try to enjoy the (likely) sub 10 FPS slideshow on their 7+ years old card?",
      "There are no GPUs bottlenecked with 16GB of RAM unless you're trying to fully path trace a game at 4k and 60fps. My 4080 has never once been ram limited. \n\nWaiting over ten years to upgrade your card is a personal choice, but it's not reasonable to expect new games to run well on it or to run at all.",
      "Presumably, one of two things will happen\n\nA) Light sources remain intact, but many areas will be pitch black because of the lack of bounce light and emissive light, those are both impossible in rasterization\n\nB) Everything is fullbright (more likely than A)",
      "Someone like DF has to go investigate this, check performance and visuals etc. Basically...is it worth it? Its supposed to be a ray tracing only game right? So if you disable all the ray tracing stuff, does it look really shitty?",
      "You're going to wait a loooooong time. Also newsflash ram=/=performance. Reddit brainwashed you into thinking that.",
      "Yeah. It's always been a thing, and it's never been worth it.",
      "I believe Cyberpunk can enable RT on a GTX 1660 Ti, I remember seeing a video a few years ago of it and it ran at single digital framerate.",
      "11GB VRAM does not give it reasonable performance. 1080Ti is beaten by a 2060 with DLSS today @ 6GB VRAM. Any card today is basically a huge generational leap from 1080Ti.\n\nAnd 16GB is perfectly fine for future -- you may surprisingly find pure RT games use less VRAM than raster due to less by-product for deferred rendering. Future AI driven texture compression will further reduce the VRAM usage by a lot.",
      "Allocation != Consumption\n\nBlack Ops 6 takes up 98% of my 5090‚Äôs 32GB, does it need that much? Fuck no\n\nRDR2 at 4k max allocates 11GB, again does it need that? Nope\n\nThere is no way to know how much vram a game needs unless there‚Äôs an in game consumption bar or you really start notice stuttering and your GPU‚Äôs memory is maxed out.",
      "MSI Afterburner? That‚Äôs allocation‚Ä¶\n\nUnless the game tells you how much it‚Äôs actually using its allocation.",
      "It's not \"forced\" rt. It's just rt, the technique they use that's been available since 2018 on PC GPUs. But no, rasteirzed doesn't look bad, especially if baked properly. It's just not as accurate.",
      "Because money?",
      "what game refuses to run on a 3060 Ti?\n\nyou can run Indiana Jones if you turn down Texture Pool Size\n\nyou mentioned turning down settings and resolution for compute... well you can do the same thing with Texture Quality/Pool",

TWO generations of XX60Ti don't even give the same uplift as ONE generation did before this.\n\n* 4060Ti is a coin toss between whether it even beats the 3060Ti  for any given game.

Stalker 2 for instance on Xbox Series X Performance Mode (yes performance mode as in with a 60 FPS target) runs at 1152p on the high end with dynamic resolution scaling, so it can also go as low as 864p and often goes there because it cannot run at even 1440p reliably at 60 FPS.

Let that simmer in your mind.\n\n> the games don't crash because they run out of VRAM.\n\nThats because the devs know the configuration of the consoles and optimise their game to fit within the RAM requirements of the console. PC devs don't have that liberty, they can try and fit within an 8GB VRAM buffer if they want to, but they can't assure that every configuration will work as intended like they can for consoles because there's not one or two set configurations/consoles to build toward.\n\n> The industry moving forward is not \"my own standard\".

You're just upset.",

The card needs to perform in RT, where the performance loss is over 80% in some cases, and needs to be able to at least make some use of the software features it includes in the price tag, DLSS and framegen among them. Combine those with the VRAM at full blast, and you have a 400 USD GT 710.\n\nWhat if instead we get NVIDIA to not release overpriced garbage with specs that make the product obsolete at release? Consoles dictated that 12GB are needed for more than a few weeks now, time to get mid end products on par.\n\nPlanned obsolescence used to mean \"last a while\", now it's useless at release.",

      "if it was 100 less it'd be a good card lol",
      "It's all about price, it seems like an average card but the 8gb one is ridiculous at the price point, just needs to be removed from the stack at this point and offer 12gb + across the board (more ideally 16gb) for this price region.\n\n\nMSRP is worthless these days as well sadly so reviewing is difficult as the context is changing, saying a card is good or bad typically hinges on where it is priced against the competition.",
      "Reddit told me it's the worst card of all time",
      "About a year ago people were telling us we were wrong about 8GB being too little VRAM. So now reviewers finally agree that 8GB is too low and they suggest a 12GB card. How long will that last?",
      "> and they suggest a 12GB card\n\nThe very same card which nVidia crippled on purpose, because they knew it offered the best price/perf ratio üòí",
      "2060 Super was between 1070Ti and 1080.  \n3060Ti was roughly equivalent to 2080 or 2080 Super.  \n5060Ti is very far from 4080 or even 4070Ti. It's worse than a 4070.",
      "I think reviewers gotta realize that not everyone wants to or has the money to spend up. So instead they spend down and accept their fate.",
      "Not the worst, but it‚Äôs still pretty underwhelming. They say it‚Äôs a decent uplift of about 15-20% from the previous gen, but you‚Äôre comparing it to the wet noodle that was the 4060ti, which couldn‚Äôt decide if it was a 10% uplift over the 3060ti or slightly behind it when it‚Äôs crippled bandwidth started making an impact on performance. It‚Äôs even more amusing realizing the 3080, a 4 year old card mind you, is still beating the 5060ti in rasterized performance. \n\nPoint is, people are a bit excited at the fact it has 16gb of vram and isn‚Äôt gonna cost another $100 more than the 8gb model, but that‚Äôs still a big *if*, considering there is no FE model for AIBs to base the price around.",
      "What was the historical uplift? Say 1060 to 2060 to 3060?",

      "Man, the 3060ti was crazy good value if not for the ridiculous 8GB of vram.\n\n\nI would not have upgraded to a 5070 if it was not the case.",
      "Honest question, do people still expect like 30-40% uplift every generation? The chip hasn't changed much at all from 40 to 50 series. Besides, most people don't upgrade gen to gen, so even the it's 15-20% better doesn't matter because people are comparing from multiple gens back sometimes.",
      "For Reddit any NVIDIA card is the worst of all time.",
      "Depends what time period you include historically.  20 years ago, generation to generation jumps were much bigger.  Partly because they were starting out with much more constrained designs that were easier to improve on, and partly because the fabrication was doing better with scaling from generation to generation.  But no matter how you approach the data, this is a small jump.  Historically, it probably would have been called a small die shrink and this would have been the \"X50\" -> \"X50, Upgraded Edition\" rather than the \"Y50.\"  It's really only being marketing as a whole new generation of the product line because the marketing department figures we are due for a new generation.\n\nThe 1600 series and RTX2000 launched on 12nm (at TSMC).\n\nRTX 3000 was 8nm (but manufactured at Samsung, so not directly comparable)\n\nRTX 4000 was 4nm (Back to TSMC)\n\nRTX 5000 is on a slightly different/newer process node at TSMC but still advertised at \"4nm.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nvidia_graphics_processing_units#RTX_50_series\n\nSo they underlying manufacturing technology hasn't had a generational jump this time.  That limits how much new stuff NV can pack into the design.  They get a few percent from improved design, and a few percent from refinements in the manufacturing process.  But in ye Oelden days of advanced CPU/GPU product lines, something advertised as a whole new generation of the product line would typically happen when manufacturing tech could cram about 2x as many parts onto a chip, so you would expect to get >2x the performance generation to generation rather than like 20%.  Since modern manufacturing is already counting individual atoms in numbers you could keep track of on your fingers when laying down layers of material, there's a lot less \"low hanging fruit\" to improve on these days.  Whatever they release as the \"RTX 6000 series\" will probably be the sort of improvement over the 4000 series that folks were hoping for, with all the manufacturing process improvements that weren't ready for this product cycle.",
      "It feels like pricing and naming/positioning, is what many criticism boils down in reality. Not just for this card but some others. If some of these cards didn't have its name/position and the price to match that name/position, they might be much better regarded.",
      "Gen to gen it is. Price to perfrmance it is ok",
      ">they knew it offered the best price/perf ratio\n\nThis metric is not used in NV headquarters."

    "selftext": "- compilation of 16 launch reviews with ~6420 gaming benchmarks at 1080p, 1440p, 2160p\n- only benchmarks at real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks\n- geometric mean in all cases\n- standard raster performance without ray-tracing and/or DLSS/FSR/XeSS\n- extra ray-tracing benchmarks (mostly without upscaler) after the standard raster benchmarks\n- stock performance on (usually) reference/FE boards, no overclocking\n- factory overclocked cards were normalized to reference clocks/performance, but just for the overall performance average (so the listings show the original performance result, just the performance index has been normalized)\n- missing results were extrapolated (for a more accurate average) based on the available & former results\n- performance average is (some) weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks\n- all reviews should have used newer drivers for _all_ cards\n- power draw numbers based on a couple of reviews, always for the graphics card only\n- performance/price ratio (higher is better) for 1440p raster performance and 1440p ray-tracing performance\n- for the full results and some more explanations check [3DCenter's launch analysis](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti)\n\nNote: There are hardly any performance results available for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB. Therefore, their performance was extrapolated for the overview table based solely on the difference between 4060Ti-8GB and 4060Ti-16GB, taking into account a small offset due to the different TDP (which does not exist for the 5060Ti).\n\nNote: Sometimes the following tables are become to big (wide) for mobile browsers on Reddit (last column is the GeForce RTX 5070). In this case, please try the [mobile version of 3DCenter](https://m.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-seite-2).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRaster

RA = Raster, RT = Ray-Tracing, E.Eff. = Energy Efficiency, P/P = Performance/Price Ratio    \nNote: retail prices assuming real availability - for old SKUs, these are typically from the years 2023/2024; for the Radeon RX 9070 it's simple an assumption\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**On the performance of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti _16GB_:** The card beats the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti with +14-17% more performance, in line with the gains of most other RTX50 cards. Another advantage of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is that the 16 GB version is now the primary version (in contrast to the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti) and also comes at no major additional cost. On the AMD side, the Radeon RX 7700 XT is only a suitable counterpart at raster rendering, but is clearly beaten at ray tracing - and of course also has the smaller amount of VRAM. At best, the Radeon RX 7800 XT is a passable opponent to the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, but also costs a little more (in Europe). Unfortunately, the US prices are difficult to assess at the moment, as the US market is completely overbought.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Important note on the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti _8GB_:** The above performance evaluation based on average frame rates does not show the complete picture for this GPU. But even with average frame rates, it can be seen that the card lags behind in raster rendering from 2160p, but in ray tracing from 1080p. However, differences at average frame rates are always only the very last sign of too less VRAM. Long before that, there are already (sometimes considerable) disadvantages at the minimum frame rates as well as a declining image quality due to missing textures, delayed loading textures or even a generally lower texture quality. This was explained quite well in a video by [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdZoa6Gzl6s), and is a known problem with too less VRAM. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB is therefore already borderline even under 1080p and can therefore not be recommended with a clear conscience for a GPU purchase in 2025.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nList of hardware reviews evaluated for this analysis:\n\n- [ComputerBase](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-test.92119/)\n- [Cowcotland](https://www.cowcotland.com/articles/4571/test-gainward-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-python-blackwell-enfin-pour-le-plus-grand-nombre.html)\n- [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n- [Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cskegn1-D7s)\n- [Hardware & Co](https://hardwareand.co/dossiers/gpu/test-de-la-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-enfin-une-carte-blackwell-capable-de-faire-oublier-sa-devanciere)\n- [Hardwareluxx](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65938-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-mit-16-gb-im-test.html)\n- [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-im-test-sparsam-im-verbrauch-aber-nicht-ganz-unproblematisch-fuer-gamer/)\n- [KitGuru](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review-ft-gigabyte-palit/)\n- [PC Games Hardware](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5060-Ti-16GB-Grafikkarte-281131/Tests/Release-Review-Preis-kaufen-Benchmark-Specs-1470373/)\n- [PurePC](https://www.purepc.pl/test-msi-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-gaming-recenzja-opinia-wydajnosc-cena-premiera-blackwell)\n- [Quasarzone](https://quasarzone.com/bbs/qc_bench/views/94640)\n- [SweClockers](https://www.sweclockers.com/test/41012-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-mellankort-mellanpris-mellanbra)\n- [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/palit-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-infinity-3-16-gb/)\n- [TechSpot](https://www.techspot.com/review/2979-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb/) / [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6qZwJsp5X4)\n- [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n- [Tweakers](https://tweakers.net/reviews/13162/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-haalt-de-lat-maar-die-lag-niet-hoog.html)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource: [3DCenter.org](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti)\n\nPS: 3DCenter is free of advertising and is financed solely by donations.",

      "Nvidia is really trying to make each new product a hard buy",
      "Only a 30% performance gain over the 3060 Ti after 4.5 years.\n\nI‚Äôve become bearish on meaningful value gains in newer generations of hardware going forward. Not even a drastic node shrink (from Samsung 8N to TSMC N4), was enough to provide a meaningful cost-per-frame improvement from the 3060 Ti to the 4060 Ti. When the next node shrink occurs with the 6060 Ti, I expect Nvidia to pass very little cost savings to the consumer.\n\nPeople who expect good value gains will be waiting a looong time for a card that provides just that. It ironically makes the 16GB 5060 Ti a solid card to buy; it‚Äôs a card specifically designed for people who wait.",
      "I honestly think the x60 cards would be quite solid across the board if they weren't vram limited\n\nI rarely hit the limits of what my hardware can actually do, because I'm always running of vram and losing 70% of my framerate",
      "the 5060 ti 16gb is the only card worth it, and only for people who are still running 6gb/8gb versions of the older x060 ti cards\n\nit's not even something that shows up in benchmarks.\n\nthose 8gb cards absolutely shit the bed the millisecond vram starts paging, and they have effective \\~6.5GB because of what windows' compositor is always stealing.\n\nif you turn off dlss and frame gen you might get lucky and run with low enough vram usage to be stable.\n\nbut if you run with dlss and fg on, you're fucked. like with oblivion I used engine.ini edits to force the engine to limit its streaming pool and effects so that they only consume 70% of my vram, but the game isn't the problem.. frame gen is. turning frame gen on increases my 50fps to \\~80-100, sounds good, til you notice it also increases vram usage by 15% the second you toggle it on. then you start paging out of vram and it's stutterville at 20fps, frame gen just straight up disables, and if you disable dlss your native fps has gone from 50 to 14.\n\nbeen dealing with this since the 2060 series because I constantly end up with the low vram x060 ti card. this time around I threw in the extra $100 to get the 16gb version.\n\nI don't even care if the perf gains are minimal. you can give me 15% higher fps, but that extra vram meaning I no longer deal with incessant framerate drops in every single AAA+ makes it worth every penny",
      "Please never stop doing these meta reviews dude its awesome!",
      "drop texture res? Im running Oblivion with medium textures and I don't have any of the issues you're describing with FG on."

      "He likely wasn't referencing the absolute speed but the fact that a 128-bit bus is usually reserved for the absolute bottom of the barrel Nvidia cards.  These cards are going for $550+, that's a crazy price for such a small bus.  The die is tiny too.",

      "\"Solid card\" is an interesting way to phrase \"massively over-priced entry level mobile sized GPU that's basically a 5030\".  Yes, Nvidia will give you 16GB at $550 because the die is so tiny it couldn't possiblely cut into their AI market.\n\nOne could have had the same level of performance in 2024 for $350 plus two free games with that.  Since when is a regression in price to performance \"Solid\"?

Generally, I think the RTX 9070 and the XT model are too expensive for my budget, and I don't know if the RX 9060 (XT?)will be worth looking into?\"\nMy monitor has the G-Sync module in it, and 144hz refresh rate, so thats also something to take into consideration.\nIt does not support freesync.",

      "If you don't mind the AMD compromises the 7800XT is 18% faster. Problem is it's RDNA3 so it's stuck with awful FSR3, has bad RT performance for it's class, has absolutely awful Path Tracing performance worst than a 3060. 9070 has FSR4 which is pretty good and has much better RT performance but Path Tracing is still oddly awful on it.\n\n\nNow if you go with either you miss out on the army of Nvidia features like actually good productivity app support, good VR support, DLSS, Ray Reconstruction, reflex (AMD has antilag 2 but game support is almost non existent), multiframe gen, DLSS transformer model, path tracing, and the rest of the Nvidia suite.\n\n\nFor me I'd go with a 5060ti 16GB and OC it to get it above 4070 performance. Productivity apps, VR and DLSS are a must for me and 4070 level performance is pretty respectable at path tracing using DLSS (see Digital Foundry s countless videos on it). Sadly it feels like if you want the most \"PC gaming\" gaming experience not having Nvidia is like not using Steam as your game store, it's just a lot of compromises.",

      "Uhh.... I'll be on the 1080ti until it breaths it's last dying breath. \n\nNot paying these prices for a graphics card unless I absolutely have to.\n\nAnd at that point it's going to be an entire system overhaul.",
      "Honestly, good. I hope they all sit on the shelves until prices stabilize again. We went through this in 2020 and again now. It‚Äôs not the product that‚Äôs bad. It‚Äôs the inflated prices."

I will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links. This will be sorted alphabetically.\n\n# Written Articles\n\n# [Babeltechreviews](https://babeltechreviews.com/rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review/)\n\n>The¬†**Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti**¬†is a competent midrange GPU that brings incremental improvements over its predecessor, especially when leveraging¬†**DLSS 4**. It performs well at¬†**1080p and 1440p**, and offers solid gains if coming from a¬†**30-series or older**¬†card. Content creators also benefit from enhanced NVENC support for faster 4:2:2 video encoding. Its compact design, low power draw, and frame generation capabilities make it a practical choice for mainstream gamers and small form factor builds.\n\n>However, for a¬†**new generation card**, the performance gains are modest‚Äîtypically around¬†**10‚Äì15% over the RTX 4060 Ti**‚Äîmaking it a hard sell unless priced at or below MSRP. If prices drift north of $449,¬†**AMD‚Äôs RX 7700 XT or 7800 XT**¬†become better buys with more VRAM and stronger raster performance. Ultimately, the RTX 5060 Ti is a¬†**fine choice at the right price**¬†but fails to impress as a major step forward. Wait for discounts or consider stepping up to an RTX 4070 Super or AMD 7800 XT if your budget allows.\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n\n# Digital Foundry Video\n\n>With our testing complete, the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is a tricky card to judge, given that its performance differentials can swing substantially based on the game and even game scene tested.¬†\n\n>Based on¬†*our*¬†game selections though, the card is in the same territory as the RX 7800 XT, with an average 22 percent lead over the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB at 1440p. That's one of the biggest gen-on-gen gains that we've seen going from Ada Lovelace to Blackwell, but it's worth considering that the RTX 4060 Ti didn't really shift the needle when it came to beating its predecessor.¬†\n\n>For those upgrading from prior cards in the same class, there's around a 37 percent increase over the RTX 3060 Ti from 2020. Meanwhile, versus the 2019 vintage RTX 2060 Super, you're getting double the performance. In both cases, the DLSS 4 feature set is appealing and I'd consider the RTX 5060 Ti a fine upgrade there.¬†\n\n>Elsewhere, the RTX 5070 is significantly faster than the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB - to the tune of a mighty 38 percent. My results also see the RTX 4070 beat the RTX 5060 Ti by 11 percent, though overclocking can make up most of the difference in many games.¬†\n\n>Based on the RTX 5060 Ti's overall performance, the card is solid enough but hardly spectacular - meaning that price comes into focus. Looking at dollars per frame based on MSRP, it's disappointing that the RTX 5070 offers better value - and I can't help but think there ought to have been a single 16GB or even 12GB model at $399. (Despite the 128-bit bus, 3GB memory modules do exist that would have unlocked 12GB as a potential option - though it's unclear whether they're available in the quantities and prices needed for a budget GPU.)¬†\n\n>So as we keep saying, the RTX 5060 Ti is a bit tricky. The 8GB card on mixed benchmarks will provide better value than the 16GB version overall and compares more favourably to the RTX 5070. On the flipside, we just can't recommend the 8GB card given how often we're running into VRAM issues with many games, especially upon launch.¬†\n\n>The 16GB version is the one to have then, but with the 5070 offering 35 to 43 percent better performance at \"only\" 28 percent more money, you're again funnelled towards the higher-priced offering - though $120 extra is a significant step up in this sector of the market. I just wish that Nvidia understood that value is supposed to increase the further down the stack you go - not decrease.¬†\n\n>The PCIe situation is also not great, with the 5060 Ti's 8x lanes translating into some noticeable performance degradation on older PCIe 3.0 motherboards due to bandwidth limitations. While the majority of users will be using these cards with modern motherboards with PCIe 4.0 or 5.0 slots, these more budget-oriented cards are more likely to be used with similarly low-end or just antiquated motherboards compared to higher-end GPUs. Our testing shows up to a 20 percent performance drop in¬†[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle](https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review)¬†at 1080p, with less sizeable double-digit percentage drops in¬†[F1 24](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-24)¬†and single-digit percentage drops in¬†[Black Myth: Wukong](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong).¬†\n\n>Ultimately, there are question marks over value, but the RTX 5060 Ti is worth taking a look at.¬†\n\n# [eTeknix Article](https://www.eteknix.com/asus-prime-oc-rtx-5060-ti-graphics-card-review/)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR5phLkePYA)\n\n>So, a bit of a tangent, but back on track. The 3060 Ti was a good card when it came out, but is definitely showing its age, and with the 5060 Ti sitting 29% ahead overall, there‚Äôs definitely a viable option to buy it, especially as 3060 Ti‚Äôs are still holding their price for some weird reason. The 4060 Ti however, sees the 5060 Ti around 19% faster and while, and I‚Äôm sure NVIDIA will be happy for me to say this, it has multi-frame generation upscaling which works some kind of voodoo magic, but people still aren‚Äôt sold on it, but the tide is turning somewhat.\n\n>If NVIDIA came in with a GPU that offered a 30% generation uplift or higher in rasterisation, and higher in raytracing gen on gen, plus MFG, then yes, I think it would be much better received, but that‚Äôs not the case, and instead, if you‚Äôre already on a 40 series card, I can‚Äôt say there‚Äôs an argument to upgrade to any 50 series, with maybe the exception being the RTX 5090, but that‚Äôs in a whole different league. Beyond that, people are looking for a reason to upgrade and I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm getting a bit bored of saying things like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good but‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou should buy it if you can get it for $X‚Äù. The argument is wearing a bit thin.\n\n>I will say that the 5060 Ti on paper, if you take pricing out of the equation, does come across as a good performer. It even sits ahead of the 3070 Ti, and that‚Äôs what we want to see. The other issue is AMD. At that price point, AMD are the better buy, but again, and I swear this will be the second to last time I say it, but AMD cards are inflated too, so I‚Äôll leave you with one piece of advice, and it‚Äôs a big one.\n\n>Regardless, the 5060 Ti is good, but it feels like it‚Äôs much the same as we‚Äôve seen with the rest of the stack. If the price is right, and you‚Äôre not already on a 40 series card, then there‚Äôs an argument, but if the price isn‚Äôt right and/or you‚Äôre already on a 40 series card, then maybe give this one a miss, unless MFG really tickles your fancy.\n\n>For now, that‚Äôs going to wrap up another 50 series GPU review. With a not-so-easy-to-understand conclusion, I‚Äôd like to think we‚Äôve at least shown you the facts, and that you can make an educated decision as to what to do from there based on that all-important word. Price.\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review/)\n\n>The RTX 5060 Ti is built around a rasterizer shading engine and includes 4608 CUDA cores. It stems from the RTX 50 series, which introduces a new generation of Ray Tracing and Tensor cores positioned close to the shader engine. These RT cores never pause as they produce vivid lighting, shadow, and reflection effects. Although Tensor cores sometimes seem tricky to measure in terms of raw benefits, their influence becomes obvious when paired with DLSS3 and the updated DLSS4.¬†The 50 series represents more than a mere upgrade; it stands as a leap forward that meets different gaming requirements. Whether someone is immersed in 2K (2560x1440) gaming or venturing into the realm of 4K (3840x2160), the RTX 5060 Ti adapts when you enable DLSS4/MFG. In baseline performance (depending on where and what you measure), expect reference cards to be \\~15% faster than the 4060 Ti, and OC models closing in at perhaps 20% for the fastest locked and configured models.\n\n>The RTX 5060 Ti steps onto the stage, immediately ingraining gamers with very decent frame rates. Sure, it might lag slightly behind some close competitors when it comes to standardized shading, but overall, the graphics performance is solid enough.¬†What's interesting is that the improvement isn't uniform across all games. One title might skyrocket with huge frame rate gains, while another enjoys just a modest boost. But the real star of the show is NVIDIA‚Äôs heavy investment in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and neural shading technologies. Activate DLSS4 with frame generation set at 4x (if possible), and the difference is obvious right away‚Äîit feels like catching a glimpse of gaming‚Äôs future.¬†Yet, there's a lingering question among gamers: Is the community ready to fully embrace these AI-powered enhancements? Technology evolves so quickly these days, and some players are hesitant to fully rely on machine learning to boost their gaming visuals and performance. However, early adopters aren't holding back; they're diving right in. As more players see what DLSS4 can achieve, particularly in new, visually demanding games, the excitement is sure to spread.¬†There's no doubt about it‚ÄîDLSS4 is impressive, and early performance data backs this up. Gamers using ultra-wide or 1440p monitors will especially appreciate how every pixel gets pushed to its limits. And those chasing ultimate 4K experiences will also find plenty to love. By combining the raw power of the RTX 5060 Ti with DLSS4's dynamic upscaling, games can now achieve frame rates that were once considered impossible.¬†While some might label the RTX 5060 Ti as just a mainstream GPU, it‚Äôs actually much more versatile. It comfortably handles high-end AAA games without breaking a sweat, making it perfect for gamers who don't always need every setting maxed but still want smooth, impressive performance. Additionally, content creators and professionals using GPU-heavy tasks like video editing or 3D rendering will find the 5060 series quite capable. Its powerful CUDA cores speed up rendering, giving creators valuable extra time.¬†Of course, true enthusiasts might already have their eyes set on the higher-end 5070 Ti or 5080 models, but the RTX 5060 Ti hits a better price point for most PC gamers\n\n>Priced around the $429 mark, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti seems promising enough. Whether it becomes your next favorite GPU depends on how expensive it'll sell once it hits the shelves. But overall it's a product series that we can recommend if you're coming from the RTX 3000 or equivalent graphics card era.\n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/msi-and-pny-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-review)\n\n>Like some of the other members of the¬†[GeForce RTX 50 series](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-architecture-overview), the new GeForce RTX 5060 Ti¬†offers a modest upgrade in rasterization performance over its previous-gen counterpart If we don't factor in newer technologies and DLSS 4 with multi frame generation, the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is about \\~20% faster than the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. For the millions of gamers still using lower-end or older \"xx60\" class cards, however,¬†GeForce RTX 5060 Ti would be significant upgrade. Not only is the¬†GeForce RTX 5060 Ti much faster than older cards for gaming, but it's got better display output support, a more capable media engine, and its power requirements are modest enough that most folks won't need a PSU upgrade either -- just stick with the 16GB version if you've got the budget. 8GB cards are going to be much more limited moving forward.\n\n>With an MSRP of $429, the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti's introductory price comes in a bit higher than 8GB GeForce RTX 4060 Ti cards, but below 16GB variants that were introduced later. Assuming gamers will be able to get their hands on¬†GeForce RTX 5060 Tis for prices approaching MSRP, it represents a good value and a significant upgrade for gamers and creators still rocking RTX 30 series, or older, cards in the same class. As we've mentioned with the other GeForce RTX 50 series cards, the¬†GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is¬†faster, more capable, and more power-efficient than its previous generation counterpart and anyone that likes tinker will have plenty of fun overclocking. Without leveraging DLSS 4‚Äôs multi frame generation, its generational performance uplift is smaller than what we‚Äôve seen from NVIDIA in the past, though.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-in-test-economical-consumption-surprisingly-fast-but-not-with-8gb/)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB tested today marks the current entry of NVIDIA‚Äôs Blackwell architecture into the mid-range segment and takes on the established competition with the new GB206-300 chip. While the 8 GB version can hardly be meaningfully tested in modern scenarios due to the limited memory configuration, the 16 GB version is the focus of all meaningful analyses. The GPU is based on four 32-bit memory channels and uses the clamshell method to expand capacity, allowing a total of eight 2 GB GDDR7 modules to be used. Despite identical bandwidth to the 8 GB version of 448 GB/s at 28 Gbps memory clock, this results in improved suitability for memory-intensive applications, but without an increase in memory bandwidth.\n\n>The gaming performance of the RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB is convincing in current titles, especially when DLSS 4 and Frame Generation are activated. In a direct comparison with the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB, the new card is 23 percent ahead on average with AI functions enabled, and still around 17 to 18 percent ahead without factory overclocking. The strong increase in minimum frame rates (P1 Low) is remarkable, where up to 36 percent lead was measured. This leads to a significantly more stable gaming experience, especially at WQHD resolution. Efficiency has been noticeably improved, as performance is clearly higher with comparable power consumption. Under full gaming load, the average power consumption is between 155 and 165 watts, while the power limit of 180 watts is generally not exhausted. Even under extreme conditions, the card remains thermally and electrically stable.\n\n>My test with the MSI GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Gaming Trio showed that high-quality board partner designs can exploit the full potential of the GPU. The card comes with factory overclocking, which results in around 2 to 3 percent more performance than a reference card. The cooling design with four heatpipes, a solid copper block and a fin array with a high air flow rate ensures low GPU temperatures of around 63 ¬∞C in gaming mode. The memory modules remain below 68 ¬∞C, also thanks to the generous cooling through the backplate and via separate pads. Acoustically, the card remains very quiet at around 31 dB(A) under load, with only a minimal audible whirring of the coils. The power supply via a total of eight phases delivered stable voltage values, even with manual overclocking.\n\n>All in all, the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB can be characterized as a modern mid-range GPU, which is primarily aimed at users who do not want to do without the latest technologies such as DLSS 4, Reflex 2 and ray tracing, but do not want to spend 500 euros or more on a graphics card. With an RRP of 429 US dollars, the card is significantly lower than the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB at market launch and also offers more memory, better efficiency and a modern architecture. It is a particularly attractive option for upgrades from the RTX 3000 or RX 6000 generation. The 8 GB version, on the other hand, should be viewed critically, as it quickly reaches its limits, especially in WQHD and memory-intensive scenarios, and cannot provide a complete picture of the performance of this GPU generation, even if you can perhaps save a one-off 50 USD. In other words, a card with two faces, where the only slightly cheaper offer is clearly the worse one. In view of the different markets, NVIDIA won‚Äôt care about this, only the customer should really be sensitized.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review-ft-gigabyte-palit/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLjLrDYcY70)\n\n>**Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti**¬†is the latest in a long line of Blackwell GPUs to hit the market, arriving in both 8GB and 16GB flavours. I was only sent 16GB models for this review and it didn't sound like 8GB variants would be particularly prevalent at retail upon launch ‚Äì probably for the better considering a 8GB GPU launching at $379 sounds like madness to me.\n\n>But back to the 5060 Ti 16GB, it's a curious GPU that epitomises the term ‚Äòmixed-bag'. On the one hand, rasterisation performance is solid for 1080p and even 1440p gaming, though the latter resolution becomes more of a challenge if you stick to Ultra settings.\n\n>However, compared to the RTX 3060 Ti, we're only looking at a 31% uplift for 1080p rasterised gaming ‚Äì and that's a GPU which launched at the¬†[end of 2020,](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review/)¬†almost five years ago! It's clearly underwhelming and exemplifies the struggle for meaningful performance increases that this market segment has been crying out for.\n\n>That said, in the context of¬†*today's*¬†market, I don't think the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is a bad product. After all, it's still delivering circa 15% gains over its predecessor, the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, which actually sounds decent compared to some other Blackwell GPUs like the¬†[RTX 5070](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5070-review/), which is just 1-5% ahead of the RTX 4070 Super. As much as we may want larger generational gains, that's just not the reality for the 50 series given it remains on TSMC's 4N node, so I do think we need to be realistic with expectations.\n\n>It also helps that the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is launching with at the lower price point of ¬£399/$429. The 4060 Ti 16GB initially hit the market at ¬£479, though it did later drop below ¬£450, but even against that figure we're looking at an 11% price drop. There is of course a fair bit up in the air around PC hardware prices right now, but I do at least have¬†*some*¬†confidence that this price point will be achievable after seeing the RTX 5070 in stock at MSRP over the last couple of weeks. Heck, it's even been on sale for¬†[*less*¬†than MSRP](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/matthew-wilson/rtx-5070-drops-below-msrp-in-uk/), so we'd hope for more of the same this time around.\n\n>Of course, the RTX 3060 Ti comparison gets much more favourable when looking at ray tracing performance, largely thanks to having double the VRAM. 8GB cards these days just cannot deliver certain experiences when ray tracing is enabled, resulting in the 5060 Ti 16GB being multiple times faster in titles like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.\n\n>You could make the case that the RTX 5070 is the biggest threat to the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB ‚Äì it's readily in stock at MSRP, offers performance that's some 35-40% better depending on the game, and it's not¬†*too*¬†much more expensive, sitting at ¬£529. That said, it's priced high enough to still be out of reach for many, in which case the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB becomes the obvious choice around the ¬£400 mark ‚Äì for now, at least.\n\n>So no, it hasn't blown me away, and you can easily argue that the product itself is fairly underwhelming. But in this market segment, Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is our new go-to recommendation ‚Äì just don't get the 8GB model, please.\n\n>A final word on the two cards tested today.¬†**Palit's Infinity 3**¬†is a capable model, it's clearly built to hit the MSRP and as such is fairly light on features, but it runs quiet and cool, so I can't really complain.¬†**Gigabyte's**¬†**Aorus Elite**¬†is a much more premium offering, sporting RGB lighting, dual-BIOS and a metal backplate, while the cooler is more sophisticated, resulting in even lower thermals and noise levels than the Infinity 3. I don't have a confirmed price for it yet, but it's almost certainly going to come in¬†*well*¬†above MSRP, so as good as it is, be careful not to overpay as the 5070 could make more sense if the pricing creeps closer to ¬£500.\n\n# LanOC\n\n>TBD\n\n# PC World Article\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1xYjf3h_Q)\n\n>TBD\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-tuf-16-gb/)\n\n>For this launch we've updated our test setup again and retested all comparison cards with the newest drivers. We also updated the BIOS on our 9800X3D and added several new games, like our first RT exclusive title Indiana Jones, and Path Tracing is now an additional section in all reviews. At 1440p, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 13% performance uplift over the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB, which is quite small. At 4K, the increase is bigger, reaching 20%. A gen-over-gen improvement of 13% is not much, but at least it's more than RTX 5080 which only got 8% at 1440p. The RTX 5090, 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 did better, giving you an extra 20% at 1440p. Compared to the RTX 3060 Ti from two generations ago, the performance uplift is only 31%, usually we expect a doubling in performance over two generations. With these numbers the RTX 5060 Ti ends up a bit faster than AMD's aging Radeon RX 7700 XT, 11% behind the RX 7800 XT, which is much more expensive of course. NVIDIA's RTX 5070 non-Ti is a whopping 39% faster. The RTX 5060 Ti does not catch last generation's RTX 4070 either, which remains 16% ahead. If you've seen our manual overclocking results, there is a ton of headroom, like +15%, so I have no idea why NVIDIA clocked their card so low, especially considering the fact that it's underperforming by so much.\n\n>The RTX 5060 Ti is a fantastic choice for gaming at 1080p Full HD, especially with a high-refresh-rate monitor. It also has enough muscle for 1440p gaming in most games at maximum details. Some of the most demanding titles, or when RT is enabled will require you to use DLSS though to get a good gaming experience.\n\n>Thanks to its factory overclock, the ASUS TUF OC gains an extra 4% in real-life performance over the base RTX 5060 Ti, which is small, but every bit helps of course. Competing cards achieve similar performance levels, with all cards hitting +3% or +4.\n\n>Power consumption of the RTX 5060 Ti is good. While some other Blackwell cards had quite high power consumption in idle, multi-monitor and media playback, this isn't a problem at all here. The extra memory chips do increase the power draw slightly, but it's not enough to worry about. In gaming, I noticed that all models reach around 160 W without ray tracing, which is well below the default power limit of 180 W. However, when ray tracing is enabled, power usage increases and occasionally reaches the power limit‚Äîstill, the RTX 5060 Ti is definitely not power starved.\n\n# The FPS Review\n\n>TBD\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n\n>Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti 16GB delivers a solid combination of performance for the suggested $429 base MSRP. However, as we've seen with every other GPU launch of the past five months, retail prices can be much higher. It's impossible to separate performance from pricing when looking at the overall value of a GPU, and the only thing concrete that we can point to are the MSRPs. Except those can run the gamut from being at least moderately accurate to being completely nonsense.\n\n>When the 4060 Ti 16GB came out a month after the 8GB variant, it felt severely underwhelming. Neither version was really designed to handle 4K gaming, but that was the only place where we measured a significant difference in performance. Two years later, things haven't changed¬†*too*¬†much, but the reduced $50 price gap (on paper at least) between the 5060 Ti 8GB and 16GB makes the 16GB a far easier recommendation. In fact, we'll go so far as to question why Nvidia even felt the need to create an 8GB version.\n\n>Yes, 8GB will be cheaper, and it will also be more limited due to the lack of VRAM. There are games (Indiana Jones and the Great Circle) where you can't even try to run ultra settings on an 8GB card. That's an Nvidia promoted game that simply crashes to desktop with a video memory error when you try higher settings on the 4060 and 4060 Ti 8GB GPUs, along with a bunch of other previous generation RTX cards.\n\n>The good news with the 16GB card is that memory bandwidth has improved thanks to GDDR7, so that it's not likely to hit VRAM capacity or bandwidth limitations. 56% more bandwidth than the 4060 Ti is a sizeable improvement. The fact that most games only show about 15% higher performance indicates that GPU compute is the limiting factor more than bandwidth, however.\n\n>But as we've already said numerous times, the price difference could very easily end up being more than $50. And factors like on again/off again tariffs, limited supply, product demand, and more could push the 16GB card to the point where maybe it won't be the better choice. The RTX 5070 still serves as a ceiling on how much more the 5060 Ti 16GB can realistically cost before it's \"too much,\" but with 5070 cards often listed for $700 or more, there's a lot of wiggle room right now.\n\n>Price and availability will be the key determiners of how good the 5060 Ti 16GB looks, and that will also vary by market. Europe and Asia might end up with a much different GPU landscape than the U.S. as far as graphics card values go.\n\n>What we can say is that the 5060 Ti 16GB isn't a massive generational improvement, but it¬†*is*¬†an improvement. It's also¬†*supposed*¬†to be less expensive than its 4060 Ti 16GB predecessor. Those are both good things, and stuff like neural rendering, DLSS 4, and Multi Frame Generation are merely extras that you can use as you see fit. Now we just wait to see what today's launch looks like, how quickly the 5060 Ti models sell out, and how high prices go.\n\n>Our score of 4-stars represents a \"best guess\" on what the 5060 Ti 16GB will look like in the current GPU market. Obviously, prices for all graphics cards, new and used, are all over the map. If the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB costs 50% more than the MSRP, and other cards¬†*don't*¬†show a similar markup, that makes it a worse value and a less desirable card and it would deserve a lower score. We can't predict where things will go, so pay more attention to the performance and real-world pricing than the single score that we've assigned, because uncontrollable factors play into the overall package.\n\n# [Computerbase - German](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-test.92119/)\n\n# [HardwareLuxx - German](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65938-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-mit-16-gb-im-test.html)\n\n# [PCGH - German](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5060-Ti-16GB-Grafikkarte-281131/Tests/Release-Review-Preis-kaufen-Benchmark-Specs-1470373/)\n\n# [Elchapuzasinformatico - Spanish](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2025/04/msi-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-gaming-trio-oc-review/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n# Video Review\n\n# [Der8auer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ5HOxQFKkg&pp=ygUIZGVyYmF1ZXI%3D)\n\n# Digital Foundry Video\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR5phLkePYA)\n\n# [Gamers Nexus Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cskegn1-D7s)\n\n# [Hardware Canucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltc1Lzjfp-c)\n\n# [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6qZwJsp5X4)\n\n# [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBVLnN5UGvk)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLjLrDYcY70)\n\n# [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMOqQS7ItXE)\n\n# Linus Tech Tips\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R2eGg4wRvk)\n\n# Optimum Tech\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1xYjf3h_Q)\n\n# [Techtesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGBkWeGyUc4)\n\n# Tech Yes City",

      "Correct, the GPU chip physically has only 8 lanes of connectivity",
      "tldr:\n\n>**x8 4.0**  \nWe are thrilled to report that running the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti with PCI-Express 4.0 x8 has an insignificant impact on performance. Averaged across all game tests, we see a 2% drop in performance at 1080p, and an even smaller 1% drop in performance at 1440p. While not exactly relevant to this GPU, even 4K Ultra HD posts only a 1% drop in performance with PCIe Gen 4 x8. This should be fantastic news for everyone who has the latest processors (Intel 12th Gen or later, AMD Ryzen 5000 or later), but with a motherboard that only supports Gen 4 on the main x16 PEG slot. There aren't really any outliers to report where the lack of Gen 5 puts the RTX 5060 Ti at a disadvantage. So, for those of you on mid-range chipsets such as the AMD B650 or Intel B660, rejoice.\n\n>**x8 3.0**  \nThe next data point is Gen 3 x8. This would be applicable for those using an older processor or APU that only puts out Gen 3 PCIe, but one that's fairly recent. A good example of this would be the Ryzen 5000G Cezanne, which can be used on Gen 4-capable AMD 500-series chipset motherboards, but only has a Gen 3-capable PCIe root. Other examples would be Intel 10th Gen Core Comet Lake on Intel 500-series chipset motherboards. Here, the RTX 5060 Ti posts a 4% loss in performance averaged across all game tests. This is an acceptable level of performance loss, all things considered, and should give confidence to those on these older platforms.\n\n>**Ray Tracing, DLSS, and Frame Generation**  \nThe above trends also hold with ray tracing. Gen 4 x8 loses 2% performance averaged across all tests at 1080p, and about 5% with Gen 3 x8. Although small, the 5% performance loss could pinch a little, considering that ray tracing imposes its own performance cost on the overall performance of the game.\n\n>**Closing Thoughts**  \nA mid-range performance-segment GPU like the RTX 5060 Ti should be affected much less from changes in host interface bandwidth than a high-end GPU like the RTX 5090, and that much is evident from our testing. The RTX 5060 Ti isn't all that faster than the RTX 4060 Ti to begin with, and so it was natural for Gen 4 x8 and Gen 3 x8 to post only marginal drops in performance, which become a bit more pronounced in ray tracing tests, where the overall cost of ray tracing weighs in. That said, it's worth noting that while we got the RTX 5060 Ti to run on Gen 4 and Gen 3 PCIe, the processor is still the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D‚Äîthe fastest CPU for gaming as of this writing, and so any performance deltas you see on your Gen 4 or Gen 3 platform could be a result of having a processor slower than the 9800X3D.",
      "So one of the pins near my pcie4 x16 slots in broken near the end of my motherboard, so basically, does the gpu have a x16 layout but only use x8? And please tell me if the connectors near the end are used or not, or is it just the x8",
      "arent they PCI 5.0? 5@x8 has the same bandwidth than 4@x16. Dunno about latency thou\n\nBut yeh I know that this card probably wont be installed on PCI5 capable systems",
      "Any reason they are not comparing x8 vs. x16?"

I remember I got my first black screen when I upgraded to 576.40 so I stayed at this driver. \n\nI did manage to send a kernel dump file before all of this though and someone from the driver team acknowldeged it and said this: \n\n>Thank you.¬† This black screen crash is related to shader cache crash and is a different issue I believe which should be fixed in our next driver scheduled for next month.¬† I‚Äôll share this dmp file with the team but if you update your drivers and the issue returns with desktop apps, please send us that dmp file as that is not related to the shader cache bug.\n\nThis particular black screen crash when loading up a game is because of shader cache building issue on any game, be it in main menu or in-game asynchronously. \n\nNow black screens or signal loss(OS is still responsive in the background and audio plays if i connect the audio jack to motherboard) during normal desktop use could be something you're talking about related to WDDM, but again it happens on 576.40 and above. 576.28 is fine. I am on latest 24H2 26100.4188 build, release preview channel.\n\n>Tracking a strange issue with Windows 11 24H2 (WDDM) that may be related to¬†*application triggered*¬†black screens.\n\nCan you tell more about this?",
      "To clarify, application triggered black screens related to VRR under Windows 11 24H2.",
      "Very interesting. I'll keep this in mind if I upgrade to .40 or .52. TBH, I just wanna play some games peacefully after a full day's work and this issue annoyed me for a week so I'm hesitant to upgrade and test as everything is fine for now in 576.28. Please update on this if there are any developments. Thank you."

Its holding up fine but recent games seems to struggle to much.\n\nAnd i have kind fixed budget. And I need to buy something.\n\nBest i can afford is RTX 5060 TI 16GB  or RX 7800xt (previously i have considered Intel B580 so its already a huge price increase.) So RX 9070 or RTX 4070 or 5070 is not an option)\n\nIt has to be one of those two.\n\nIn theory 7800xt destroys 5060 TI. In every gameplay i saw like 10 to 30 fps more with RX 7800xt\n\nSo its seems that choice is simple. But, (there is always but) its not that simple.\n\nA small background.\n\nI play at 1080p 60hz LCD screen or 4K 60hz TV screen (only older games - 1080ti is too weak for 4K)\n\nI have rather weak CPU i7 11600H with DDR4 3200 memory.\n\nI would not change that in near future.\n\nAnd here comes upscaling and frame generation\n\nNvidia DLSS an FG is far more superior and common than FSR3.1.\n\nAnd i think for 4K gaming even RX 7800xt will struggle to to get 60FPS without upscaling.\n\nFor newer games (GTA 6 ???) even at 1080p i guess\n\nSo card with bad upscaling is not good choice for next few years....\n\nSo although im impressed with raw performance of RX 7800xt I still consider waiting for price of 5060 TI 16GB decrease, so it will be cheaper than RX 7800xt\n\nBut choice has to be made.\n\nWhich one would you buy?",

The 7800 xt is stuck with FSR 3.1 (which is abysmal), is less efficient, and performs worse with RT on (unless it's a super light, and therefore pointless rt implementation). The 5060 ti should overclock quite easily to just about match a 4070 in raw performance (not that far off of the 7800xt).\n\nEdit: It may also be worth sticking with your 1080 ti for just a bit longer and saving enough to get a 9070, 9070 xt, or 5070 ti",
      "I own a 7700 XT and I never experienced that.",
      "Tbh the 5060ti 16gb makes more sense to me, yes the 7800xt is a bit faster, but i think the current version of DLSS grants a bigger advantage. FSR 3 is pretty meh and falls really short compared to DLSS 4, only the 9000 series with FSR 4 comes close but obviously you'll be spending more for a 9070/xt.",

I will let you know how it works:)\nWas it good choice? Time will tell...",
      "I dont agree, dlss quality is like 30% performance increase, and basically all games where you will struggle with fps will have it.",
      "In truth, you‚Äôre asking if you should buy the midrange card (7800XT) or the budget option from the newest series (5060TI) which is purely up to you. Me though, I wouldn‚Äôt spend an equivalent amount on the budget option when you have a midrange card capable of some great raster performance available to you. Your cpu isn‚Äôt all that weak, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with ddr4 memory, your cpu gets some pretty decent price to performance and in truth I don‚Äôt understand why you think you‚Äôll need any kind of frame gen. If you want frames and raw performance, the 7800XT is your choice, if you *want* to use frame gen and have slightly less frames without using that feature then you should get the 5060TI. My choice would be the 7800XT though. I use it right now with a 9600x and I‚Äôm pushing the last of us part one with the settings cranked as high as they‚Äôll go in 1080p well over 90-120 frames. Keep in mind ray tracing isn‚Äôt available in every game and that‚Äôs the reason (outside of greed) why nvidia costs so much.",

      "It helps a lot and it's doing it with much better results than fsr3.1. if fsr 4 was available for rx 7800 than it will be much simpler choice. But we don't when  it will be (and if it will be because it's not clear)\nFor recent games it's seems like Rx will better choice, but for future releases? Not so sure",
      "As you can see it's hard choice :) \nAbout budget. It's not that I can't afford more expensive card. If I want to I can go and buy 5090 out of the shelf. It's that I think it's not worth it. I'm not heavy player. But I do like to play occasionally. To buy better card I will have to replace screen, cpu ,motherboard, memory and psu to make it sense. So it's pointless to buy better card ither than those two mentioned in my opinion.\nAbout DLLs and performance. My nephew has a rtx 4060 paired with Ryzen 5600.\nI was amazed what this setup can do with dlss on cyberpunk or last of us compared to what I was getting with my 1080ti\nThat the performance that I was looking for.\nAnd I almost bought 4060.\nBut then Intel b580 came out.\nI almost bought it :) . But It was little overpriced at the beginning. So I decided to wait. And then came Nvidia 50xx card release with 5060 announcement.\nI thought I will wait a little bit longer.\nAnd now when it's released I almost bought it :)\nBut I watched YouTube video with comparsion to rx 7800, where red team destroys green:)\nBut it was with very strong processor of course, without using DLLs or fsr , no RT.\nSo after all this digging in internet I still don't know ...

      "I have used both and really only started getting fed up with Nvidia with extreme prices and planned obsolescence because they use a smaller amount of memory. This is on purpose as its not a huge cost. So use what you want. Nobody will be able to afford upgrades soon. Get a card with the most ram.",
      "If you don't want to wait 7800xt.\nAt 4k FSR3.1 is not bad. Yes DLSS is more available but you can always optiscaler to try to inject FSR.\nNewer game that still lack any info can be as bad as optimized as it can be that 5060ti struggle alot even with DLSS and the excess performance of 7800XT might help especially in 4k.\nFor a rather old title, your best bet is using Lossless scaling in my opinion anyway.\nBut since AMD haven't yet release it's 9060xt, there is also option to wait for a bit to see how it's performance and hopefully at that point 5060ti/7800xt price also going down.\nSo more options as well.\n\nFor for now, my pick would be 7800xt.\nUnless you care about RT or efficiency (5060ti is a very efficient card) but probably wait is also a better choice.",
      "I have both. 5060ti in my main rig, and a 7800xt in our lounge gaming PC. I play at 1440p on the main PC, and the 7800xt at 4K in the lounge PC.\n\nThe 7800xt plays games like dragon age Veilguard and AC shadows at 60fps with some settings tweaks or frame gen. I generally steer clear of upscaling as I don‚Äôt like the artifacts it creates and FSR3 is pretty mid, however XeSS can be used by any card just like FSR3, and it looks a lot better imo especially at 4K.\n\nI think the 7800xt is a better option for 4K as it has more brute strength in terms of rasterisation. I‚Äôm happy with what I use it for. \n\nHowever, DLSS4 is very impressive, the best upscaling I‚Äôve seen so far. It‚Äôs not perfect though, there are still artifacts etc, just a lot less than DLSS3. \n\nI personally use the 5060ti for high fps at 1440p, as it has more dials to turn as DLSS is more viable to use. I really don‚Äôt like upscaling in general, but especially at lower resolutions and DLSS is better at lower resolutions. I also chose it as it‚Äôs my main PC and it runs a fair bit more efficiently, and my main PC gets used a lot more than the lounge PC. The 5060ti sits at anywhere between 150-190w whereas the 7800xt is more like 190-250w.\n\nPersonally since you don‚Äôt utilise high fps in either situation, the 7800xt is a better option for you as it‚Äôs more capable at 4K. If DLSS or power efficiency is a major point of contention for you then maybe consider the 5060ti.",

I wanted to play Half Life 2 RTX on atleast 50 fps on max settings but this card is just horrible for its price. I mainly bought it for DLSS and Ray-Tracing purposes but even on those it barely hangs on. So my question here is, is the RTX 5070 worth buying right now or should i buy a different card? Also i saw the RTX 5060 Ti coming soon so lmk if thats something i should consider buying too. I actually dont want any radeons because they don't have DLSS. Thanks in advance!",

      "If you play at 1080p, the 5070 is the best value GPU for path tracing you can buy right now. I have a 5070 paired with a 5700x3d, and it can easily handle the RTX Remix games at high FPS (just finished Portal RTX, which ran at 130+ FPS on ultra with frame gen). It's also great for other path tracing games like Cyberpunk, especially since it has multi-frame gen to hit 200+ FPS.\n\nAt 1080p, the 5070 has roughly the same performance as the 5090 at 4k. I honestly can't recommend it highly enough for 1080p gaming, since the VRAM won't be an issue, plus it's obviously overpowered for non-PT games since it can handle PT, so you won't need to upgrade for a very long time.\n\nIf you play at 1440p, you want the 5080. It's basically the same at 1440p as the 5070 at 1080p.",

Some cheaper PSUs might have a 550w rating but only output up to say 450-500w on the 12v rail.

Which ASUS GeForce RTX 5060 Ti models will be available?**  \nA. With the information I currently have, these models should be available Day 1 or close to it (see the disclaimer in the next question):\n\n* TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB OC\n* ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB OC\n* ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB\n* ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB\n* ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB OC\n\n**Q. Where will ASUS GeForce 5060 Ti cards be available?**  \nA. I'll provide what I can share below, but I've been told that some product is still in transit to certain stores so it's possible that these locations will have them up for sale a bit later. I don't yet have complete model-by-model details yet, so I'll list the general availability that I have. If you're looking where to find a specific model, please look for the Availability section under the model above.\n\n* US - ASUS eShop, Newegg, Amazon, Micro Center, B&H, and Best Buy\n* CA - Canada Computers, Memory Express, and Best Buy (CA)\n\n**Q. Will these all be available on Day 1 as listed?**  \nA. We expect that most, if not all of these will be available at 6am PST for the US. Of course, things happen sometimes and a particular etailer or retailer may have a website issue or may be pending for stock to reach them. Feel free to ask later in the day and we can track this down.\n\n**Q. What about Canada Day 1 sales?**  \nA. For Canada, I do not have confirmation on which stores will have Day 1 stock at this time, unfortunately. If I receive confirmation before the end of the day I will update it.\n\n**Q. I've watched the other launches and never saw \\[insert model\\] go in stock! When will we see \\[insert model\\]?**  \nA. Many of these products are sold out in seconds, so it's very likely that you may not see it go in stock at your preferred place of purchase. As noted above, some products may still be in transit.\n\nWith that said, you can always check with me in the comments below if they went in stock at a particular location, but so far if they've been expected to go live, they have.\n\n**Q. Will there be pre-orders?**  \nA. Not with this launch. If this changes, we'll provide an update.\n\n**Q. Quick! What are the dimensions of the cards?**  \nA. Here you are -\n\nTUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti / 5060 -\n\n* Metric: 302 x 140 x 62 mm\n* Imperial: 11.89 x 5.51 x 2.44 inch\n* Slot Size: 3.1 Slots\n\nASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti ‚Äì\n\n* Metric: 304 x 120 x 50 mm\n* Imperial: 11.97 x 4.72 x 2 inch\n* Slot Size: 2.5 Slot\n\nASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 ‚Äì\n\n* Metric: 268.3 x 120 x 50 mm\n* Imperial: 10.56 x 4.72 x 2 inch\n* Slot Size: 2.5 Slot\n\nASUS Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti ‚Äì\n\n* Metric: 229 x 120 x 50 mm\n* Imperial: 9.02 x 4.72 x 2 inch\n* Slot Size: 2.5 Slot\n\nASUS Dual GeForce RTX 5060 ‚Äì\n\n* Metric: 228 x 123 x 50 mm\n* Imperial: 8.98 x 4.84 x 2 inch\n* Slot Size: 2.5 Slot\n\nHopefully this covers some or all of the questions you might have about the launch. I'll add more if anyone has a good question or a point that needs to be clarified.\n\n  \nEdit: Pricing added and accurate as of 4/16.",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Need affordable GPU upgrade, 9070 XT 16G or 5060 Ti 16G? Any other recommendations (no bs)?\n\n\n\nFor a while now I've had an RX 6600 XT 8G, and it's still a reliable card, but I honestly need an upgrade. My other specs are a Ryzen 5 7600x and 32G of ram so I should be fine on those two, its just the GPU that's the 'problem.' \n\nRight now, I'm on the cusp on either an RX 9070 XT 16G or an RTX 5060 Ti 16G. The only demanding games I want to play right now are Oblivion Remastered and Doom the Dark Ages, literally everything else is fine but would be great with a good upgrade.\n\nWhat's your best recommendation? I'm looking for something that's affordable and also a decent upgrade, I don't have a problem with frame generation unless its a fast paced game. No 'Nvidia vs AMD' bias, please. Suspend any of the bs.\n\n(2am ik, don't mind me, heading to bed soon.)",

      "I'd be more inclined for an upgrade to an RX 9070 XT with your build. The RTX 5060 TI 16GB is worse in most ways than it. But that's if the 9070 is at MSRP. You might be able to find a used RTX 3080 TI a not bad price, which would still beat the 5060 TI. Though you'd be sacrificing 4 extra VRAM.",
      "Would you say it's necessary to upgrade yet? Or should I wait until the next generation? Is the 5060 a good bang for the buck, like still a good upgrade from the 6600?",
      "Also, I play at 1080p, might upgrade to 1440 though.",
      "The RTX 5060 TI 16GB is around a 40% or so upgrade from the RX 6600. Though at 1080p, it wouldn't be worth it to go with 16GB, at 1440p, there definitely is some use cases for 16GB of VRAM. Just don't ever go for 8GB cards. The RTX 4070 can outperform the RTX 5060 TI in most metrics. So unless you can find it for MSRP or under, it'd be smarter to stick to 40 series.\n\n  \nFor Doom: The Dark Ages and especially Oblivion Remastered an upgrade is definitely in order. Oblivion struggles to hit 60 on 1080p medium settings on an RX 6600. If you want a good uplift and good 1440p experience then try to look at the range near the RTX 5070. 12GB's or above should be a requirement.\n\nMy recommendations are: RTX 5070, RX 9070, RX 7900 GRE, and RTX 4070 Super. Any of those should easily be able to push Ultra, 1440p, 60 FPS. If they don't then you can just add some FSR or DLSS and it should easily be able to do it.",
      "Ok, thanks this will really help. Have a good one.",

    "comments": [
      "Why does the Prime have baby fans when the other models don't?  I don't think I've seen those on any other 50 series card.",
      "The 5060 TI 16GB is below MSRP?",
      "no LP model?",
      "Is there any ETA or price info available for the Tuf 5070 Ti BTF White? I know it was announced not long ago too, but I can only find info on the 5060 cards. I already have the matching BTF board on pre-order, so any info would help.",
      "Two reasons. First, there is a matter of perspective. The TUF Gaming is physically larger (35mm longer and 20mm taller) and the Dual only uses two fans, so a larger fan can be used in those instances. Also contributing to the optical difference in fan size is that the ratio of fan hub to blade length is slightly different. The Prime has a smaller hub and longer fan blades to compensate. \n\nThe other reason it's different is because the Prime GeForce RTX 5060 cards are 40mm shorter than even its 5060 Ti cousin, limiting the space to include three fans. That's probably the biggest reason it looks strange to you.",

I'm not concerned about performance differences right now, but rather the *features*.\n\nAre there any differences between these cards in terms of technologies anything else besides raw GB/s and RAM?\n\nAlso, are there any versions of these cards that are more geared towards specific use cases, like the 5090 for studio work or the 5070 for gaming?\n\nBasically, I'm looking for insights on how to categorize the 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, 5070, and the rumored 5060. For example:\n\n* Is the 5090 strictly for professionals or extreme enthusiasts? Why?\n* Is the 5080 good for high-end gaming and some content creation? Why?\n* Where do the 5070 Ti and 5070 fit in?

      "These days there is more nuance than just the number tier system gen to gen. If you compare the entire package of bus, bandwidth, vram, Cuda, etc you find that nvidia gets sly with their naming scheme.\n\nThat's how you get the 4080 at launch last gen that was more of a xx70 card and we didn't get the true xx80 until the super refresh. Same with this gen, xx80 is really more of a xx70 card, but named an xx80 for the pricing. And the xx90 card is more like the previous gen xx90ti. Which is the big issue. The huge gap between the 5080 and 5090 is easily explained by the fact they haven't released the real xx80 this gen which won't come until the 5080S or 5080ti variant launches.",

A 5080 will do everything a 4080 Super did but better and add MFG (if you don't like MFG then don't buy it or any of the next GPUs because they all will be).",

      "All of these cards are gaming GPUs, which means it prioritizes gaming hardware over any work, that doesnt mean you cannot do any productivity workload on them, but it will be less effective than productivity cards.\n\nWhether gaming or productivity for any series, the more you go higher with the number, the better and more powerful the card is as it will have more cores and VRAM ( not all models) than the lower numbered ones.\n\nNow all 50 gaming GPUs support the same features, but the experience while using them is different between lower and high end models, as an example \"multi frame gen\", this works on lower end models but the experience will not be as good as the higher end ones.\n\nAnother example is ray tracing, lower end models have low amount of vram and fewer RT cores than high end ones, so you will not be able to run RT at max quality and will settle on medium or low setting.\n\nAs for productivity, having a high end flagship card like the 5090, which has 32 GB of vram and double the cores of the 5080 is going to be much faster in rendering than the 5080 (16GB), so less time to complete the work and more responsiveness when doing that work.\n\nThe stack goes as:\n\nxx90 = top tier\n\nxx80 = High end\n\nxx70 = mid-range\n\nxx60 = low end\n\nxx50 = crap\n\nAs far as the \"Ti\" or \"Super\" at the end, it means it's within the same GPU class and more powerful, but still less performant than the next tier up in the stack",

Hopefully, once it's out, I can get a used 4070 ti super for a decent price.\n\nI'm still looking at whatever AMD does in a similar performance/price range, but I don't have much hopes.\n\nEDIT: This comment means that I *hope* the prices of used 4070 ti super go down over the next few months (or AMD releases something decent). I don't know why everyone assumes that I'm buying at current prices, or that I'd rather get a 4070 ti super than a 5070 ti for the same price, since that's literally the opposite of what I meant.",
      "Over priced and wrongly named, 5070ti should have been a 5060 ti.",

The production anomaly has been corrected.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Quick Clarification from me:**\n\nIn the response above, NVIDIA mentioned \"one fewer ROP\". In this case, they are referring to the Raster Operation partition. One (1) Raster Operation partition contains the eight (8) missing ROP units.\n\nAlso, if you want to check your 50 Series cards with [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/), below is the **correct** ROPs amounts from [Blackwell whitepaper](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf):\n\n* **RTX 5090** = 176 ROPs (Affected units have 168 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5080 =** 112 ROPs (Affected units have 104 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** = 96 ROPs (Affected units have 88 ROPs)\n\nWe have also seen [someone](https://reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1iwi18d/rtx_5080_missing_rops/) with 8 missing ROPs on his RTX 5080 as well. While the statement from NVIDIA did not mention RTX 5080, if you do have the same issue with any of the 50 Series cards, the path forward is the same and it is to **contact board manufacturers and** **RMA the card**",

      "I'm ready to be so disappointed by linus tech tips or gamersnexus, watch it be an 18% uplift without the new magical fake frames feature",

      "Were any benchmarks shown without frame generation? Also it looks like DLSS4 features are coming to all RTX cards, just not multi-frame gen, which is the least exciting feature imo.",

it may therefore be disputed through other channels;\n\n>**Point 5:** It is true that no exclusions are indicated, and in fact in America even FE cards benefit from this code ‚Äì in our region, NVIDIA does not provide this promotion because it does not sell products directly but through LDLC, which is a vendor like any other and does not participate in this promotion in Italy ‚Äì this too is the response of those with expertise on the matter, and therefore cannot be contested via this channel;\n\n>**Point 6:** In Italy, LDLC is the only one selling Founders Editions, whereas in other countries the Founders Editions are sold by other companies; in Europe, it is not possible to purchase directly from the NVIDIA store and one must go through these resellers; in America, it is possible to purchase directly from the NVIDIA store ‚Äì if you look on the LDLC website, you will not find Founders Editions listed, so the response from LDLC customer service stating ‚Äúonly for customers who placed an order on the LDLC France site‚Äù refers to custom cards, not Founders Editions.\n\n>That said, I understand why you insist, but I reiterate that this information/these responses are final as they come from the competent department.\n\n>Therefore, they cannot be contested through this communication channel, but you may dispute them through consumer protection agencies or other means.\n\n# Here's my answer:\n\n>Thank you for your response, but I cannot accept what you wrote as ‚Äúdefinitive,‚Äù because it contains several statements contradicted by the official Terms and Conditions and by the information published on NVIDIA‚Äôs Italian website. Below I reply point by point:\n\n**01. The existence of the promo page does not prove that FE cards are included**\n\n>Correct: nowhere is it stated that FE cards are included.  \nBut it is also **nowhere stated that they are excluded**. The terms clearly state:\n\n>‚ÄúOffer valid for desktop systems or NVIDIA GeForce RTX‚Ñ¢ 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, 5070 graphics cards‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n>The Founders Edition **is** an RTX 5070. If there were any exclusions, they should have been listed. The absence of such an exclusion is meaningful.\n\n>Moreover, on the product page of the NVIDIA Marketplace, the RTX 5070 Founders Edition displayed the **‚ÄúDOOM INCLUDED‚Äù** banner.\n\n**02. The T&Cs only mention the territory, not the inclusion of FE cards**\n\n>Exactly: they neither exclude nor mention FE cards, but **explicitly include Europe**.\n\n>The fact that the promotion is ‚Äúvalid in Europe at authorized partners and resellers‚Äù implies that purchases made in Europe from such partners (like LDLC) are eligible.\n\n**03. Not all partners participate, and LDLC is not listed at the bottom of the page**\n\n>But the page **does not exclude LDLC** ‚Äî it simply does not mention it among the resellers in the United States and Canada (the list is clearly for the North American region).\n\n>Additionally:\n\n>My card was purchased through the **Italian NVIDIA Marketplace**, **not directly from LDLC‚Äôs website**.\n\n>The **‚ÄúDOOM included‚Äù** banner was visible on the RTX 5070 product page at the time of purchase.\n\n>This is official promotional material, **not a mistake**.\n\n>\n\n>**04. The banner is present, but not related to EMEA**\n\n>This is a very serious statement:\n\n>The banner is on the **Italian NVIDIA Marketplace**, not the American one.\n\n>The website was **localized in Italian** and included the phrase ‚ÄúDOOM incluso‚Äù.\n\n>So NVIDIA **advertised the promotion in Italy, in the Italian language, on a site aimed at the Italian public**, and now claims that the promotion does not apply in this country.\n\n>This is, in effect, **misleading advertising**.\n\n>\n\n>**05. In the U.S. FE cards are included, in Europe they are not**\n\n>Once again:\n\n>If FE cards are excluded in Europe, this **must be stated in the T&Cs**.\n\n>If FE cards are excluded in Europe, they **should not have a banner** indicating they are part of the promotion.\n\n>There is **no clause** that limits the offer to ‚Äúcustom‚Äù cards.\n\n>Stating that the promotion applies in the U.S. but not in Europe, without this distinction being reflected in the official documents, **exposes NVIDIA to legal responsibility**.\n\n>\n\n>**06. FE cards in Europe are not sold directly by NVIDIA, so they are not valid**\n\n>But I did **not** purchase from LDLC.\n\n>I purchased from the **Italian NVIDIA website**.\n\n>And on that site, the **‚ÄúDOOM included‚Äù** banner was present.\n\n>The fact that NVIDIA relies on LDLC for order fulfillment **does not change the nature of the offer made to the consumer**.\n\n>\n\n>**Conclusion**\n\n>The fact that you keep stating that the response is ‚Äúnot open to dispute‚Äù **does not make the claim correct**, nor does it negate the responsibilities that arise from misleading advertising. I will therefore proceed with a **report to AGCM** (the Italian Competition and Market Authority), and if necessary, to the **European Consumer Centre**.\n\n>I remain available in case NVIDIA decides to resolve this issue amicably.\n\n# And again, NVIDIA's response\n\n>\n\nI kindly ask you not to misuse this support service.\n\n>As I have already explained, this is not the appropriate channel to dispute this matter.\n\n>Therefore, I ask you not to proceed any further in this way, as your messages amount to venting dissatisfaction to people who are no longer in a position to help you ‚Äì and that is not the purpose of my job.\n\n>The information I have provided to you is final, and there is no room to contest it through this channel.\n\n>Again, I ask you not to abuse the service being offered to you.\n\n>If you wish to confirm what I have told you, you may contact the channels I‚Äôve already provided:\n\n>[info@nvidia.com](mailto:info@nvidia.com)\n\n>[https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/support/consumer/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/support/consumer/)\n\n>Thank you again for your understanding, and I hope you take into consideration what I have written.\n\n>This case is now considered closed.",

Nor should any cards be affected that were produced more recently: ‚ÄúThe production anomaly has been corrected,‚Äù he says****. In case you‚Äôre wondering, he also told us that* ***Nvidia was not aware of these issues before it launched these GPUs.***\n\n**Here's NVIDIA's Full Amended Statement**:\n\n>*We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.*\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Quick Clarification from me:**\n\nIn the response above, NVIDIA mentioned \"one fewer ROP\". In this case, they are **referring to the Raster Operation partition**. **One (1) Raster Operation partition contains the eight (8) missing ROP units**.\n\nAlso, if you want to check your 50 Series cards with [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/), below is the **correct** ROPs amounts from [Blackwell whitepaper](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf):\n\n* **RTX 5090/5090D** = 176 ROPs (Affected units have 168 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5080 =** 112 ROPs (Affected units have 104 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** = 96 ROPs (Affected units have 88 ROPs)",

      "Gotta love the fact that all those scalpers sitting on unopened boxes don't know if their cards are affected.",
      "Lol \"Rare\"\n\nI love how they also acted as if the results are something that they figured out inside of the company and not through other resources. Where did they get the 0.5% of cards effected? Absolutely out of their ass.\n\nThey either knew, or didn't know and both options are terrible for a \"High-End\" product released by the best company. This, the cables, the poor drivers bricking PC's, fake msrp, fake frames, fires. They have went downhill and need to wake tf up. Reduce the price of cards, fix the quality aspect of your products and be a good monopoly for once.",
      "If Nvidia knows which production defect caused this as some people have speculated, why isn't there communication saying that people who purchased the affected units will be contacted for a refund or replacement rather having to ask?  What percentage of people who end up with a Nvidia GPU have a clue what GPU-Z is?  How was the company able to very rapidly respond with a percentage of cards affected without prior knowledge of the issue?  The most likely explanation is seeming like someone at Nvidia figured out you can ship defective products and most customers will never notice.  I thought we had moved on from the GTX 970 VRAM era shenanigans given the market cap of this company now.  If mainstream media (not tech outlets) get onto this it will not be a great look, even if 85% of revenue is from sources other than gaming now.",
      "If they truly did not know about this, then that is actually scarily bad QA from company of Nvidia's size...\n\n\nBut I doubt that. Probably just pushed all the faulty chips out there in hopes people wouldn't notice or can't be bothered to RMA. Or to improve the already ridiculously bad supply, even if temporarily.\n\n\nWhat a joke this company has become.",
      "Scalpers don't care because the people who buy scalped cards have more money than sense",
      "Not even an apology. And they should make their driver auto inform any card owners the defect.",
      "Lmao what a shit show of a launch",
      "What happened to quality control",
      "100% they knew ahead of time and hoped people wouldn't notice.",
      "Its beyond me how such a large manufacturer does not notice something as easily detected as missing ROPs. Also even if i get a 5090 in 3 months when prices normalize i will still be checking this 100%.",
      "I'd wager that the majority of consumers are not aware of this issue.",
      "Why couldn‚Äôt the error be the other way around",
      "Interesting that NVIDIA has chosen not to offer even an apology for any of this. Just \"too bad, try your luck with RMA.\"\n\nI wonder if they even bothered to let the board partners know that they'll be needing to process these claims.",
      "Since people DM me about the missing ROP, here is what MSI answered me yesterday :\n\n*We're sorry to hear that you're experiencing an issue with your MSI component, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.*¬†  \n*For your convenience, please note that the warranty is exclusively offered through our authorized stores and resellers. To make a warranty claim and have your unit repaired, replaced, or refunded (depending on the available solutions), we kindly request you to contact the store where the item was purchased. They are well equipped to handle warranty claims and will guide you through the process seamlessly.*  \n*Your satisfaction is our top priority, and we want to ensure that you receive the best possible support and service for your MSI product.*  \n*If you have any further questions or require additional assistance, please feel free to reach out to our customer support team.*\n\nOf course I also contacted the reseller but no response so far. Which is strange because they usually answer very quickly.  \nI assume they are waiting for Nvidia/MSI directives about what they may or may not do regarding the warranty / replacement. I'll let you know.\n\nEDIT : The online reseller just contacted me, saying they will replace the card but they have no stock to do so at the moment. They suggest I keep the card for \"a while\" until they got more stock.\n\nSo I guess I'm keeping it for a few months or more. Well at least I'm gonna get a new card later so that's something.",
      "This is a bad look at every angle and these gpus are $2000 premium should have better quality control",
      "I really hope this is sarcasm.",
      "Either their QA sucks or they maliciously sent out broken units. Either way it's another big hit to Nvidia's brand of quality.",
      "4% according to Nvidia. Tests have shown as high as 11%",
      "In otherwords its wider spread than they claim and they knowingly sold faulty dies.\n\nLook back prior to releasing, there was a report on bad batches of wafers, they knew before release and chose to sell them anyway.\n\nAugust last year, reports of low packaging yield threatening release time tables.\n\nThey knew, and they knowingly sold defective dies to meet their release dates.",
      "I am imagining they had such low stock of GPUs for the launch that somebody greenlighted purposely allowing defective cards through because they were gambling that having slightly more stock at launch would be less harmful to reputation and bottom line than some people having defective cards that they can RMA later once there's slightly more stock available.\n\nit sounds insane but i can't imagine a realistic scenario where these defective GPUs went through QA at TSMC and then at Nvidia and then at AIB partners with this problem and still made it to store shelves."

    "selftext": "# GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition reviews are up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3568lwrnwqee1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30ca4f255f94899838a70ab1168949437d3e03fd\n\n# Below is the compilation of all the reviews that have been posted so far. I will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links. This will be sorted alphabetically.\n\n# Written Articles\n\n# [Babeltechreviews](https://babeltechreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)\n\n>For the Blackwell RTX 50 series launch, NVIDIA strategically chose to introduce their flagship model first, launching the GeForce RTX 5090 ahead of other models to set a high benchmark in performance. Following this release, other models like the RTX 5080 and RTX 5070 are set to be launched, all of which we assume will also be impressive with DLSS 4 and their new design. The RTX 5090 remains the pinnacle in terms of raw power and capabilities and is in a class of its own, alongside its high price tag.\n\n>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition‚Äôs powerful performance make it an essential upgrade for enthusiasts and professionals aiming to push the limits of what‚Äôs possible in their digital environments. Purists will not enjoy DLSS 4 and will want a much larger raw performance jump, but for those that do the performance uplift will make you drop your jaw just like it did to ours. We remember titles like Hogwarts Legacy having performance issues at launch and with DLSS 4 enabled we saw incredibly high gains of 301.6 AI generated FPS performance difference over its raw power. Nothing can replace proper optimization but expanding the capabilities of a game to perform in such large amounts is amazing.\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk3fECI-fmw)\n\n>Going into this review, it was clear that there was some trepidation that the RTX 5090 wouldn't offer enough of a performance advantage over its predecessor when it comes to raw frame-rates, ie without the multi frame generation tech that Nvidia leaned heavily on in its pre-release marketing. These are justifiable concerns - after all, there's no die shrink to accompany this generation of processors, and pushing more power can only get you so far.\n\n>Thankfully - for those that want to justify upgrading to a $2000+ graphics card - the beefier design and faster GDDR7 memory do deliver sizeable gains over the outgoing 4090 flagship, measured at around 31 percent on average at 4K. The differentials are understandably smaller when you look at lower resolutions - just 17 percent at 1080p, though anyone considering the 5090 is probably unlikely to be rocking a 1080p display. Nvidia, Intel, AMD and Sony have all spoken about the slowing progress in terms of silicon price to performance, and we can see why all four companies are now¬†[looking to machine learning](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-ps5-pro-tech-interview-with-mark-cerny-and-mike-fitzgerald)¬†technologies to shore up generational advancements.\n\n>Speaking of which, DLSS 4's multi frame generation is an effective tool for pushing frame-rates - though arguably not¬†*performance*¬†to higher levels. On the RTX 5090, it's best used along similarly high-end 4K 144Hz+ monitors, so it's no surprise that Nvidia and its partners ensured that reviewers had access to 4K 240Hz screens for their testing. If you're lucky enough to be in that situation, you can use MFG to essentially max out your monitor's refresh rate, with a choice of 1x, 2x or 3x frame generation.\n\n>There's of course a trade-off in terms of latency, but it's smaller than you might think - and once you've already enabled frame generation, knocking it up an extra level has only a small impact on thos latency figures. For example, in¬†[Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077)¬†with RT Overdrive (path tracing), we saw frame-rates go with 94.5fps with DLSS upscaling to 286fps when adding 4x multi frame generation, a \\~3x multiplier at the cost of \\~9ms of added latency (26ms vs 35ms). If you have a 4K 240Hz monitor, that might be a trade worth taking - and of course, you're more than free to ignore frame generation and knock back other settings instead to get performance to a level you're happy with.\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/review-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-reference-edition/)\n\n>The RTX 5090 features an advanced rendering engine that pushes past previous limits with the help of its¬†¬†21,760 CUDA cores. This means smoother and faster gameplay with more realistic environments, creating an immersive experience.¬†The RTX 50 series introduced a new generation of Ray tracing and Tensor cores. These aren‚Äôt just numbers on a spec sheet ‚Äì they represent a leap in efficiency and power. Located close to the shader engine, these cores work tirelessly to deliver distinctive outputs. Even though Tensor cores can be tricky to measure, their impact is unmistakable, especially when paired with DLSS3.5 and new DLSS4 with MFG¬† technology that delivers impressive results.¬†The GeForce RTX 5090 is not just an enthusiast-class card; it's a versatile powerhouse. Whether playing games at 2K (2560x1440) or better yet, game at 4K (3840x2160), it offers superlative performance at every resolution. This makes it an outstanding choice for gamers who seek both quality and speed, transporting them into new realms of interactive entertainment\n\n>Depending on the game title this value can greatly differ! However, on average you're looking at 25% maybe 30% more traditional rendering performance.¬†The thing is though, NVIDIA has invested a lot of the transistor budget into AI, Deeplearning and Neural shading. We've presented the numbers with DLSS4 and when you enable frame generation mode at 4x, the performance is astounding.¬†The reality is that we are reaching physical limits where traditional methods of increasing performance are becoming harder than ever. Chips would have to grow even larger, power consumption would skyrocket, and costs would soar.¬†Imagine a future where every attempt to push technology further leads to larger, more power-hungry chips that become increasingly expensive. As we encounter these boundaries, think creatively and seek new solutions. Instead of following a path that leads to dead ends, this challenge invites us to innovate and discover groundbreaking ideas such as DLSS4 and MFG.\n\n>If you factor out pricing and energy consumption, it's gonna be hard to not be impressed with the GeForce RTX 5090. The card drips and oozes performance and it all packs into a two-slot form factor. On the traditional shader rasterizer part, it's still a good notch faster than RTX 4090, however, if you are savvy with technologies like DLSS4 offers, the sky is the limit. We do hope to see more backwards compatibility with DLSS 4 so that older games will get this new tech included as well. DLSS4 is not perfect though, yes butter smooth, but in Alan Wake 2 for example the scene rendered was fantastic but we; see birds flying over in the sky leaving a weird hale trail. The scene was otherwise very nice though.¬†¬†The Blackwell GPU architecture of the 5090 demonstrates proficient performance. It boasts about 1.25 to sometimes 1.50 times the raw shader performance compared to its predecessor, along with enhanced Raytracing and Tensor core capabilities.\n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review)\n\n>NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090 is the fastest, most powerful, and feature-rich consumer GPU in the world as of today, period. There‚Äôs no other way to put it. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition card itself is also a refined piece of hardware. To design a card that offers significantly more performance than an RTX 4090, at much higher power levels, in a roughly 33% smaller form factor is no small feat of engineering. The card also looks great in our opinion. On its own, the GeForce RTX 5090 is currently unmatched in the consumer GPU market ‚Äì nothing can touch it in terms of performance, with virtually any workload ‚Äì AI, content creation, gaming, you name it.\n\n>It's not all sunshine and rainbows, though. In many cases, the GeForce RTX 5090 offered nearly double the performance of its predecessor (RTX 3090) when it debuted, at lower power, while using the exact same settings and workloads. If you compare the GeForce RTX 5090 to the RTX 4090 at like settings, however, the RTX 5090 is ‚Äúonly‚Äù about 25% - 40% faster and consumes more power. The RTX 5090‚Äôs $1,999 MSRP is also significantly higher than the 4090‚Äôs $1,599 price tag. Considering the Ada and¬†[Blackwell GPUs](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-architecture-overview)¬†at play here are manufactured on the same TSMC process node, NVIDIA was still able to move the needle considerably, but the GeForce RTX 5090 doesn‚Äôt represent the same kind of monumental leap the RTX 4090 did when it launched, if you disregard its new rendering technologies at least.\n\n>You can‚Äôt disregard those new capabilities, though. Neural Rendering, DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, the updated media engine, and all that additional memory and memory bandwidth all have to be taken into consideration. When playing a game that can leverage Blackwell‚Äôs new features, the GeForce RTX 5090 can indeed be more than twice as fast as¬†[the RTX 4090](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-gpu-review).\n\n>The use of frame generation has spurred much discussion since its introduction, and we understand the concerns regarding input latency and potential visual artifacts that come from using frame-gen. But the fact remains, using AI and machine learning to boost game and graphics performance in the most effective and efficient way forward at this time. Moving to more advanced manufacturing process nodes doesn‚Äôt offer the kind of power, performance and area benefits it once did, so boosting performance must ultimately come mostly from architectural and feature updates. And everyone in the PC graphics game is turning to AI. We specifically asked about the importance of traditional rasterization moving forward and were told development is still happening, and it will remain necessary for ‚Äúground truth‚Äù rendering to train the models, but ultimately AI will be generating more and more frames in the future.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review-the-600-watt-powerhouse-in-gaming-and-lab-tests/)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5090 delivered impressive results in practical tests. The card achieved significantly higher frame rates in Full HD, WQHD and Ultra HD compared to the RTX 4090, especially with DLSS and ray tracing support enabled. The multi-frame generation enables consistent frame pacing and reduces noticeable latency, which is particularly beneficial in fast and dynamic gaming scenarios. The improvements in patch tracing and ray tracing ensure a more realistic representation of complex scenes. Games such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2 visibly benefit from the technological advances and show that the Blackwell architecture has the potential to smoothly display the most demanding graphic effects.\n\n>The image quality achieved by the Transformer models in DLSS 4 is another important aspect. Where previously a clear trade-off had to be made between performance and quality, DLSS 4 combines both in an impressive way. Most notably, the new Performance setting offers almost the same visual quality as previous Quality modes. This is achieved through advanced AI-powered models that capture both local details and global relationships to produce a near-native image representation. The smooth and detailed rendering at significantly higher frame rates shows that DLSS 4 is an essential part of the RTX 5090, further underlining its performance. There will be a detailed practical test on this from our monitor professional Fritz Hunter.\n\n>In my opinion, the GeForce RTX 5090 is an impressive graphics card that shows just how far GPU technology has come. The new features in particular, such as DLSS 4 and Transformer-supported image optimization, set new standards. The performance of this card is simply breathtaking, be it in games in Ultra HD with active patch tracing or in demanding AI-supported applications. It is remarkable how NVIDIA has managed to find the balance between graphical excellence and innovative technologies. Another outstanding aspect is the ability of DLSS 4 to achieve an image quality that is almost indistinguishable from native resolutions, while at the same time increasing performance. The change from ‚ÄúQuality‚Äù to ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù as a standard option is like a revolution in the way we perceive image enhancement. The smooth display, combined with an incredible level of detail, takes the gaming experience to a new level.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-ray-tracing-dlss-4-and-raw-power-explored/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wEXrZSnsRM)\n\n>Much was made of the performance ahead of launch, people were breaking out rulers and¬†[pixel counting Nvidia's bar charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1hvvrqj/50_vs_40_series_nvidia_benchmark_exact_numbers/), but after thorough testing today we can confirm native rendering performance has increased in the ballpark of 30% over the RTX 4090 when testing at 4K. That makes the RTX 5090 64% faster on average compared to AMD's current consumer flagship, the RX 7900 XTX, while it's also a 71% uplift over the RTX 4080 Super. Ray tracing also scales similarly, given we saw the exact same 29% margin over the RTX 4090 in the eight RT titles we tested.\n\n>Those are the sort of performance increases you can expect at 4K, but the uplift does get progressively smaller as resolution decreases. Versus the RTX 4090, for instance, we saw smaller gains of 22% at 1440p and 18% at 1080p. Now, I don't expect many people will be gaming at native 1080p on an RTX 5090, but it's worth bearing that in mind if you'd typically game with DLSS Super Resolution. After all, using its performance mode at 4K utilises a 1080p internal render resolution. Clearly this is a card designed for 4K ‚Äì and perhaps even above ‚Äì but that performance scaling at lower resolutions could be something to bear in mind.\n\n>Of course, whether or not you are impressed by those generational gains depends entirely on your perspective ‚Äì an extra 30% over the 4090 could sound great, or it could be a disappointment. The main thing from my perspective as a reviewer is to give you, the reader, as much information as possible to allow you to make an informed decision, and I think I have done that today.\n\n>Gamers do get the extra value add of DLSS 4, specifically Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is a new feature exclusive to the RTX 50-series. I spent a fair bit of time testing MFG as part of this review and I think if you already got on with Frame Generation on the RX 40-series, you'll probably find a lot to like with MFG. It's been particularly useful in enabling 4K/240Hz gaming experiences that wouldn't otherwise be possible ‚Äì such as high frame rate path tracing in Cyberpunk 2077 ‚Äì and with the growing¬†[4K OLED monitor segment](https://www.kitguru.net/components/matthew-wilson/ces-2025-leo-gets-a-closer-look-at-new-msi-oled-monitors-dual-system-case-and-more/), that's certainly good news.\n\n>However, it's definitely not a perfect technology as the discerning gamer will still notice some fizzling or shimmering that isn't otherwise there, while latency scaling is still backwards compared to what we've come to expect ‚Äì in the sense that latency actually¬†*increases*¬†as frame rate increases with MFG, rather than latency decreasing. That means some will find it problematic as the¬†*feel*¬†doesn't always match up to the visual fluidity of the increased frame rate.\n\n>It is great to see Nvidia is improving other aspects of DLSS, though, with its new Transformer-based models of Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. Not only do these improve things like ghosting and overall level of detail compared to the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, but this upgrade actually applies to¬†*all*¬†RTX GPUs, right the way back to the 20-series. There's even a possibility that Multi Frame Gen¬†[might come to older cards](https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/joao-silva/nvidia-multi-frame-generation-could-come-to-rtx-30-series-gpus/)¬†given that Nvidia hasn't explicitly ruled it out, but personally I'd be surprised to see that happen given it currently acts as an incentive to upgrade to the latest and greatest.\n\n>We can't end this review without a discussion of Nvidia's Founders Edition design, either. This is a¬†*highly*¬†impressive feat of engineering, considering it's a mere dual-slot thickness yet it is able to comfortably tame 575W of power. We saw the GPU settling at 72C during a thirty-minute 4K stress test, while the VRAM hit 88C, which is slightly warmer but still well within safe limits. I love to see the innovation in this department, as when pretty much every AIB partner is slapping quad-slot coolers onto their 5090s, this is a refreshing step back to a time when GPUs didn't cover the entire bottom-half of your motherboard.\n\n# [LanOC](https://lanoc.org/review/video-cards/9132-nvidia-rtx-5090-founders-edition)\n\n>Performance for the new generation of cards in my testing had the RTX 5090 outperforming the RTX 4090 by around 32% which is right in line with the increase in CUDA cores for the card. There were some tests which saw an even bigger increase and the RTX 5090 was at the top of the chart across the board in every applicable test. What was even more impressive to me was the improvements with DLSS 4, the performance difference that it can make is sometimes shocking, but on top of that Nvidia has improved the smoothness and picture quality. At the end of the day, there wasn‚Äôt anything that I threw at the RTX 5090 that slowed it down, but if you do run into something that it can‚Äôt handle DLSS 4 is going to fix you right up. I did see some bugs in my DLSS testing, mostly when trying down resolutions, but I suspect some of those will be smoothed out once the updates are released. The biggest issue I ran into performance-wise was that a few of our benchmarks just wouldn‚Äôt run at all and they were all OpenCL. Nvidia is aware and is working to get support for those tests.\n\n>The big increase in performance without any change in manufacturing size does have the RTX 5090 having a significantly higher power consumption. I saw it pulling up to 648 watts at peak, combine that with today's highest-end CPUs and we are swinging back to needing high-wattage power supplies. Speaking of power, the power connection has been improved in a whole list of ways including moving from the original 12VHPWR connection to the changed design that is called 12V-2-6. It looks the same and all of the power supplies will still connect. But they have changed the pin heights to get a better connection and the sense pins are shorter and are more likely to catch when the plug isn‚Äôt connected all the way. On top of that Nvidia‚Äôs card design has recessed the connection down into the card and angled it to reduce any strain on the connection. They have also included a much nicer power adapter as well. All of that power does mean there is more heat but the double blow-through design handled it surprisingly well running similarly in temperatures to the RTX 4090 Founders Edition even with a thinner card design and a lot more wattage going through.\n\n# [OC3D Article](https://overclock3d.net/reviews/gpu_displays/nvidia-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oDxME5APa8)\n\n>Speaking of DLSS 4, that comes with the big ticket item in the Blackwell release, Multi Frame Generation. By refining the algorithm, and giving the card newer generations of hardware, the RTX 5090 can now generate three extra frames from a single frame rendered. As you could see from our results in Alan Wake II, Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, the effect is considerable. Cyberpunk 2077, with an open world, neon soaked, usually wet and thus reflective environment is about as good as games can look. Turn on path-tracing and it‚Äôs nearly real life. That path-tracing has a massive performance cost though. On the RTX 4090 you get 133 FPS @ 4K without it, 40 FPS with it.\n\n>Even turning DLSS and Frame Gen on doesn‚Äôt recoup all that, maxing out at 104. Click through the Multi Frame Gen settings on the RTX 5090 though and that number hits 241 FPS. With, and we cannot state this enough, NO loss in visual fidelity. That‚Äôs Cyberpunk at 4K with pathed ray-tracing turned on and a frame rate you‚Äôd require a very expensive monitor (4K@240Hz!) to appreciate fully. When CD Projekt Red‚Äôs Magnum Opus first appeared you could get smoother frame rates from a flipbook.\n\n>All of which returns us to the way we‚Äôve tested how we have. Because in regular mode, with DLSS turned on and, at most, a single frame generated as is currently the way, the RTX 5090 is another big step forwards on the best of the current cards. Anything which can stomp on a RTX 4090 is crazy good. That the RTX 5090 Founders Edition can do that, and then has much further to go with the benefits of MFG, makes any claims about it being a purely software-based improvement look as ill-informed as they do.\n\n>Already that‚Äôs more than enough to make the Nvidia RTX 5090 Founders Edition a Day One recommendation to anyone serious about their gaming. We haven‚Äôt even mentioned the crazy low latencies ‚Äì and thus higher KD ratio ‚Äì of the upgraded Reflex 2 technology. Or RTX Neural Faces that can convert a 2D picture into a 3D character. We‚Äôve not discussed, because it‚Äôs embryonic, the potential of the AI powered NPCs with the Nvidia Ace technology. Or the extra broadcast features, faster encoding and decoding, and all the AI calculation benefits having this much power at your disposal can bring.\n\n>Simply put, the Nvidia RTX 5090 has coalesced all the current thinking on AI, performance, sharpness, and generative content into a single card that blows the doors off anything on the market. It‚Äôs the future, today.\n\n# [PC Perspective](https://pcper.com/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)\n\n>Well, NVIDIA has topped NVIDIA. Once again, and with zero competition at the high end, GeForce reigns supreme. And while raster performance has risen, DLSS 4 is the star of the show with the RTX 50 Series, now supporting up to¬†***four***¬†generated frames per rendered frame (!) if you dare. Yes, the price for NVIDIA‚Äôs flagship has risen again, from $1599 to $1999 this generation, but those who want the fastest graphics card in the world will surely buy it anyway.\n\n# [PC World Article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J5wDq2ba2E)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 4090 stood unopposed as the ultimate gaming GPU since the moment it launched. No longer. The new Blackwell generation uses the same underlying TSMC 4N process technology as the RTX 40-series, so Nvidia couldn‚Äôt squeeze easy improvements there. Instead, the company overhauled the RTX 5090‚Äôs instruction pipeline, endowed it with 33 percent more CUDA cores, and pushed it to a staggering 575W TGP, up from the 4090‚Äôs 450W. Blackwell also introduced a new generation of RT and AI cores.\n\n>Add it all up and the RTX 5090 is an unparalleled gaming beast ‚Äî though the effects hit different depending on whether or not you‚Äôre using RTX features like ray tracing and DLSS.\n\n>In games that¬†*don‚Äôt*¬†use ray tracing or DLSS, simply brute force graphics rendering, the RTX 5090 isn‚Äôt much more than a mild generational performance upgrade. It runs an average of 27 percent faster in those games ‚Äî but the splits swing wildly depending on the game:¬†*Cyberpunk 2077*¬†is 50 percent faster,¬†*Shadow of the Tomb Raider*¬†is 32 percent faster, and¬†*Rainbox Six Siege*¬†is 28 percent faster, but¬†*Assassin‚Äôs Creed Valhalla*¬†and¬†*Call of Duty: Black Ops 6*¬†only pick up 15 and 12 percent more performance, respectively.\n\n>Much like DLSS, DLSS 2, and DLSS 3 before it, the¬†[new DLSS 4 generation](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&xs=1&url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/&xcust=2-1-2585806-1-0-0-0-0&sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html)¬†is an absolute game-changer. Nvidia‚Äôs boundary-pushing AI tech continues to look better, run faster, and now¬†*feel*¬†smoother. It‚Äôs insane.\n\n>Nvidia made two monumental changes to DLSS to coincide with the RTX 50-series release. First, all DLSS games will be switching to a new ‚ÄúTransformer‚Äù model from the older ‚ÄúConvolutional Neural Network‚Äù behind the scenes, on all RTX GPUs going back to the 20-series.\n\n>More crucially for the RTX 5090 (and future 50-series offerings), DLSS 4 adds a new Multi Frame Generation technology, building upon the success of¬†[DLSS 3 Frame Gen](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html). While DLSS 3 uses tensor cores to insert a single AI-generated frame between GPU-rendered frames, supercharging performance, MFG inserts¬†*three*¬†AI frames between each GPU-rendered frame (which itself may only be rendering an image at quarter resolution, then using DLSS Super Resolution to upscale that to fit your screen).\n\n>Bottom line: DLSS 4 is a stunning upgrade you¬†*must*¬†play around with to fully appreciate its benefits. It‚Äôs literally a game-changer, once again ‚Äî though we‚Äôll have to see if it feels¬†*this*¬†sublime on lower-end Nvidia cards like the more affordable RTX 5070.\n\n>In a vacuum, the RTX 5090 delivers around a 30 percent average boost in gaming performance over the RTX 4090. That‚Äôs a solid generational improvement, but one we‚Äôve seen throughout history delivered at the same price point as the older, slower outgoing hardware. Nvidia asking for an extra $500 on top seems garish and overblown from that perspective.\n\n>While I wouldn‚Äôt recommend upgrading to this over the RTX 4090 for gaming (unless you‚Äôre giddy to try DLSS 4), it‚Äôs a definite upgrade option for the RTX 3090 and anything older. The 4090 was 55 to 83 percent faster than the 3090 in games, and the 5090 is about 30 percent faster than¬†*that*, with gobs more memory.\n\n>At the end of the day, nobody needs a $2,000 graphics card to play games. But if you¬†*want*¬†one and don‚Äôt mind the sticker price, this is easily the most powerful, capable graphics card ever released. The GeForce RTX 5090 is a performance monster supercharged by DLSS 4‚Äôs see-it-to-believe it magic.\n\n# [Puget Systems (Content Creation Review)](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-content-creation-review/)\n\n>Overall, the RTX 5090 is a beast of a card. Drawing 575 W, with 32 GB VRAM and a $2000 price tag (at least), it is overkill for many use cases. However, it excels at GPU-heavy workloads like rendering and provides solid performance improvements over the last-gen 4090 in many applications. There are some issues with software compatibility that need to be worked out, but historically, NVIDIA has been great about ensuring its products are properly supported throughout the software ecosystem.\n\n>For¬†**video editing and motion graphics**, the RTX 5090 performs well, with 10-20% improvements across the board. In particular sub-tests, where the workload is primarily GPU bound, we see up to 35% performance advantages over the previous-generation 4090. However, the area we are most excited about is actually the enhanced codec support for the NVENC/NVDEC engines. In DaVinci Resolve, the H.265 4:2:2 10-bit processing was more than twice as fast as software decoding and exceeded even what we see from Intel Quick Sync. Even if the 5090 is more than a workload requires, we are excited to see what this means for upcoming 50-series cards.\n\n>In¬†**rendering applications**, real-time and offline, the 5090 pushes its lead over previous-generation cards even further. It is 17% faster than the 4090 in our Unreal Engine benchmark while also offering more VRAM for heavy scenes. Offline renderers, such as V-Ray and Blender, score 38% and 35% higher than 4090, respectively. This more than justifies the $2,000 MSRP, especially factoring in the added VRAM. The lack of support for some of our normally-tested rendering engines is non-ideal, but we are hopeful NVIDIA will address that issue shortly.\n\n>NVIDIA‚Äôs new GeForce RTX 5090 is a monster of a GPU, delivering best-in-class performance alongside a rich feature set. However, it comes along with a huge price tag of $2,000 MSRP; ad likely higher for most buyers, as AIB cards will be a good bit more expensive than that. It also requires that your computer can support that much power draw and heat. If you need the most powerful consumer GPU ever made, this is it. Otherwise, we are excited by what this promises for the rest of the 50-series of GPUs and look forward to testing those in the near future.\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition/)\n\n>At 4K resolution, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 35% performance uplift over the RTX 4090. While this is certainly impressive, it is considerably less than what we got from RTX 3090 Ti to RTX 4090 (+51%). NVIDIA still achieves their \"twice the performance every second generation\" rule: the RTX 5090 is twice as fast as the RTX 3090 Ti. There really isn't much on the market that RTX 5090 can be compared to, it's 75% faster than AMD's flagship the RX 7900 XTX. AMD has confirmed that they are not going for high-end with RDNA 4, and it's expected that the RX 9070 Series will end up somewhere between RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 GRE. This means that RTX 5090 is at least twice as fast as AMD's fastest next-generation card. Compared to the second-fastest Ada card, the RTX 4080 Super, the performance increase is 72%--wow!\n\n>There really is no question, RTX 5090 is the card you want for 4K gaming at maximum settings with all RT eye candy enabled. I guess you could run the card at 1440p at insanely high FPS, but considering that DLSS 4 will give you those FPS even at 4K, the only reason why you would want to do that is if you really want the lowest latency with the highest FPS.\n\n>Want lower latency? Then turn on DLSS 4 Upscaling, which lowers the render resolution and scales up the native frame. In the past there were a lot of debates where DLSS upscaling image quality is good enough, some people even claimed \"better than native\"--I strongly disagree with that--I'm one of the people who are allergic to DLSS 3 upscaling, even at \"quality.\" With Blackwell, NVIDIA is introducing a \"Transformers\" upscaling model for DLSS, which is a major improvement over the previous \"CNN\" model. I tested Transformers and I'm in love. The image quality is so good, \"Quality\" looks like native, sometimes better. There is no more flickering or low-res smeared out textures on the horizon. Thin wires are crystal clear, even at sub-4K resolution! You really have to see it for yourself to appreciate it, it's almost like magic. The best thing? DLSS Transformers is available not only on GeForce 50, but on all GeForce RTX cards with Tensor Cores! While it comes with a roughly 10% performance hit compared to CNN, I would never go back to CNN. While our press driver was limited to a handful of games with DLSS 4 support, NVIDIA will have around 75 games supporting it on launch, most through NVIDIA App overrides, and many more are individually tested, to ensure best results. NVIDIA is putting extra focus on ensuring that there will be no anti-cheat drama when using the overrides.\n\n# [The FPS Review](https://www.thefpsreview.com/2025/01/23/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-video-card-review/)\n\n>There is a lot to unpack in regards to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, and GeForce RTX 50 series from NVIDIA. A lot of technologies have been debuted, and there are a lot of features to test that we simply cannot do in one single review. In today‚Äôs review, we focused on the gameplay performance aspect of the GeForce RTX 5090.\n\n>We focused on the GeForce RTX 5090 performance, so subsequent reviews will focus on the rest of the family, and we‚Äôll have to see how they fit into the overall opinion of the RTX 50 series family this generation. For now, we can look at the GeForce RTX 5090 as the flagship of the RTX 50 series, and what it offers for the gameplay experience at a steep price of $1,999, a 25% price bump over the previous generation GeForce RTX 4090.\n\n>If we look back at the average performance gains we saw in just regular raster performance, we experienced performance that ranged from 19%-48%, but there were a lot of common performance gains in the 30-33% range. We did have some outliers that were lower, and some higher, depending on the game and settings. We generally saw gains in the 30% region with Ray Tracing enabled, where scenarios were more GPU-bound.\n\n>We think one problem that is being encountered is that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 is becoming CPU-bound in a lot of games. The data tells us that perhaps even our AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is holding back the potential of the GeForce RTX 5090. Therefore, as newer, faster CPU generations are released, the GeForce RTX 5090‚Äôs performance advantage may increase over time. The GeForce RTX 5090 has powerful specifications, but the performance advantage we are currently seeing seems shy of what should be expected with those specifications. It may very well be the case that it is being held back, and it has more potential with better-optimized games or faster CPUs. Time will tell on that one.\n\n>As it stands right now, you should always buy based on the current level of performance, not what might happen. Therefore, at this time you are seeing about a 33% gameplay performance advantage average, but with a 25% price increase, making the price-to-performance value very narrow. The facts are, that the GeForce RTX 5090 has no competition, it does offer the best gameplay performance you can get on the desktop.\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review)\n\n>The RTX 5090 is a lot like this initial review: It's a bit of a messy situation ‚Äî a work in progress. We're not done testing, and Nvidia isn't done either. Certain games and apps need updates and/or driver work. Nvidia usually does pretty good with drivers, but new architectures can change requirements in somewhat unexpected ways, and Nvidia needs to continue to work on tuning and optimizing its drivers. We're also sure Nvidia doesn't need us to tell it that.\n\n>Gaming performance is very much about running 4K and maxed out settings. If you only have a 1440p or 1080p display, you're better off saving your pennies and upgrading you monitor ‚Äî and probably the rest of your PC as well! ‚Äî before spending a couple grand on a gaming GPU.\n\n>Unless you're also interested in non-gaming applications and tasks, particularly AI workloads. If that's what you're after, the RTX 5090 could be a perfect fit.\n\n>The RTX 5090 is the sort of GPU that every gamer would love to have, but few can actually afford. If we're right and the AI industry starts picking up 5090 cards, prices could end up being even higher. Even if you have the spare change and can find one in stock (next week), it still feels like drivers and software could use a bit more time baking before they're fully ready.\n\n>Due to time constraints, we haven't been able to fully test everything we want to look at with the RTX 5090. We'll be investigating the other areas in the coming days, and we'll update the text, charts, and the score as appropriate. For now, the score stands as it is until our tests are complete.\n\n# [Computerbase - German](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-test.91081/)\n\n# [HardwareLuxx - German](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65361-die-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-im-test.html)\n\n# [PCGH - German](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5090-Grafikkarte-281029/Tests/Reviews-Benchmarks-Vergleich-RTX-4090-1463971/)\n\n# [Elchapuzasinformatico - Spanish](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n# Video Review\n\n# [Der8auer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4EdRPT_Mg)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk3fECI-fmw)\n\n# [Gamers Nexus Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWSlOC_jiLQ)\n\n# [Hardware Canucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TJk_P2A0Iw)\n\n# [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA5lFiP3mrs)\n\n# [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulUZ7bf_MXI)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wEXrZSnsRM)\n\n# [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nryZwnVYpns)\n\n# [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q82tQJyJwgk)\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oDxME5APa8)\n\n# [Optimum Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YJNFREQHiw)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J5wDq2ba2E)\n\n# [Techtesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srQHBeWnQzw)\n\n# [Tech Notice (Creators Benchmark)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah0JxguHdp4)\n\n# [Tech Yes City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv-lMrKiwyk=)",

And this is stepping down to the 70 to, looking at the new 80 is even more ridiculous.\n\nSo imagine a Tuff 4080 being sold and listed for $1300+. Bottom of the barrel AIBs for a premium price.

Read here!\n\n**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**\n\nThere is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that‚Äôs if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what‚Äôs going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).\n\n**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**\n\n**Common Troubleshooting Steps**\n\n* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11\n* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.\n* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance\n\nIf it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:\n\n* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.\n* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it‚Äôs difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.\n* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.\n\nIf you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.\n\n**Common Questions**\n\n* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there‚Äôs no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*\n\n**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**\n\n* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*\n* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*\n* **What does the new Power Management option ‚ÄúOptimal Power‚Äù means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*\n\nRemember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.\n\n*Did you know NVIDIA has a Developer Program with 150+ free SDKs, state-of-the-art Deep Learning courses, certification, and access to expert help. Sound interesting?* [Learn more here](https://nvda.ws/3wCfH6X)*.*",

Rolling back to 566.36 drivers fixes the issue for me, but then I am locked out of certain games (e.g. Half Life 2 RTX) and newer features, which will become worse over time.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1idme1q/game_ready_studio_driver_57216_faqdiscussion/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1ioiqls/game_ready_driver_57242_faqdiscussion/mcs3lvi/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1itydor/game_ready_driver_57247_faqdiscussion/mdtknx2/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1izfyyw/game_ready_studio_driver_57260_faqdiscussion/mf2ltbl/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1j4284t/game_ready_driver_57270_faqdiscussion/mg54jnr/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1jeddbc/game_ready_studio_driver_57283_faqdiscussion/mii6cdn/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1je4hjy/halflife_2_rtx_demo_recommended_specs_optimal/mihx4kw/\n\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/560098/geforce-grd-57283-feedback-thread-released-31825/\n\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/557942/572xx-system-rebooting-crashes-when-frame-generati/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1jhksyv/psa_widespread_black_screen_or_hard_os_crash/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1jhkzxo/psa_nvidia_widespread_black_screen_or_hard_os/\n\n**My Experience**\n\nWindows Version: Windows 11 Pro 24H2\n\nBuild: 26100.3476\n\nNvidia Driver Version: 572.83\n\nSystem Configuration: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D\n\nMotherboard: ASUS X570 TUF WIFI\n\nRAM: 32 GB\n\nGraphics Card: ASUS RTX 4070 Ti Super TUF\n\nDisplay: Alienware AW3225QF 4K 240 Hz G-Sync Compatible\n\nPower Supply: Corsair RM850x\n\n\nProblem: Cyberpunk 2077 will crash entire PC.

The price-to-performance ratio of the RTX 5080 is impressive, especially when viewed against the backdrop of NVIDIA‚Äôs previous generations or its current competitors. There is a uplift gen-over-gen of around 7-15% on average in raw power, when you consider DLSS 4 and its incredible uplift for max settings its really exciting. DLSS 4 is not perfect, however, and it cannot replace raw power for enthusiasts. The RTX 5080 also carries a higher price tag, albeit lower than the RTX 4080‚Äôs MSRP at $200 less. This is much better and the value it offers in enhanced performance, especially with advancements in ray tracing and AI-driven capabilities like DLSS 4, justifies the investment in our opinion.\n\n>We understand the inclination to wait for the more budget-friendly 70 and 80 class GPUs from the Blackwell generation, as these models often strike a balance between cost and performance, catering to the needs of the average gamer. However, for those seeking the pinnacle of current gaming technology, the RTX 5080 is unparalleled in its price range and class. It‚Äôs designed to deliver top-tier performance for years to come, making it an investment in future-proofing your gaming or creative setup. Ultimately, the decision to invest in such a high-end GPU depends on your specific needs and budget, but for those who prioritize leading-edge technology, the RTX 5080 is a wonderful new addition to the market.\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7hDtGh0wIo)\n\n>See Stickied Comment\n\n# [eTeknix Article](https://www.eteknix.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-review/)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKhoBBX2h00)\n\n>See Stickied Comment\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/review-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-reference/)\n\n>Depending on the game, performance improvements can vary widely. On average, you can expect a 10 to 25 percent boost in traditional rendering performance coming from a 4080S. The more effective part is NVIDIA's heavy investment in AI, deep learning, and neural shading. When we tested DLSS4 with frame generation enabled at 4x, the performance is simply incredible. However, the pressing question arises: will consumers be ready to invest in AI-assisted rendering? The answer isn‚Äôt clear yet, but time will tell. One thing is certain‚ÄîDLSS4 works wonders. The performance metrics shown are a testament to its power. This GPU is quintessential for gamers using Ultra-Wide HD, Quad HD, or Ultra HD monitors, delivering a great visual experience with framerates to match. But yes, overall from the shading rasterization performance, the card is somewhat lacklustre\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5080 will speak to a lot more people compared to the $1999 costing RTX 5090. However, you'll get far less performance. Compared to the RTX 4080/4080 Super the overall rasterizer performance is a notch faster, but not heaps, and that is today's most disappointing news. NVIDIA invested heavily in the transistor budget for AI, the new generation of products places a strong focus on Raytracing, Neural Shading and of course DLSS4 with MFG (Multi Frame Generation). The combination of these together can easily bring in a fact x3 or x4 (and sometimes faster) result. Whether or not the end user is ready for artificially created frames in this degree we doubt, but as far as NVIDIA is concerned, it's the future.¬†We do hope to see more backwards compatibility with DLSS 4 so that older games will get this new tech included as well.¬†We stated this in the RTX 5090 review already, we wonder if the balance hasn't shifted towards AI assistance a bit too much.¬†For the end-user change and thus a move away from the traditional render engine it will be a tough pill to swallow.¬†The potential is huge though. For example, games like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, when combined with 4.0, could achieve over 150+ FPS at Ultra HD. Similarly, Cyberpunk in UHD did \\~180 FPS, that's with raytracing enabled.¬†The recent move towards Ray reconstruction also moved NVIDIA into a new sweet spot.¬†All features and performance combined with new technology like DLSS4 really make the Series 5000 from NVIDIA compelling. Other downsides for today's tested product have to be the high energy consumption and price level.¬†In the end whatever we write, or how we feel about the AI-driven content doesn't matter. It's you guys that make the decisive purchase or not which makes this product series a success. The product is a notch faster than the previous generation if you look at that traditional render engine, however looking just that alone is not enough. With a whole lot of extra AI driver functionality that comes along with it, boosting your game FPS towards very high levels in the highest resolutions is possible with the likes of DLSS4 and MFG. Realistically though an RTX 4000 card with DLSS3.5 and Frame Generation will get you plenty of AI-driven performance as well.¬†The founder card itself is lovely in design, it looks nice and it is reasonably silent. The power usage is somewhat icky. If you're coming from the RTX 3000 series or lower products, then this might be an attractive enough buy, but I think many of you expected to see RTX 4090 performance, or even slightly better. For that, you'll need a premium AIC OC version with a premium price.¬†\n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-blackwell-review)\n\n>Last week‚Äôs launch of the¬†[GeForce RTX 5090](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review), crowned a new king in the gaming GPU market. It‚Äôs pricier and consumes more power than its predecessor, but the RTX 5090 was performance leader across the board. The GeForce RTX 5080 is also technically an upgrade over the RTX 4080 in virtually every way, but its power consumption is in the same ball park and its introductory $999 MSRP is actually somewhat lower. That should be a great story, but the GeForce RTX 5080 is only a mild upgrade over its previous-gen namesake for gaming, unless you can turn on all DLSS features with multi-frame generation. It does, however, offer more of a boost with AI and content creation workloads.\n\n>When the GeForce RTX 4080 launched, it¬†[crushed the GeForce RTX 3090](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-gpu-review)¬†with many workloads. That‚Äôs not the case with the GeForce RTX 5080, but that was obviously not NVIDIA‚Äôs intention. The GB203 GPU powering the card is actually smaller than the AD103 on the RTX 4080, and it is manufactured on the same process node.\n\n>NVIDIA‚Äôs focus here was obviously on architectural advancements and AI-powered rendering. When you factor in the capabilities of RTX Neural Rendering and DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, the RTX 5080 separates itself from previous-gen offerings and offers clearly superior performance and technology. And therein lies the rub. Traditional raster will likely be less of a focus for the industry moving forward. NVIDIA is looking to the¬†[future with Blackwell](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-architecture-overview), and they're not alone, as both AMD and Intel are on this path as well . As game developers incorporate more of the technologies available in the RTX 50 series, its performance profile relative to previous-gen GPUs will change. Though 75 titles will offer support for DLSS as of tomorrow (if you factor in the DLSS override controls in the NVIDIA app), we suspect revisiting the performance of these cards in a few months may tell a different story. AMD and Intel may also have some fresh competitors in the mix too by then.\n\n>That said, most consumers buy products for what they offer today, and not what they may potentially offer in the future. If you‚Äôre considering a card in the GeForce RTX 5080 FE‚Äôs price range, it is the current best option on the market. It‚Äôs faster and has more advanced features than a GeForce RTX 4080 and also AMD‚Äôs current flagship offering. It is not a significant upgrade over the GeForce RTX 40 series for gamers though. For owners of GeForce RTX 30 series cards (or older), however, the GeForce RTX 5080 will offer a massive boost.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-im-test-geforce-rtx-4080-ti-mit-blackwell-genen/)\n\n>The RTX 5080 is particularly impressive in Ultra-HD resolutions (3840 x 2160 pixels) with activated ray tracing and patch tracing effects. Thanks to the 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 fifth-generation Tensor cores and support for DLSS 4, the card achieves exceptional frame rates in graphically demanding scenarios. While the RTX 4080 Super lags behind the RTX 5080 in most benchmarks, the new card manages to deliver a smoother frame rate and better stability through the integration of multi-frame generation (MFG). This is certainly advantageous for those who believe they need something like this.\n\n>The improved ray tracing performance, made possible by 84 fourth-generation RT cores, is particularly evident in games such as¬†*Cyberpunk 2077*¬†and¬†*Alan Wake 2*. With ray tracing enabled, the RTX 5080 also benefits from advanced ray reconstruction functionality, ensuring outstanding image quality in even the most demanding scenarios. Despite this impressive performance, some limitations can be recognized: In native 4K with maximum settings, the card may still remain at its performance limit, especially at high frame rates and intensive lighting simulations. Apart from these new features, however, the GeForce RTX 5080 remains a classic sidegrade and can hardly score with significant additional performance. Everyone has to decide for themselves whether they are disappointed by this. For my part, I had actually hoped for 20 percent.\n\n>The thermal design of the RTX 5080 is based on a double-sided flow-through cooling system that directs cool air through the card and efficiently dissipates heated air. During operation, the GPU temperature remains stable even in intensive gaming scenarios, with the card reaching a maximum temperature of just under 76 ¬∞C. The memory temperatures benefit from the optimized power supply via separate power rails, which ensure an even power supply. This minimizes thermal fluctuations and ensures that the memory area remains stable even under high loads. Thermal analysis using the Optris PI 640 shows homogeneous heat distribution, with hotspots such as the GPU and voltage converters being effectively cooled.\n\n>The noise development of the RTX 5080 is heavily dependent on the fan speed. When idling and at moderate speeds, the card remains pleasantly quiet, which is due to the low-vibration fan mounting and the aerodynamic optimization of the fan blades. Under load, however, the noise increases noticeably and reaches values of up to 38 dB(A). A characteristic humming at around 200 Hz was detected in the tests, which is caused by resonances of the fans or the voltage converters. This noise is particularly noticeable at certain fan speeds, but is not consistently audible.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-efficiency-gains-but-a-performance-letdown/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKIwmW5j6oc)\n\n>Only consider the RTX 5080 if you buy into Nvidia‚Äôs AI-fueled vision of the future\n\n>DLSS 4‚Äôs Multi Frame Generation feature must be seen (and felt) to be believed. On PCWorld‚Äôs Full Nerd podcast, we compared the leap from Single Frame to Multi Frame Generation to the leap from DLSS 1 to DLSS 2. When both technologies first came out, they showed promise but had plenty of rough edges. With DLSS 2, gamers agreed that Nvidia¬†*nailed it*. And while it‚Äôs not quite perfect, Multi Frame Generation¬†*nails it*. Once more gamers get their Dorito-stained paws on RTX 50-series cards, and are able to tool around with MFG in 75+ games and apps, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if all the furor over ‚Äúfake frames‚Äù online dies down quite a bit. It‚Äôs a literal game changer.\n\n>But Nvidia is in trouble this generation if the masses¬†*don‚Äôt*¬†embrace Multi Frame Generation. Because when it comes to traditional gaming performance, the RTX 5080 is no game changer.\n\n>It‚Äôs a pretty damned terrible generational upgrade, actually. Eking out a mere 11 to 15 more render performance than the RTX 4080 Super, at the same price, at a higher power draw, isn‚Äôt compelling whatsoever. It can‚Äôt come anywhere close to last gen‚Äôs 4090. If you don‚Äôt like AI-generated frames ‚Äî maybe you‚Äôre sensitive to latency, or you focus on competitive games, or you loathe the idea of AI frames potentially introducing visual glitches ‚Äî I‚Äôd even go so far as to suggest picking up a 4080 Super to get roughly comparable performance for less cash.\n\n>Remember: The¬†[RTX 3080 beat the RTX 2080 by¬†*60 to 80 percent*](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393472/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition-review.html)¬†when it launched earlier this decade, and it did so for just $700. Then¬†[Nvidia jacked the price of the vanilla RTX 4080](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html)¬†by¬†*$500 dollars*¬†for a 30 percent performance increase, leading to poor sales rectified only by the launch of the 4080 Super at $999. With the RTX 5080 barely outpacing that, the RTX 5080 would have been immensely more compelling at a couple hundred dollars cheaper. Two generations after the RTX 3080, Nvidia has truly devastated the xx80 tier‚Äôs value in recent memory. Upgrading from the 3080 to a 5080 will only get you about 40 to 45 percent more performance, for a price tag that‚Äôs 42 percent higher. That‚Äôs not progress.\n\n>If Nvidia didn‚Äôt have MFG in tow, this would‚Äôve been a¬†*scathing*¬†review for the RTX 5080 itself. But boyyyyy does DLSS 4‚Äôs new tricks feel great. Multi Frame Generation makes¬†*Star Wars Outlaws*, a notoriously janky game, feel just as good as¬†*Doom 2016*.¬†*Cyberpunk*‚Äôs neon Night City feels so much more¬†*alive*¬†when you‚Äôre racing around at a buttery-smooth 240Hz+, or over 150fps even with the game‚Äôs nuclear RT Overdrive Mode active.\n\n>And that‚Äôs the promise Nvidia needs gamers to buy into for the GeForce RTX 5080 ‚Äî heck, perhaps this entire RTX 50-series generation. Are you willing to embrace ‚Äúfake frames‚Äù and dip your toes into experiences that aren‚Äôt currently possible with traditional rendering alone? If so, this GPU provides enough grunt to fuel those adventures in 4K and 1440p alike.\n\n>If not, the RTX 5080 is one of the most disappointing GPU releases in a long time. It‚Äôs probably best to save your cash.\n\n>Me? I‚Äôm into the vision. But I wish Nvidia imbued the RTX 5080 with more raw rendering firepower, so it could be a decent upgrade even for ‚Äúfake frame‚Äù haters. Nvidia didn‚Äôt, alas ‚Äî so now the RTX 5080‚Äôs future hangs in the balance of those 75 DLSS 4 games working correctly at launch.\n\n>If DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation perform like a champ when that wider availability hits, it could usher in a new era of smooth, AI-supercharged performance. But if DLSS 4 winds up plagued by visual artifacts or other issues once the floodgates open, it could instead set off an explosion of ‚Äúfake frames‚Äù memes and sign a death warrant for the otherwise ho-hum RTX 5080 ‚Äî perhaps even the rest of Nvidia‚Äôs 50-series lineup.\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5090 can stand alone on its own merits, but the RTX 5080 is all-in on DLSS 4. All that‚Äôs left us to see is where the chips fall.\n\n# [LanOC](https://lanoc.org/review/video-cards/9135-nvidia-rtx-5080-founders-edition)\n\n>For performance, it will depend a lot on what your goal is for the card on whether you would say it did well in testing or not. Nvidia markets the card as a 2k or 1440p card and at that resolution and at 1080p it did extremely well, outperforming last generation's flagship RTX 4090. At 4k I would still say it did very well, but on average the RTX 4090 does edge back in ahead of it in our tests. The RTX 5080 has 16GB of memory and a smaller memory interface than the RTX 4090. It does have faster memory which makes up the difference a lot, but that does make a difference at 4k in some tests. That said, if you haven‚Äôt experienced DLSS 4 with the improved transformer models making significant improvements in the visual quality and frame generation x4 giving mind blowing performance, I would take that over the 8 extra FPS at 4k. Not only do you see a lot of those improvements even in CPU-limited situations, but you can see 300-500% performance improvements over not using DLSS at all. I didn‚Äôt run into as many of the bugs as I saw when testing the RTX 5090, but OpenCL-based workloads were still a problem but Nvidia is aware and working on it.\n\n>At the end of the day though, it always comes down to pricing. The RTX 5080 Founders Edition has an MSRP of $999. That is $200 less than the RTX 4080 launched at but is $300 more than what the RTX 3080 launched at. It‚Äôs also half of the price of the new RTX 5090. More importantly, how does it compare to other cards with current pricing? For that, I put the graph above together that takes every card I‚Äôve tested‚Äôs Time Spy Extreme GPU Score and divides it by its current price as well as its launch MSRP. For current pricing, it is the lowest available price on PCPartPicker and it is interesting to see how much pricing and card availability has changed from last week when the performance of the RTX 5090 was shown. The RTX 5080 Founders Edition is sitting in the middle of the pack for value right now but there aren‚Äôt any cards faster or even near it in performance on the chart. With all of the talk on how it compares with the RTX 4090 for example, the only 4090‚Äôs you can currently get are $2598 or more. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a value, but if you are looking for high-end 1400p or 4k performance and the RTX 5090 isn‚Äôt in your budget this is the clear choice, that is assuming you can find these anywhere near the launch price once they hit stores.\n\n# [OC3D Article](https://overclock3d.net/reviews/gpu_displays/nvidia-rtx-5080-founders-edition-review/)\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-6Dw4qsGhA)\n\n>As we said in our introduction, the Nvidia RTX 5080 Founders Edition is almost famous before it‚Äôs appeared. Such is the incredible reputation of its similarly numbered forebears, the expectation is massive. The GTX 280 was launched 17 years ago, and apart from a couple of notable missteps ‚Äì the red hot GTX 480 for example ‚Äì they‚Äôve all been stellar. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that when Nvidia introduced the RTX series of cards the top model was a RTX 2080 Ti. The name has cachet.\n\n>Clearly the RTX 5090 follows the recent trend where the 90 card is the flagship, money-no-object option. The x080 cards are for those with deep pockets, but not unlimited ones. Or perhaps those for whom gaming is your primary thing and so spending a little more is worthwhile. That‚Äôs where the Nvidia RTX 5080 Founders Edition comes in. We‚Äôve yet to see performance figures for the guaranteed massive selling RTX 5070 and RTX 5070Ti models. That leaves us with either seeing how close the Nvidia RTX 5080 can get to the big RTX 5090, or how much better than the Ada Lovelace cards it is.\n\n>If the RTX 5090 was jaw-dropping, the RTX 5080 continues that good work. The next generation of cores which festoon the tiny PCB really put the work in to give you smooth performance. We know that the big ticket item is multi-frame generation, but even in pure rasterised benchmarks the Nvidia RTX 5080 Founders Edition proves a big upgrade on the previous model. If you‚Äôre just after the latest and greatest at an enthusiast price point, you can almost stop reading here.\n\n# [PC World Article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2591060/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review.html)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZT5OuW6v0)\n\n>DLSS 4‚Äôs Multi Frame Generation feature must be seen (and felt) to be believed.

However, following¬†[our 5090 review](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-content-creation-review/), we are somewhat disappointed by the relatively small performance uplifts over the RTX 4080 SUPER. In some places, the 5090 seemed to justify the price increase over the 4090 with staggering performance increases. For the 5080, the same price seems to get you basically just the same performance in many workloads.\n\n>In¬†**video editing and motion graphics**, the RTX 5080 is about 5-10% faster than the RTX 4080 SUPER and 20-30% faster than the 3080 Ti. There were some standout areas, such as 3D performance in After Effects, with gains double those. We‚Äôre still waiting on finalized DaVinci Resolve results, but we are doubtful the 5080 will be a huge upgrade over a 4080 or 4080 SUPER, except perhaps with LongGOP media. Still, for new-to-PC users or those on even older cards, it offers a solid upgrade.\n\n>In¬†**rendering applications**, the 5080 manages better, with a 10-20% lead over the 4080 SUPER and a 55% to 188% lead over the 3080 Ti. This is definitely a performance jump that may be worth upgrading for even from the 40-series card, and it offers a great value for those using older generation cards. However, there is still the lingering issue of compatibility and performance quirks, so we would recommend buying with caution or holding off for a bit before committing to a 5080 for a rendering system. We are currently¬†[maintaining a list of known issues](https://www.pugetsystems.com/blog/2025/01/27/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-known-software-issues/)¬†in content creation applications that you can check in on to see when these are resolved.\n\n>NVIDIA‚Äôs new GeForce RTX 5080 is a great workhorse GPU that provides solid performance across the board and can handle most of the tasks you throw at it. In many workflows, it is only slightly slower than the RTX 5090, so it may end up being one of the better price-to-performance cards of this generation. If you are on a 30-series card or older, it offers a great upgrade, but less so for users on a 40-series card. Especially given the dwindling supply of those previous-generation cards, we expect the RTX 5080 to be an incredibly popular GPU.\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition/)\n\n>At 4K resolution, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 14% performance uplift over the RTX 4080 Super, 15% over the RTX 4080 non-Super. This is definitely MUCH less than expected and not nearly as much as what we saw last week from RTX 5090, which beat the RTX 4090 by 35%. Compared to the GeForce RTX 3080, the performance increase is 75%, which means NVIDIA missed the \"twice the performance every second generation\" rule. Last-generation's flagship, the RTX 4090 is 13% faster than the RTX 5080 and the new RTX 5090 flagship is 52% faster, but twice as expensive.\n\n>GeForce RTX 5080 is still faster than AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, Team Red's best GPU, by 15% in a pure raster scenario, much more in RT. AMD has confirmed that they are not going for high-end with RDNA 4, and it's expected that the RX 9070 Series will end up somewhere between RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 GRE. This means that AMD's new cards don't pose a threat to the RTX 5080, which might explain why we're not getting bigger performance improvements.\n\n>RTX 5080 is a good card for 4K gaming. With RT or Path Tracing enabled, some titles require that you use DLSS Upscaling / Frame Generation. The card is also great for 1440p gaming, to feed those high-refresh-rate gaming monitors.\n\n>NVIDIA is betting on ray tracing and Blackwell comes with several hardware improvements here. Interestingly, the RTX 5080 runs only 11% faster at RT than RTX 4080 Super‚Äîremember, we got +14% in without RT. It looks like this is partly due to the game selection. The games that show the biggest gains in our non-RT test suite do not support RT. Still, compared to AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX, the difference is massive‚Äîthe RTX 5080 is 61% (!) faster than the RX 7900 XTX. On top of that, NVIDIA is introducing several new optimization techniques that game developers can adopt. The most interesting one is Neural Rendering, which is exposed through a Microsoft DirectX API (Cooperative Vectors). This ensures that the feature is universally available for all GPU vendors to implement, so game developers should be highly motivated to pick it up. AMD has confirmed that for RDNA 4 they have put in some extra love for the RT cores, so hopefully they can catch up a bit.\n\n>NVIDIA made a big marketing push to tell everyone how awesome DLSS 4 is, and they are not wrong. First of all, DLSS 4 Multi-Frame-Generation. While DLSS 3 doubled the framerates by generating a single new frame, DLSS 4 can now triple or quadruple the frame count. In our testing this worked very well and delivered the expected FPS rates. Using FG, gaming latency does NOT scale linearly with FPS, but given a base FPS of like 40 or 50, DLSS x4 works great to achieve the smoothness of over 150 FPS, with similar latency than you started out with. Image quality is good, if you know what to look for you can see some halos around the player, but that's nothing you'd notice in actual gameplay.\n\n>Want lower latency? Then turn on DLSS 4 Upscaling, which lowers the render resolution and scales up the native frame. In the past there were a lot of debates whether DLSS upscaling image quality is good enough, some people even claimed \"better than native\"‚ÄîI strongly disagree with that‚ÄîI'm one of the people who are allergic to DLSS 3 upscaling, even at \"quality.\" With Blackwell, NVIDIA is introducing a \"Transformer\" upscaling model for DLSS, which is a major improvement over the previous \"CNN\" model. I tested Transformer and I'm in love. The image quality is so good, \"Quality\" looks like native, sometimes better. There is no more flickering or low-res smeared out textures on the horizon. Thin wires are crystal clear, even at sub-4K resolution! You really have to see it for yourself to appreciate it, it's almost like magic. The best thing? DLSS Transformer is available not only on GeForce 50 series, but on all GeForce RTX cards with Tensor Cores! While it comes with a roughly 10% performance hit compared to CNN, I would never go back to CNN. While our press driver was limited to a handful of games with DLSS 4 support, NVIDIA will have around 75 games supporting it on launch, most through NVIDIA App overrides, and many more are individually tested, to ensure best results. NVIDIA is putting extra focus on ensuring that there will be no anti-cheat drama when using the overrides.\n\n>For $1000, there is no reason you should buy RTX 4080 or RTX 4080 Super now. AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX is $820, or 18% cheaper, but it's also 15% slower in raster, and 38% slower in RT. NVIDIA is also very strong in software features, the new DLSS Transformer model is a game-changer and DLSS 4 multi-frame-generation is a notable selling point, too. No way I would buy RX 7900 XTX at that price instead of RTX 5080‚Äîmaybe if AMD drops the price considerably. Also, the way AMD is handling Radeon lately makes me wonder if their discrete GPU brand will still be around in two or three years. The upcoming RDNA 4 lineup will not target the top end of the market, so unless a miracle happens, RX 9070 XT won't be able to compete with RTX 5080, maybe RTX 5070 Ti, which is coming out soon.\n\n>If you already have a high-end GeForce RTX 40 Series card, then there is no reason to upgrade. You're just missing out on multi-frame-generation, the DLSS Transformer model is supported on all older RTX cards, too. On the other hand, if you're coming from GeForce 30, then suddenly you'll get to experience frame generation, which will make a huge difference for your gaming experience.\n\n# [The FPS Review](https://www.thefpsreview.com/2025/01/29/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-video-card-review/)\n\n>GeForce RTX 5080 performance makes us go hmmm. That‚Äôs an interesting way for us to start this paragraph, but the performance of the GeForce RTX 5080 is indeed all over the place. There are some games where the generational uplift looks exciting, and then there are others that make us scratch our head. It generally gives us a feeling of ‚Äúhmmm.‚Äù\n\n>There are some good cases where the GeForce RTX 5080 is a nice uplift from the previous generation. We did see some 23%+ performance improvements, but those seemed to be outliers, more than the norm. Overall, it has somewhere between a 10%-20% performance uplift depending on the game and settings, Ray Tracing wasn‚Äôt that big. This isn‚Äôt enough to reach or match the GeForce RTX 4090 in performance. The GeForce RTX 4090 remains the performance leader in this regard. If you thought the GeForce RTX 5080 would be as fast as the GeForce RTX 4090, it isn‚Äôt.\n\n>Some of the results we have experienced make sense, after all, the raw specifications of the GeForce RTX 5080 are not that much upgraded from the GeForce RTX 4080 Super. The GeForce RTX 5080 is a GPU that is essentially a GeForce RTX 5090 cut in half, and the price reflects that as well. The GeForce RTX 5080 seems to consume about 17% more power than the GeForce RTX 4080 Super, and we get a performance increase that is close to that, some cases better, some cases worse.\n\n>Overall this means that the GeForce RTX 5080 at times follows a little too closely to the previous generation it is supposed to be supplanting. Often times we are left with a sense of a less-than-desirable gameplay experience improvement that one would expect from a new generation.\n\n>One could even call the GeForce RTX 5080 more akin to a theoretical ‚ÄòGeForce RTX 4080 Super Ti‚Äù or ‚ÄúGeForce RTX 4080 Super Super‚Äù, at least that is what it feels like. Keep in mind that the MSRP is $999, and that IS the same MSRP that the GeForce RTX 4080 Super was as well. Therefore, technically, it is a price for performance improvement, if pricing is at $999. It‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt that exciting really.\n\n>As the GeForce RTX 4080 Super‚Äôs dry up in the market and the GeForce RTX 5080‚Äôs replace it, you will be getting a better gameplay experience with the GeForce RTX 5080. At the $999 MSRP, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 Founders Edition would be a solid upgrade from¬†*prior generations*, such as GeForce RTX 3080 or GeForce RTX 2080 or even earlier.\n\n>If you are moving from an older generation prior to the RTX 40 series, the GeForce RTX 5080 will offer a good substantial upgrade path to modern features and gameplay performance at the $999 MSRP, but if you currently own a GeForce RTX 40 Series, unless you are moving from low-end to high-end, it is not going to be worth the upgrade.\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review)\n\n>Nvidia's RTX 5080 Founders Edition delivers what we were expecting, mostly. We can't help but feel that, like the RTX 5090, these first drivers made available to reviewers aren't fully tuned for the Blackwell architecture yet. In some games, performance looks quite good with reasonable generational improvements. In others, the gains don't materialize ‚Äî particularly at lower resolutions.\n\n>What is obvious is that the RTX 5080 isn't a massive leap in performance compared to its predecessor ‚Äî whether that's the 4080 Super we tested or the slightly slower RTX 4080. Nvidia's performance claims depend almost entirely on Multi Frame Generation (MFG), and that's disingenuous at best. Nvidia knows as well as anyone that a game running at 200 FPS with 4X MFG doesn't feel the same as a game rendering at 200 FPS without any form of framegen. Pretending that the resulting \"framerates\" are comparable requires serious mental gymnastics.\n\n>However, it's equally disingenuous to suggest that framegen/MFG are useless or \"fake frames.\" If you play a game running at 30‚Äì35 FPS without framegen and then try the same game running at 55‚Äì60 FPS with framegen, the latter feels better in my book. It's not anywhere close to twice as fast, but perhaps 20% faster. And if you use 4X MFG running at 105‚Äì115 FPS, that might feel another 10‚Äì20 percent faster than the 2X framegen result.\n\n>It's really just frame smoothing, but that smoothness interacts with your brain to make the game generally feel better, even if the base input sampling rate decreases slightly.\n\n>As a potential GPU purchase, if they're both priced the same, the RTX 5080 will be better than an RTX 4080 Super. That much is a given. Right now, it doesn't always win, but driver tuning should address any shortcomings. But if you already have a decent GPU, the benefits of the 5080 over the 4080 Super are pretty thin at present. If you didn't see enough in the RTX 4080 Super to entice you to upgrade in early 2024, the extra 10% performance plus new features that the 5080 offers isn't likely to change things.\n\n>If you're in the market for a $1,000 graphics card, and assuming there's enough supply to keep prices down, the RTX 5080 now sits on the podium as the second fastest GPU overall. It's half the price of the 5090, less likely to be continually sold out, and has all the other Blackwell architecture features. It's just nowhere near the potential 30% higher baseline performance we like to see with generational upgrades.\n\n>And if you're able to justify spending a grand on the RTX 5080, it's probably not that much of a stretch to double that for the clearly superior RTX 5090 that's over 50% faster on average ‚Äî at 4K. The RTX 3090 was only 15% faster than an RTX 3080 four years ago, for double the price. For the well-funded gamer / streamer / AI researcher / etc., the 5090 is the clearly superior option. Which is one more reason we expect it will be hard to come by for quite some time.\n\n# [Computerbase - German](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-test.91176/)\n\n# [HardwareLuxx - German](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65395-leistungsplus-nur-ueber-mfg-die-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-im-test.html)\n\n# [PCGH - German](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5080-Grafikkarte-281030/Tests/Release-Preis-kaufen-Benchmark-Review-vs-4080-Super-1464610/)\n\n# [Elchapuzasinformatico - Spanish](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-founders-edition-review/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n# Video Review\n\n# [Der8auer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvQwlN1sE0U)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7hDtGh0wIo)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKhoBBX2h00)\n\n# [Gamers Nexus Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nShh_j4s2YE)\n\n# [Hardware Canucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFF7lMvpV-s)\n\n# [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEu6k-MdZgc)\n\n# [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meekBr-ZB1E)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKIwmW5j6oc)\n\n# [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoE8GQnDwQQ)\n\n# [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbg7ChsjmEA)\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-6Dw4qsGhA)\n\n# [Optimum Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7k4XWg-TcA)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZT5OuW6v0)\n\n# [Techtesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azD56D4_bFM)\n\n# [Tech Yes City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NwO1qrkEds)",

      "My takeaway.\n\n\nIf you are on 4000 series, skip. Unless you really want multi frame gen.\n\n\nFor 3000 series, it is up to you.¬†It's up to 50% more frames, some improvements in frame time, and access to frame Gen.\n\nUnder the 3000 series? Much better performance, much better frame times, more features. If you were previously considering the 4000 series, this is a no brainer. Better performance at the same price.\n\nThe 5000 series is being compared to Turing. A lot of the new architecture is focused on neural rendering, but no games use it yet. Like Turing, these cards might age well in 2 years time.\n\nThe small Gen on Gen uplift is why everyone is upset. Neural rendering doesn't exist in games right now. Silver lining is that the 5000 series is the same price as last Gen.\n\n\n\nThere is so much room for a 5080 Ti or Super. The 5090 is getting something like up to 50% more frames over the 5080. Also room for more ram on a 5080 Super/Ti.",
      "NVIDIA has been trying to make people think this way for years, but this gen doesn‚Äôt sell it at all. $1200 -> $1600 made a lot more sense last gen, even if that was also BS",

      "Gonna keep my 3080 for a while longer, lets see what the next generation has in store.",
      "The 16gb vram aside (which already made it a no-buy for me), the pitiful perf increase and price tag make this a slap in the face from nvidia.\n\nI'll definitely be holding on to my 3080 for another gen it seems.",
      "I wasn't expecting much and was still disappointment",
      "basically a 4080 Ti Super with multi frame gen \n\nnot a bad card if you're going from 30 series GPUs and below or a 4060, but still a bad card generation to generation wise",

This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.\n* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it‚Äôs difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.\n* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.\n\nIf you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.\n\n**Common Questions**\n\n* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there‚Äôs no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*\n\n**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**\n\n* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*\n* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*\n* **What does the new Power Management option ‚ÄúOptimal Power‚Äù means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*\n\nRemember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.\n\n*Did you know NVIDIA has a Developer Program with 150+ free SDKs, state-of-the-art Deep Learning courses, certification, and access to expert help. Sound interesting?* [Learn more here](https://nvda.ws/3wCfH6X)*.*",

      "# 572.47 WHQL Driver Early Performance Benchmark (Ampere based)\n\n___\n\n**Greetings all**,\n\nThis is early analysis of an nvidia driver, and as such, it will be the first reference I will have to guide us in future versions. This will be something totally voluntary, so that you can be guided in some way,¬†**do not take it as something absolute because each PC configuration is a totally different world**, so I will try to make it as global as possible (referring e.g. to the configuration of a game).\n\n**Is it worth updating the driver for my current GPU?**¬†This is a recurring question from many gamers and PC users. The general rule suggests updating our GPU drivers to the latest version, as it ensures that we get the latest bug fixes, security updates, optimizations for most of the latest AAA games, and support for the newest features.\n\nHowever, it does not guarantee the best raw performance (average FPS numbers) and frametime stability (1% and 0.1% average low/integral FPS or P1 and P0.2 FPS percentile numbers). Comparative performance analyses of GPU drivers are useful because they allow us to reliably validate and estimate significant improvements or regressions in graphics performance attributable to changes in the driver version.\n\n**PC specs are:**¬†custom desktop with Windows 10 v22H2 (latest Windows Update patches applied), 64 GB DDR4-3200 RAM (2x32), SSD NVME 1 TB, Intel i7-10700k, ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3070 OC, Single HDC 4K 60 Hz monitor (no HDR or G-Sync). Factory clocks on CPU and GPU. Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling (HAGS for short) is disabled. Resizable BAR is disabled. NVCP Global Settings (default).\n\nFrame Times are recorded using¬†**PresentMon**¬†during the built-in benchmark run inside each game. Each benchmark is run initially four times, and the first result is discarded. Outliers results, with more than 5% variance in any of my used metrics from the average, are also discarded and repeated.\n\nTo the methodology, I have decided to add a Non-Synthetic Benchmarks, in this case Unigine Benchmark. When installing each driver, the only option I will not enable will be GeForce Experience.\n\n___\n\n# The Riftbreaker\n\nUsing the default settings everything in Ultra with Dx12.

      "Yeah, but seems hardly surprising given the very modest uplift that the 5080 has over the 4080/4080S. This whole generation is very disappointing if you aren't interested in frame generation, and given the same TSMC 4N fabrication process we couldn't expect much of a gain without drastic increases in power consumption.\n\nI am sure I will be happy with a 5070 Ti when I eventually get one this year, but I am upgrading from a 3060 Ti so the difference will be huge. Just annoying that we had a pretty disappointing uplift with the 40XX cards, and then an even worse uplift with the 50XX cards. Hopefully I will actually like the frame gen and not really notice the artifacting or added latency for those games I might want to max out."

Ironically the previous gen 7800X3D is $360 probably the best option since it's so close to 9800X3D, a lot cheaper, and tends to be much more power efficient.",

The ROG Astral series combines top-tier performance and a sleek, stellar new design, with both air-cooled and liquid-cooled variants ready to power your next PC. We‚Äôre also launching updated versions of our ROG Strix, TUF Gaming, and ROG Prime families, featuring the GeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, and 5070 GPUs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dk3npdakmibe1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=fddf91f0e1e732908f882f46eeba2424b0b0b9fc\n\n# ASUS GeForce RTX Series 50 Series Design Upgrades\n\nEven our graphics cards get to have New Year's resolutions sometimes, and with the launch of the GeForce RTX 50 Series we have the opportunity to make a few changes. To start with, we're upgrading our thermal paste to a completely different thermal pad technology. Additionally, we're adding new design and finishing elements to improve the reliability and stability of our GeForce RTX 50 Series cards. Lastly, while ROG Astral cards and GPU Tweak III have some new toys, we have a new application called MuseTree that anyone with an ASUS GeForce RTX 40 Series or 50 Series graphics card can use for local AI-powered image generation.\n\n**It's Not Just A Phase -** \n\nTo start with, every ASUS GeForce 50 Series cards will use phase-change thermal pad technology, which optimizes heat transfer and boosts hardware longevity so that you can push your GPU to its limits. \n\nWhy the change? The electrically non-conductive pad is a solid at room temperature but liquifies as it heats up. As it melts, it fills the microscopic gaps between the GPU and thermal module, providing superior thermal conductivity and enhanced heat dissipation, ensuring optimal performance, even for sustained, heavy GPU workloads.¬†¬†\n\nAdditionally, the phase-change thermal pads offer exceptional longevity. They outlast traditional pastes by a significant margin, even for graphics cards that see heavy workloads on a regular basis.\n\n**ASUS GPU Guard & Bracket -** ASUS GPU Guard applies adhesive to secure all four corners to reduce the risk of cracks, while a GPU bracket helps ensure uniform mounting pressure and extra stability.\n\n**MaxContact Design -** MaxContact is a special ASUS manufacturing process that effectively expands the surface area of the heat spreader that sits atop the GPU by 5%, compared to traditional designs. This improves temperatures by up to 2¬∞C, in concert with an extensive heatsink array and powerful¬†Axial-tech fans.\n\n**Protective PCB Coating\\* -** A protective conformal coating envelops the circuit board to help protect against short-circuits caused by moisture, dust or debris.\n\n\\*Available on ROG Astral, ROG Strix, and TUF Gaming cards\n\n**GPU Tweak III and ROG Astral cards -** GPU Tweak III includes many of the features that are already available to other graphics cards, such as the ability to effortlessly fine-tune overclocking settings, but now offers significant options for owners of ROG Astral Cards. We'll cover this more below.\n\n**MuseTree AI-powered Image Generation App -** ASUS GeForce RTX 40 and 50 Series owners can download a free application for local AI image-generation. All AI processing is done on your ASUS graphics card, it doesn't require complex prompts, and not only is the app free but there's no subscription or prompt fees.

      "Yeah so the 5070ti is functionally identical to the 7900xtx in raster. Lots of people were saying the 7900xtx was much faster, but 3% is margin of error that can swing either direction depending on game selection.",
      "Yo, this took a lot of time to compile. Appreciate it man. \n\nIt's the least worst of all the cards released so far. It's 11-14% faster than a 4070TiS depending on the res. It's also 6% cheaper than the 4070TiS. Put the two together, and it's about 20% better for the same price. Which is the bare minimum for gen-on-gen in my completely arbitrary opinion.\n\nEdit: this is presuming you somehow nabbed a MSRP card. The real price seems to be $900.",

      "People would cherrypick the data they want.",
      "Can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúthe XTX is way faster than the 4080 Super in raster‚Äù. These people don‚Äôt live in reality.",

      "I've had one yesterday tell me that 7900XTX is plain 20% faster because in one (out of whole 5) games tested by GN at 1440p XTX was like 17% faster. Disregarding than in the rest of those it was at best 10% faster and in any wider benchmark it never broke even 10% properly.",
      "And the moment you turn on DLSS/RT then that margin gets trampled.\n\nOnly thing holding back the 5070ti now is the low stock price",
      "Man, I thought the 4070 struggling to consistently match the 3080 was sad, but now the freaking *70 Ti* card flat out loses to the previous gen 80 card? Can't even punch *half a tier* up?\n\nI guess once (if?) they come back down to MSRP that will make them good enough value... but you can also look at it as: 5 years after the 3080, you get slightly less than 4080 performance for slightly more than 3080 MSRP. If 40 series killed performance per dollar advancement then 50 series is dancing on its grave",
      "To be fair, even used 4070 ti super cards are going for much higher than its msrp on places like ebay.",
      "Very comprehensive comparison",
      "Have any reviewers found that their cards have the ROP issue?",
      "Some people live to cherry pick data because that confirms their beliefs. Maybe they are destined to be cherry farmers! \n\nThat's why i always appreciate what this OP is doing on his website because these sort of aggregation of many reviews is the only way we can get the big picture.",
      "Not really, when it's not cheaper than the 4070ti super, but ok, maybe some models are in the US.\nEssentially it's a relaunch of the 4080/4080 super. Same price, same performance.",
      "I think someone should do a gen-to-gen performance comparison between Nvidia's various generations, on a per tier, apple-to-apples basis. Because I think an 11-14% uplift from a whole 2 year generational gap is probably not that great. Yeah it's technically a better deal than the previous gen, but not really.",
      "Yeah, definitely not a 1:1 comparison when the 50 series doesn't really sell at MSRP with most vendors. Still an interesting comparison though nonetheless.",
      "people also showed 5070ti overclocks very well just like the 5080.",
      "And it *should* hit MSRP eventually. Even the 3070 and 4070 did after a while.\n\n(And, of course, pretty much every gen before that, MSRP was just a higher price to make the always-lower street price seem like a better deal, like it is for every other kind of product. That was normal, and should be again, if competition ever starts being a thing again in the GPU space. All eyes on you intel).",

Maybe it boosted a few things specifically, potentially Steel Nomad being one of them (didn't realize it was free till after I updated the driver, and I'm not rolling back to test it specifically), but this definitely isn't some across the board magic bullet. \n\nDriver itself seems to be working as well as the previous (which was fine for me tbh), so that's good I guess.",
      "No that's wrong. You can use DLSS4 with 566 and probably with all drivers. Just use DLSS Swapper or the Nvidia profile inspector dlss override setting. Set preset with inspector, k or j for transformer model.",
      "Testing a single workload is an easy way to get inaccurate results.\n\nIt's a 7.72% increase in Steel Nomad, but there's no guarantee that you'll see a similar performance uplift in other workloads.   \nGame A can have a even bigger uplift, while Game B sees a performance decrease, Game C keeps the same performance, Productivity Workload D loses performance, Productivity Workload E suffers from crashes, and so on.\n\nIf you want accurate results, it's advisable to have a diversified testing suite, and run each workload multiple times."

Anyway i decided to test it. For me personally that input delay is rarely noticable. On the other side u get that smooth experience when u reach +200 FPS and sharp 4K image.\n\nMy card is OC. Core cloak goes between 3100 and 3150 ghz depending on game. Power draw: 360watts. \n\nGaming results. Gonna list few games.\n\nCyberpunk 2077:\nEverything maxed out including Ray Tracing on Ultra (PT OFF) DLSS/Q + MFG x3 over 120 FPS in Dogtown during combat/driving.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle:\nEverything maxed out including RT with DLSS/P above 60 FPS. Only in tutorial and Sukhotai area  FPS drops below 60. If u disable PT and go native u are well over 100 FPS so u do not really need DLSS or MFG.\n\nMarvel Rivals\nEverything maxed out including Lumeni GI with DLSS/Q MFGx4 over 240 FPS. \n\nDelta Force\nExtreme settings with DLSS/Q and MFG x3 over 200 FPS.\n\n40K Darktide\nEverything maxed out with DLSS/Q and MFGx4 over 200 FPS\n\n40K Space Marine 2 \nUltra settings with DLSS/Q and FG over 150 FPS.\n\nAnd so on. I played/tested alot of old/new games and i'm really impressed.\n\nI want to point out that i did upgrade from 7900 XT while keeping my old 5800x3d. At first i thought that since i was gaming at 4K i should avoid getting new CPU. But i was really wrong.\n\nNot just bottleneck but everything from framerate and 1% was just bad. I was crazy enough to re test all games that i played with 5800x3d and 5080 just to see the difference. It is insane how much better 9800x3d is. If u want to buy RTX 5000 GPUs and you plan to use old DDR4 platform you will miss out and leave alot of performance.\n\nAll in all if u plan to game on 4K either 5070 Ti or 5080 will get the job done fairly easy.\n\nJust get 7800x3d or 9800x3d or 9700x/7700. I can't stress enough how much performance u leave on table if u pair it with DDR4 platform.\n\nOne downside tho 16GB VRAM. \n\nWith MFG/RT most of the newer titles are always around 13-15GB of VRAM usage.\n\nSome games like Indiana Jones,Space Marine 2,RE4 remake can reach 15/16GB usage and so on. That will probably be issue in long run but we will see.\n\n",

      "Yes. For example in Indiana Jones when u enter Vatican City on 5800x3d GPU usage would drop as low as 70% and 40 FPS but with 9800x3d 65-70 and GPU usage is fixed 99%. That is what flat 25 FPS differenxe not counting 1% lows.\n\nSpace Marine 2 with 5800x3d is not great. Stutters all over the place and GPU usage dropping all the time as low as 60-70% depnding on area. With 9800x3d everything is so smooth. \n\nHogwarts Legacy also big difference. I could get over 100+ FPS 4k Native on high. With 5800x3d each time when u enter Hogsmeade for example GPU usage goes dowm to smth like 50-60%.\n\nDifference is massive. People are not aware how big it is actually.",
      "Shit optimization vs brute force performance.",
      "My question is are you testing for usage or allocation. \n\nMost people assume if the game allocates xyz amounts of ram its using it. That isn't always the case and my understanding is testing for allocation vs usage is not easy.",
      "Must be a driver bug or something because I did not have that issue with a 5700X3D and a 4080 Super in Indiana Jones in Vatican city",
      "Probably get shit for this, but I upgraded from a 4080 to a 5080 ASUS tuf gaming OC today. Overclocked it's getting around 2975-3000mhz. +2000 on mem (17001)\n\n7950x3d 64gb ddr5\n\nI went from getting 70-80 fps in Oblivion remastered (with software lumen) to 115-125 fps with hardware turned on. Add in FG x3 200+ fps. Shit is ridiculous. Latency is 30-35ms.\n\nCard was/is stupid expensive, but it was worth it for me. I can only imagine a fucking 5090 lmao\n\nEdit: Should add I also got Doom The Dark ages with the card lol",
      "Im just sitting on the fence for the 5080 24gb,,, will probably cost as much as current 5080s too. That 16gb ram buffer was an absolute joke barely seperates itself from the 5070ti",
      "Sell the 3080 while it's still worth something, the 10GB vram will make its value tank, way quicker than it would otherwise have.",
      "16 is fine for now. In a couple years I‚Äôll definitely target higher vram I‚Äôm sure tho",
      "It‚Äôs pretty huge depending on the game I only have one data point, but I gained about 30fps when I upgraded from a 5800x3d to a 9800x3d running at 4k max settings on helldivers 2 with a 5090. Helldivers is a CPU intensive game so that is part of the reason but it def holds true. I noticed a big difference in cyberpunk as well but I didn‚Äôt play enough before I switched to know for sure what the frame difference was.",
      "Yeah that is why i said i have 240hz. In Ravels i can get good frame rate without MFG but when u cap it to 240hz that feeling is just awesome. Fluid and smooth as butter. MFG is not that great if u do not use high refresh rate screen tho.",
      "Because he'd miss things without realising",
      "Can concur.  I love my 5080FE paired with a 9950X3D.  64GB of Corsair Dominator Titanium 6000mhz CL30 DDR5 and my system screams in games.",
      "4090 is better card. I woudn't do that personally.",
      "Oo okay. i also run 4k but with with a 5700x3d and a 5090. No 1% low issues for me runs high fps. thx for the insight nonetheless",
      "Indeed something else is going on. Og poster is gpu bound at 4K so it doesn‚Äôt make much sense. There are minimal performance gains to be had at that resolution. That‚Äôs why all benchmarks for cpus are tested at 1080p."

AMD was supposed to have a massive supply this generation, wonder where those went?\n\nCould also just be a detection error for AMD GPUs, with the new cards being lumped into the generic \"AMD Radeon Graphics\" category.",
      "Yep. \n\nDespite knowing that, seeing such statistics is always kind of sobering.\n\nWhen on Reddit, it's easy to think everyone and their mom's dog gets either a 5090 or has a 4090. :'D",

      "Dang maybe nvidia wasn't lying about this being their most successful launch and selling more than 2x the amount during the 40 series launch.\n\nAnd the reason gpus are so hard to find isn't stock but demand.\n\n In the us I think stock is a bigger issue than other places tho due to companies limiting imports due to the tariff uncertainties tho.",

Some of them even claimed that the 9070 XT sold more than 200,000 units on launch day, while others were saying that the 9070 outsold the entire 50 series lineup.\n\nSo, we all think that the 50 series was the worst launch ever by Nvidia but that‚Äôs not true.\n\nYeah, I kind of agree that the 5090s were initially out of stock, but their mid-range GPUs were readily available at launch.",

I have a kick-ass 1080p monitor from MSI. I don't have a desire to upgrade because I'm poor as hell and while I could afford a 1440/2160p monitor, I certainly can't afford the video card to utilize it. I was running a 660 ti until November when I finally pulled the trigger on a used 4060 ti. It was much more than I wanted to spend but I needed to upgrade badly. \n\nMy friends decision to play at 1080p is also financial. I do have a 4k television though.",
      "They don't really want to buy AMD they just want AMD to make Nvidia cards cheaper",
      "In the future I believe there'll be a lot more 5070Tis as it is the best card for buyers in the whole lineup, it gives you solid 4k performance while also not breaking your bank",
      "I can't wait for /r/AMD to blacklist yet another steam hardware survey report over some perceived conspiracy that Nvidia pays off Valve to block AMD users from getting polled. \n\n\"Steam survey is worthless\" is a frequently repeated phrase over there.",
      "I've been downvoted to hell for this but the 5070 is unironically the best launch this year.  It's consistently available at or below MSRP and at 30% lower price than the 5070Ti (for \\~ 25% less performance) it's a no brainer for most gamers.\n\n  \nOf course Reddit will convince you that you need a $3k GPU to be considered good though.",
      "I don‚Äôt think you need a 5090 to be considered ‚Äúgood,‚Äù or even that the 5070 is a bad card, however my hesitations with it is the amount of vram. It‚Äôs definitely a powerful enough card that it could benefit from more vram. While 12GB may not be a problem for some folks today, it very well may not be enough for those same folks in a year or two with newer titles coming out. IMO, a $500+ gaming graphics card in 2025, that many people are paying over $600 for, should have more vram.",
      "Over on /r/AMD I had seen some posts around launch claiming Radeon sold over 500,000 cards during its launch window, and supposedly outsold the entirety of Nvidia's 50 series. It's quickly becoming apparent those numbers were just flat out fake."

      "So is the 5070ti just a 4080 without PhysX?",
      "Not quite sure I believe this statement, but in any case.\n\nIsn't this quite irrelevant? What happens when you OC the 7900XTX... Do you overclock the 5070 ti again? Are you going to have an overclock review loop till there is a nuclear meltdown? \n\nPoint is. If you're gonna compare overclocked cards. Shouldn't you compare them against other cards their overclock results?",
      "how? the website has the 7900xtx beating it in almost every test. clickbaited. ouch",

      "It's tied with a 4080. I can't find a single semi-recent generation where the 70ti wasn't significantly better than the previous 80. Heck, the 20 series was considered bad and didn't even have a 70ti, but the 2070 was significantly better than the 1080.\n\nThe only universe where this is \"pretty good\" is one where you expect absolute stagnation."

Its for people who own older cards wondering why they are paying so much more for something that's hardly better than what was offered 2 years ago.\n\nBTW there is no FE card this time around, and *most* of the cards at microcenter are priced at what a 4080 super was going for MSRP.\n\nThere are people asking themselves if they should pay 4080 super prices to upgrade their 1060 to a 5070ti. More money for something that isn't even faster.",

Even as someone who loves ray tracing and would be curious to try frame gen for myself, I'd never pay $600+ for them if they were hypothetically sold as a standalone software plug-ins instead.

Quite the opposite, really. That's because it wouldn't get them any views by doing so.\n\nThat's why it's important to get the raw data and make an informed and pragmatic conclusion without the nonsense.",

But the reviews seem to be far more focused on those issues today than the actual product. It's just tiring. \n\nThe situation is crazy but there's only so many of these things that can be made, and AI is taking capacity. The only way to fix this is with more chip production and that's not cheap or easy.",
      "Yeah, but what are gamers actually getting from these increasingly complex chips when the generational performance uplift is so pitiful? The 5090 offers a decent uplift over the 4090 if you ignore the insane, needless melting hazard, but the rest of the 50 series is offering less of a gain than some mid-generation upgrades for the Super or Ti models. It's legitimately embarrassing to see the 5070 Ti still getting outdone by the 4080, or even 4070 Ti Super in some cases, especially given the price increase.\n\nI'm fine with big prices if it means big performance, but the 50 series represents nothing of the sort unless you're exclusively powering AI. DLSS and Frame Gen are amazing technologies that can be used in lieu of significant hardware improvements, but fundamentally they are band-aids, not long-term solutions, and people shouldn't be expected to pay that much for what amounts to a temporary shortcut.",
      "Dealing with MSRPs is one of the hardest things to do in reviews. Usually they're way too high and make no sense at all, but then they drop to competitive levels (SSDs are a great example). And now we have something that makes a lot of sense at MSRP but we need to wait for stock and prices to settle. MSRPs are not that useful, but you can't completely ignore them either.\n\nI'd just like you to you have as much data as possible so you can make an informed decision based on whatever the actual price is. In case of new GPUs: if you can get one at MSRP or a premium that you're happy with, perfect. If the price is terrible, don't buy it! If everyone stops buying the products at prices they disagree with, prices will come down.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the nice words and the motivation to keep working on more cards today :P  u/ThatTallCarpenter u/damastaGR (and u/aiiqa too :) )",

      "Barely 15% faster than a 4060Ti isn't \"decent\", it's simply substandard.\n\nDepending on who you ask 20% would be decent and 25% good especially when you consider that its MSRP (at least on paper) is $70 lower than the previous gen.",
      "if it was 100 less it'd be a good card lol",
      "It's all about price, it seems like an average card but the 8gb one is ridiculous at the price point, just needs to be removed from the stack at this point and offer 12gb + across the board (more ideally 16gb) for this price region.\n\n\nMSRP is worthless these days as well sadly so reviewing is difficult as the context is changing, saying a card is good or bad typically hinges on where it is priced against the competition.",
      "Reddit told me it's the worst card of all time",
      "2060 Super was between 1070Ti and 1080.  \n3060Ti was roughly equivalent to 2080 or 2080 Super.  \n5060Ti is very far from 4080 or even 4070Ti. It's worse than a 4070.",
      "About a year ago people were telling us we were wrong about 8GB being too little VRAM. So now reviewers finally agree that 8GB is too low and they suggest a 12GB card. How long will that last?",
      "> and they suggest a 12GB card\n\nThe very same card which nVidia crippled on purpose, because they knew it offered the best price/perf ratio üòí",
      "Not the worst, but it‚Äôs still pretty underwhelming. They say it‚Äôs a decent uplift of about 15-20% from the previous gen, but you‚Äôre comparing it to the wet noodle that was the 4060ti, which couldn‚Äôt decide if it was a 10% uplift over the 3060ti or slightly behind it when it‚Äôs crippled bandwidth started making an impact on performance. It‚Äôs even more amusing realizing the 3080, a 4 year old card mind you, is still beating the 5060ti in rasterized performance. \n\nPoint is, people are a bit excited at the fact it has 16gb of vram and isn‚Äôt gonna cost another $100 more than the 8gb model, but that‚Äôs still a big *if*, considering there is no FE model for AIBs to base the price around.",
      "I think reviewers gotta realize that not everyone wants to or has the money to spend up. So instead they spend down and accept their fate.",
      "What was the historical uplift? Say 1060 to 2060 to 3060?",
      "Everything about this lineup is geared toward upselling you.\n\n* 5060 8GB: Unimpressive entry level card, just exists to grab low info buyers\n* 5060 Ti 8GB: Complete non-starter, shouldn‚Äôt exist.\n* 5060 Ti 16GB: Fine, poor value compared to the marginally more expensive 5070.\n* 5070: Decent performance for price but VRAM limited, will be obsolete soon.\n* 5070 Ti: The first actual desirable option\n* 5080: The ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù pick\n\nBasically you‚Äôre making major, arguably unacceptable, compromises all the way up until $750. It‚Äôs the most blatant example I‚Äôve seen of stair-stepping consumers into spending more money.",
      "Hopefully by this point next year more people will realize that 12GB for any card above $500 is also a scam.",
      "Literally just reviewing the card. You can make up your own mind, right?\n\nOr do the reviewers really have to act like outrage merchants for you to not be upset with their content?",
      "Man, the 3060ti was crazy good value if not for the ridiculous 8GB of vram.\n\n\nI would not have upgraded to a 5070 if it was not the case.",
      "Depends what time period you include historically.  20 years ago, generation to generation jumps were much bigger.  Partly because they were starting out with much more constrained designs that were easier to improve on, and partly because the fabrication was doing better with scaling from generation to generation.  But no matter how you approach the data, this is a small jump.  Historically, it probably would have been called a small die shrink and this would have been the \"X50\" -> \"X50, Upgraded Edition\" rather than the \"Y50.\"  It's really only being marketing as a whole new generation of the product line because the marketing department figures we are due for a new generation.\n\nThe 1600 series and RTX2000 launched on 12nm (at TSMC).\n\nRTX 3000 was 8nm (but manufactured at Samsung, so not directly comparable)\n\nRTX 4000 was 4nm (Back to TSMC)\n\nRTX 5000 is on a slightly different/newer process node at TSMC but still advertised at \"4nm.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nvidia_graphics_processing_units#RTX_50_series\n\nSo they underlying manufacturing technology hasn't had a generational jump this time.  That limits how much new stuff NV can pack into the design.  They get a few percent from improved design, and a few percent from refinements in the manufacturing process.  But in ye Oelden days of advanced CPU/GPU product lines, something advertised as a whole new generation of the product line would typically happen when manufacturing tech could cram about 2x as many parts onto a chip, so you would expect to get >2x the performance generation to generation rather than like 20%.  Since modern manufacturing is already counting individual atoms in numbers you could keep track of on your fingers when laying down layers of material, there's a lot less \"low hanging fruit\" to improve on these days.  Whatever they release as the \"RTX 6000 series\" will probably be the sort of improvement over the 4000 series that folks were hoping for, with all the manufacturing process improvements that weren't ready for this product cycle.",
      "Honest question, do people still expect like 30-40% uplift every generation? The chip hasn't changed much at all from 40 to 50 series. Besides, most people don't upgrade gen to gen, so even the it's 15-20% better doesn't matter because people are comparing from multiple gens back sometimes.",
      "For Reddit any NVIDIA card is the worst of all time.",
      "I believe the 8gb versions (they‚Äôre releasing a NON-ti 5060 eventually? what is this, a graphics card for ants?) exist for 3 reasons:\n\n1. Price anchoring for the 16gb version. Although it‚Äôs only an additional +13% in price, so that‚Äôs pretty questionable. ¬†¬†\n\n2. Provide an entry level, 16gb card, that people can afford, in lieu of scalped **70+ SKU models. ¬†¬†\n\n3. Compete with Intel / AMD entries, simply to recapture market share. People climb the ladder over time, so 5060 buyers are (a) not buying competitor products and (b) going to spend more future money with Nvidia.\n\nAs a 3060 12gb owner I‚Äôve felt lucky for years given the 12gb and performance. I thought the 5060ti 16gb would be a significant upgrade, but they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs only 15% on average, 30% in **some** games. Ugh.",
      "It feels like pricing and naming/positioning, is what many criticism boils down in reality. Not just for this card but some others. If some of these cards didn't have its name/position and the price to match that name/position, they might be much better regarded.",
      ">they knew it offered the best price/perf ratio\n\nThis metric is not used in NV headquarters."

I will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links. This will be sorted alphabetically.\n\n# Written Articles\n\n# [Babeltechreviews](https://babeltechreviews.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-asus-prime-edition/)\n\n>The Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti is a well-balanced GPU that delivers strong performance, particularly at¬†**1440p and high-refresh 1080p gaming**. Its¬†**efficient design, improved cooling, and significant performance gains**¬†over the RTX 3070 and 4070 make it a compelling upgrade for gamers still on older-generation cards.¬†**DLSS 4 support**¬†further enhances its longevity, allowing for improved frame rates in demanding titles, making it a forward-thinking choice for those planning to keep their system for years to come.\n\n>However,¬†pricing and availability are the biggest concerns surrounding the RTX 5070 Ti. While Nvidia has set an MSRP of $749, market conditions, tariffs, and limited stock often push the actual retail price higher. With early reports indicating that some models will land closer to¬†$899 or more, the value proposition erodes. There are cards at launch at the MSRP of $749.99 and if you can snag one, we would recommend it. At the higher price points, an RTX 4080‚Äîespecially if discounted or available second-hand‚Äîbecomes a better buy due to its¬†**higher VRAM capacity, better raw performance, and increased longevity for 4K gaming**. The only other factor would be how important DLSS 4 is for you.\n\n>Gamers should truly evaluate their¬†**needs, budget, and resolution targets**¬†before deciding, as AMD‚Äôs offerings could provide¬†**better price-to-performance in pure rasterized gaming scenarios**. It goes without saying that the inflated pricing right now should be a huge stopping point for many; if you can wait, it would be best to look for a card near MSRP and not pay the scalper pricing.\n\n>Ultimately, the RTX 5070 Ti is¬†**a fantastic card, but only if it remains at or near MSRP**. If prices¬†**creep toward $900**, it loses appeal, especially when AMD‚Äôs alternatives and Nvidia‚Äôs own¬†**RTX 4080-class GPUs**¬†offer¬†**better raw performance per dollar**. Gamers should watch for sales, check AMD‚Äôs competitive pricing, and weigh whether DLSS 4 and ray tracing enhancements justify the cost over alternative GPUs.\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlWmYg7Vr3Q&pp=ygUPZGlnaXRhbCBmb3VuZHJ5)\n\n>With our testing complete, the RTX 5070 Ti does enough to earn a recommendation. In short, you're getting a 16 percent improvement over the RTX 4070 Ti for $50 less - in theory - or a more measly seven percent advantage over the 4070 Ti Super. Add on frame generation and a few other niceties like DisplayPort 2.1, and the value proposition has at least improved over the last-gen card... though it's clear that the revised design and GDDR7 don't account for anywhere near the sort of gen-on-gen boost you get from a more substantial change, such as a shift to a new process process node.\n\n>In terms of our table of overall performance from 17 games tested, it's no surprise to see the 5090, 4090 and 5080 at the top across all resolutions. There's not much to divide the 4080 Super, 4080 and 5070 Ti too, with the outgoing 4070 Ti Super being no slouch either. It's interesting to note that even at 1080p, the close grouping of products around the 5070 Ti remains in place - it's only really the 4090 and 5090 that lose ground.\n\n>In common with RTX 5080, we're looking at another upwards bump in pure performance terms, though this time the gap between the new card and its older counterpart is much tighter, so who would I recommend this product to? Well, depending on resolution, you're looking at anything from a 31 to 33 percent general uplift in performance against the classic RTX 3080. Combined with the extra memory and the features of DLSS 4, I'd consider that the kind of threshold that's worth an upgrade, especially as you'll be able to more easily migrate into the full RT path tracing experience on a number of games which will prove more challenging on 3080-class hardware.\n\n>In terms of recommendations, the same applies if you have any of the higher end RDNA 2 cards, like 6800 XT, for example. Similarly, if you're still on a Turing-class 20 series card, you'll see a gigantic improvement here from the likes of 2080, 2070 Super and even 2080 Ti.\n\n>The question is, of course, whether the value calculations we've made are actually applicable. Nvidia sent over a list of cards promised to be at MSRP in the US and UK - which we've duly reproduced on our \"[where to buy RTX 5070 Ti](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-where-to-buy-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-uk-us-links)\" page - but we won't know until launch day how accessible they'll be.\n\n# [eTeknix Article](https://www.eteknix.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-graphics-card-review/)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2dqGTJ_Hj4)\n\n>First and foremost, the RTX 5070 Ti is a big step up for those still on an RTX 3070 Ti, in some cases offering a massive 60‚Äì70% performance uplift in rasterisation and over 100% in ray tracing, making it one of the most substantial generational jumps we‚Äôve seen for this class of GPU. More importantly, it doubles the VRAM to 16GB of GDDR7 on a 256-bit bus, solving one of the biggest complaints about the 3070 Ti‚Äôs limited 8GB frame buffer, which has clearly started to show its age in modern titles.\n\n>Compared to the RTX 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti SUPER, the 5070 Ti still brings noticeable improvements, but the margins aren‚Äôt as dramatic. With around 17% uplifts over the 4070 Ti and around 9% over the 4070 Ti SUPER, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily make those cards obsolete, but it does offer a meaningful performance-per-pound advantage‚Äîespecially if you skipped the 40 series and are looking for the best bang for your buck in the 70-class segment. Though, as mentioned, pricing is a bit out of whack anyway, and that‚Äôs a sore subject.\n\n>The pricing should have made the 5070 Ti a killer option, and at the announced MSRP of ¬£749, this GPU easily justifies itself, slotting in close to the 4080 series in performance while staying significantly cheaper. It also comes with NVIDIA‚Äôs latest technologies like DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation (MFG), which dramatically improves performance and, along with Reflex, reduces latency, but only in supported titles. Though you could argue that‚Äôs better than what the competition are doing right now by turning unplayable frame rates at 4K with ray tracing into something smooth and responsive, all while maintaining lower latency than native rendering.\n\n>Now, the big problem is that MSRP pricing never lasts, and NVIDIA‚Äôs recent track record with the 5080 and 5090 tells us that the 5070 Ti is unlikely to be found at ¬£749 for long, if at all. We‚Äôve already seen retailers listing it at ¬£899, which puts it in a very different competitive position. If it lands closer to ¬£899‚Äì¬£999, suddenly the 4080 series and AMD‚Äôs 9000 series cards become much more attractive alternatives. But even then, I, like many others, am frustrated. It seems long gone are the days where a 70 Ti class would cost you ¬£599 like the 3070 Ti, and you‚Äôd get it for that price. That really is the frustrating part, as the 5070 Ti is a great GPU. It has strong generational performance if you‚Äôre willing to skip a generation, excellent ray tracing, if you‚Äôre willing to skip a generation, and better upscaling capabilities, but if NVIDIA adds DLSS 4 to the 40 series, then again, if you skip a generation.\n\n>Overall, its value depends entirely on real-world pricing. If it stays close to MSRP, it‚Äôs a good, solid upgrade for those moving from the 3070 Ti or even a 4070 Ti user looking for extra power without stepping into flagship pricing and wanting to harness the latest tech. But if inflated pricing and scalping take hold, it loses its edge, making it a tougher sell in an already crowded GPU market. And with AMD‚Äôs 9000 series on the horizon, NVIDIA and their partners, through both AIBs and retail, may need to do some rethinking.\n\n>For now, the RTX 5070 Ti delivers on its promise of being a strong next-gen option, and if you can get it at MSRP, it‚Äôs a solid buy. But as we‚Äôve seen before, that‚Äôs a big ‚Äúif‚Äù, and it‚Äôs something we‚Äôll be watching closely in the coming weeks. Let me know what you think in the comments section below. Will you be upgrading from the 30 series? Are you already on a 40 series GPU and are looking to upgrade, but now maybe don‚Äôt see the point? Your feedback would be good to see.\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-16g-ventus-3x-oc-review/)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti arrives as the third release in NVIDIA‚Äôs RTX 5000 series, highlighting a blend of raw raster horsepower and AI-augmented features like DLSS4 and Multi Frame Generation (MFG). Many gamers stay cautious about these AI-driven additions, preferring straightforward rasterization for a more accurate picture. This scepticism is understandable since the older RTX 4000 series, already equipped with DLSS 3.5, delivers solid frame rates and remains competitive. As NVIDIA moves deeper into the mid-range of the 5000 lineup, the performance gap compared to the previous generation narrows, making some wonder if an upgrade is worthwhile if they mainly value traditional rendering.¬†NVIDIA continues to emphasize AI acceleration, a trend we mentioned with the RTX 5090 release. While this approach feels visionary, a sizeable portion of the gaming community believes it‚Äôs advancing faster than the market can fully embrace. Still, the RTX 5000 cards offer notable gains in Ray Tracing and the new Neural Shading feature, both of which boost lighting realism and render scenes at higher resolutions. In games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2, Ray Tracing combined with DLSS4/MFG can drive frame rates to impressive levels. However, that performance can demand a lot of power and efficient cooling. Like its siblings, the RTX 5070 Ti needs a robust power supply and good case airflow. There‚Äôs also potential for manual tuning and overclocking, which might add around five percent more performance‚Äîthough silicon quality and thermals can limit those gains.¬†In raw power terms, the RTX 5070 Ti brings a modest boost alongside higher energy demands and a heftier price tag. For players who simply want traditional frame rates without AI enhancements, it might not feel like a huge leap over a premium 4000 series card. On the horizon, AMD has something new planned as well, leaving many to wonder how that will stack up. For now, the 4000 series remains a solid option, especially with DLSS 3.5 in its corner. NVIDIA‚Äôs challenge lies in convincing enthusiasts that AI-boosted frames don‚Äôt sacrifice image quality or add unwanted latency.¬†MSI steps in with its Ventus version of the RTX 5070 Ti, featuring a reinforced support bracket for added stability and a 12V-2√ó6 adapter cable for power. The Ventus 3X cooler generally keeps noise(reasonably) in check, though actual temperatures vary per build. These partner cards rarely stray far from reference specs but can draw attention from buyers who prefer a specific brand or design. As for the rumored 749-dollar price tag, it‚Äôs unclear if that will hold once it hits store shelves, but MSI seems to have delivered a solid offering at that MSRP. In the end, upgrading from a 4070 Ti may not be necessary for most users. Those moving up from the RTX 3000 series or older, however, might find enough reasons to make the jump\n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/asus-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-prime-review)\n\n>At this point, we suspect all of your understand NVIDIA‚Äôs M.O. with the GeForce RTX 50 series. Traditional rasterization performance was increased over the previous generation, but not to the same extent as past releases. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti leapfrogged the RTX 3070 Ti with traditional raster, whereas the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is about +/-30% faster than¬†[the RTX 4070 Ti](https://hothardware.com/reviews/asus-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-super-review). When its new RTX Neural Rendering features and DLSS 4 multi-frame gen are employed, however, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti can put up much higher framerates than any previous-gen card ‚Äì look to our Cyberpunk 2077 benchmarks to see the upside performance that's on tap. Whether you count those generated frames as additional performance is up for debate for some of you, but that fact is, every GPU manufacturer is reaching a point of diminishing returns with traditional rasterization within the limitations of current manufacturing processes, so using¬†[AI to generate frames](https://hothardware.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-multi-frame-gen-and-ton-of-fixes)¬†has a much more significant impact on the smoothness of on-screen animation. This topic merits a deeper discussion on its own, and is something all gamers and enthusiasts should ponder\n\n>That said, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is an upgrade over the previous generation nonetheless. It‚Äôs faster across the board in our game tests and AI and creator workloads perform better on it as well. If you‚Äôve got an RTX 40 series card, however, the significance of that upgrade is probably not motivation enough to take the leap. If you‚Äôve got a mainstream RTX 30-series card, however, it‚Äôs a different story. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a monster upgrade over the RTX 3070 Ti, not only for its updated GPU architecture but also for its 16GB GDDR7 frame buffer.\n\n>At an MSRP of $749, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti arrives at a $150 higher MSRP than¬†[the RTX 3070 Ti](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-and-benchmarks), but $50 lower than the RTX 4070 Ti. If you‚Äôve got an older GPU and are contemplating an upgrade, but don‚Äôt have a G or more to spend, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is worth a look. It‚Äôs got a bleeding-edge feature set, it's likely highly tweakable for overclocking, and DLSS 4 with multi-frame gen will only get more pervasive over time. There are some other new GPUs on the horizon though,¬†[from both AMD](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-radeon-rx-9070-launch-event-howto-watch-what-expect)¬†and NVIDIA, so perhaps sit tight for a bit to better understand the entire consumer graphics card landscape before parting with your hard-earned cash.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-as-msrp-card-in-test-interesting-chip-for-gamers-but-ventus-comes-from-ventilator/)\n\n>The RTX 5070 Ti offers strong performance in current AAA titles and is particularly optimized for 1440p gaming, while still achieving smooth frame rates in 4K with appropriate detail levels. Without ray tracing, it is around 12% ahead of the RTX 4070 Ti Super in WQHD and offers sufficient reserves for memory-intensive titles thanks to the high memory bandwidth of 896 GB/s. In Full HD, however, the CPU is often limited, which puts the performance advantages over the previous generation into perspective.\n\n>With active ray tracing, the demands on the GPU increase considerably. In native resolution without DLSS, the frame rates in demanding games sometimes fall below the 60 FPS mark. However, DLSS 3 and especially DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation (MFG) noticeably improve performance. The latter not only provides additional frames, but also optimizes frame pacing, resulting in more harmonious image reproduction. The efficiency of the tensor cores, which achieve almost native picture quality thanks to improved ray reconstruction technologies, is particularly evident in combination with patch tracing.\n\n>The MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus delivers solid performance in classic raster graphics scenarios and is ideal for WQHD gaming. Higher detail levels are possible in 4K, but not always at a stable 60 FPS, which is why upscaling technologies are often required. Compared to the RTX 4070 Ti Super with a nice factory OC, there is an average increase in performance of around 12% (around 16% better than a MSRP card), with CPU limitations in lower resolutions partially reducing the difference.\n\n>With ray tracing enabled, the MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus shows its strengths in combination with DLSS 4. The new multi-frame generation and ray reconstruction in particular enable playable frame rates, even in patch tracing scenarios, without any significant loss of quality. Compared to the previous generation, there is a significant leap forward here, especially in 4K with AI optimizations activated. The Ventus cooler represents a compromise between cost and performance. While temperatures are well controlled, the noise level under load is higher than that of high-end models. Overall, the MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus as an MSRP card remains an attractive choice for users who are looking for a powerful mid-range GPU with modern technology, but can live with small compromises in terms of cooling performance and noise.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/msi-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x-oc-review/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnHaarxf7pg)\n\n>As the third RTX 50 series GPU to hit the market, today we have analysed¬†**Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti**. It's been fascinating to see what sort of performance is on offer at the claimed ¬£729/$749 MSRP, given the¬†[RTX 5080](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-efficiency-gains-but-a-performance-letdown/)¬†and¬†[RTX 5090](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-ray-tracing-dlss-4-and-raw-power-explored/)¬†are eye-wateringly expensive.\n\n>Its price ‚Äì and name, of course! ‚Äì means the RTX 5070 Ti is positioned as the direct successor to the¬†[RTX 4070 Ti Super](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-super-review-ft-msi/), and the performance gains follow a similar trend to what we saw when comparing the RTX 5080 to the RTX 4080 Super. In short, we're looking at a 12% average performance boost at 4K, while it's 5% slower than the RTX 4080 Super and 7% faster than AMD's RX 7900 XT.\n\n>The RTX 5070 Ti is certainly capable of 4K gaming, especially if you enable upscaling, but it wouldn't surprise me if most prospective buyers were planning on pairing it with a high refresh 1440p screen. At that resolution, the relative gains over the 4070 Ti Super do shrink to just 9% on average, while it's 6% slower than the 4080 Super, but still faster than the RX 7900 XT by 5%.\n\n>When enabling ray tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti out-performs AMD's current flagship, the RX 7900 XTX, delivering performance that's 32% better, an expected result given Nvidia's dominance in this area. Scaling is otherwise very similar when compared to Nvidia's own GPUs though, as the RTX 5070 Ti is still 12% faster than the 4070 Ti Super at 4K ‚Äì the exact same margin observed in rasterisation performance.\n\n>Those sorts of performance gains gen-on-gen are hardly cause for wild celebration, but I do believe there's more reason to be positive about the RTX 5070 Ti than there was for the RTX 5080. For one, this new Blackwell GPU is 15% slower than its bigger brother, yet the MSRP is 25% lower, so that makes the RTX 5070 Ti the best value 50 series GPU yet.\n\n>Additionally, it gets a lot closer to the RTX 4080 Super than the RTX 5080 did to the 4090. It's still not¬†*quite*¬†there, being 5% slower on average, but the differences are even smaller in certain games ‚Äì and the thought of circa-4080 Super performance for ¬£729 doesn't sound too bad.\n\n>However, I was surprised to see a backwards step when it comes to efficiency. Nvidia officially rates the RTX 5070 Ti for 300W, though over my testing it averaged 283W at 4K. The RTX 5080 only drew 10W more on average however, and in fact I actually saw higher power draw from the 5070 Ti in certain games. I'd theorise that, as a cutdown GB203 die, RTX 5070 Ti could be lower quality silicon so it requires a more aggressive voltage/frequency curve, but it's hard to say for definite.\n\n>In any case, power draw being so close to the RTX 5080 while performing worse means that efficiency has regressed, with the 5070 Ti offering performance per Watt that's 13% lower. It's not the direction we would expect, as usually the lower-power GPUs are more efficient, so it'll be fascinating to see how the RTX 5070 (non-Ti) performs in this regard.\n\n# [LanOC](https://lanoc.org/review/video-cards/9143-asus-prime-rtx-5070-ti)\n\n>For performance, the Prime RTX 5070 Ti trades blows with the RTX 4080 and 4080 SUPER depending on the type of test. My averaged in game results had it out ahead just slightly. But as a whole DX 11 and Ray Tracing/DLSS results will have the Prime RTX 5070 Ti faster and in base DX12 tests it will fall behind the 4080. I would have liked to of seen this be at least consistently ahead of both of the RTX 4080 models. Overall that still does translate to being able to throw anything at it at 1440p and you can play at 4k in some situations. The Prime RTX 5070 Ti cooler was impressive in its noise tests, punching way above its weight class there. For cooling it did okay but Asus had an aggressive fan profile to do that, thankfully given the noise performance they could do that without it being too loud. Like with the other 50 Series cards, DLSS 4 performance was impressive and the changes Nvidia has made to DLSS have also improved the smoothness and picture when gaming with DLSS.\n\n>For pricing, as always pricing at launch is subject to change quickly. The launch MSRP of the RTX 5070 Ti and with the Prime RTX 5070 Ti tested is $749 so that is what I have to go by here. But we all know that cards at those price points are hard to come by and the more expensive overclocked cards will be what you will more often find assuming you can find them at all. We have just had tariffs that have changed GPU pricing across the board and with that I have updated our 3dMark Time Spy Extreme score per dollar chart that is above. At the MSRP the Prime RTX 5070 Ti is about as good as you can get right now for anything targeting 1440p or 4k gaming. I know a lot of people will be looking at how the RTX 5070 Ti compares with the RTX 4080 and RTX 4080 SUPER and MSRP for MSRP the $749 MSRP is still much better than the $1199 for the original RTX 4080 and $999 of the RTX 4080 SUPER and frankly, both cards are even more expensive than that to get right now if you can find them at all. With that in mind, the Prime RTX 5070 Ti competing with those cards is an improvement at the $750 price point but depending on the price we see overclocked cards that can change quickly.\n\n# [PC World Article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2612343/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review.html)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v7KboWkdu0)\n\n>If you want a high-performance graphics card capable of flying through 1440p and 4K gaming, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a no-brainer among currently available options. Gaming only gets better once you flip on Multi Frame Generation in 75 supported games and apps ‚Äì the visual smoothness it provides is truly transformative, even if you‚Äôre coming from a 4080 Super already. Just ask Adam!\n\n>I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying the RTX 5070 Ti if you‚Äôve already got a comparable RTX 40-series card. But if you‚Äôre coming from the 30-series or prior, and willing to hold your nose over¬†*how much more*¬†graphics cards cost now ‚Äì the¬†[RTX 3070 Ti](https://www.pcworld.com/article/394671/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review.html)¬†cost $600 and the¬†[2070 Super cost $500](https://www.pcworld.com/article/397702/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-super-rtx-2070-super-review.html), before inflation ‚Äì you‚Äôll love the RTX 5070 Ti. The jump forward in raw performance alone is worth it, and then adding MFG on top (in dozens of supported titles) can make your games feel like a whole new experience.\n\n>With a roughly 25 percent leap in performance¬†*plus*¬†Multi Frame Gen, for $50 less than its predecessor, the RTX 5070 Ti offers a compelling all-around package ‚Äì one that, unfortunately, the RTX 5080 didn‚Äôt quite nail. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is absolutely the enthusiast-grade graphics card I‚Äôd buy right now if I were shopping around‚Ä¶ though you may want to see what AMD‚Äôs imminent Radeon RX 9070 XT offers when it hits the streets in early March.\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x/)\n\n>At 4K resolution, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 28% performance uplift over the RTX 4070 Ti, which is pretty good for a gen-over-gen improvement. While it's not as big as the RTX 5090, which is 36% faster than the RTX 4090, it's definitely better than the 15% that we got on RTX 5080 a few weeks ago. Just like with RTX 5090, NVIDIA achieves their \"twice the performance every second generation\" rule: the RTX 5070 Ti is twice as fast as the RTX 3070 Ti. This means the card matches performance of the RTX 4080 and RTX 4080 Super, and it's also beating AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX flagship by a wafer-thin margin. Impressive‚ÄîNVIDIA's 3rd card in the lineup beats AMD's #1. And this is with pure rasterization‚Äîonce you turn on ray tracing, the gap gets much bigger.\n\n>For this launch, NVIDIA provided us with the MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus OC, which, as the name reveals, is a factory overclocked card. This means that it has a small performance advantage‚Äîall the other comparison cards in our tests are clocked at reference. So, if you plan on buying a baseline card, subtract a percent or two from our performance numbers. Once cards appear in the market I will buy a pure base clock card, for comparisons in future reviews. There is no Founders Edition for the RTX 5070 Ti.\n\n>While RTX 5070 Ti is a very decent card for gaming at 4K, it's not a fire-and-forget solution. There are several titles that run at less than 60 FPS when maxed out (without RT and upscaling). I'd say RTX 5080 is a better choice for demanding 4K gaming, but considering the price differences, I think lowering details slightly or using upscaling / frame generation is a very reasonable approach. For 1440p, the RTX 5070 Ti is awesome, here it can achieve excellent frame rates and will be able to drive high-refresh-rate displays very well.\n\n>NVIDIA's MSRP for the RTX 5070 Ti Series is $750, which is very reasonable for the performance you're getting. Actually, this MSRP is $50 lower than the $800 price point that both the 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti Super launched at. There has been lots of controversy about fake MSRPs, and this has been going on for years now, so do expect higher prices in stores. The primary driver for this is supply and demand, if everybody wants a product, its supply won't be sufficient and prices will go up. For the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 supply was very low, too, making the situation even worse. I've plotted various alternative price points in our price/performance charts, reaching up to $1100, which, according to some early postings might end up being a realistic price point. We'll know more tomorrow, when sales go up.\n\n>MSI's RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X is priced at the NVIDIA MSRP, which is nice (as long as it's true and there's supply). Since there is no Founders Edition this time, there really isn't a baseline to compare to. Today we also tested the Galax RTX 5070 Ti 1-Click OC, which is MSRP as well, but comes with a much better cooler and much better noise levels. Still, the Ventus is definitely not bad. It is able to deliver the full RTX 5070 Ti experience, just with a little bit higher noise levels out of the box. Considering that, I'm having serious doubts whether I would be willing to spend, +$200, +$300 or even more for any custom design‚Äîwe've seen pricing like that on some RTX 5070 Ti cards! Maybe $50-70 for a better cooler that runs really quiet, but that's about it.\n\n>There really isn't any alternative to the 5070 Ti in this segment, and NVIDIA knows that, and they designed the card with that in mind. No reason to give you +50% of anything if there's no competing product. AMD's flagship, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX currently sells for $820, with less performance, especially in RT, higher power draw and no DLSS. The RTX 4080 and 4080 Super are priced at around $1000 these days‚Äîno reason to buy them unless they are heavily discounted and end up below 5070 Ti pricing. What else is there? RTX 4090? Super expensive because people buy them for AI. RTX 5080 and 5090? Sold out, scalped to several thousand dollars. Let's hope that supply of RTX 5070 Ti is better and gamers can actually get their hands on these new cards.\n\n>AMD is set to release the Radeon RX 9070 Series shortly, but it probably won't match the performance of the RTX 5070 Ti. Instead, it seems it will be more comparable to the RTX 5070, which is also expected to be released soon. While these new cards cannot rival the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of performance, they are likely to be priced more competitively due to increased competition in this market segment.\n\n# [The FPS Review](https://www.thefpsreview.com/2025/02/19/asus-prime-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-video-card-review/)\n\n>**In raster performance**: Alan Wake 2 11%, Black Myth Wukong 13%, Cyberpunk 2077 9%, Dying Light 2 16%, F1 24 3%, Horizon Forbidden West 7%, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle 6%, Kingdom Come Deliverance II 13%, Stalker 2 7%, Star Wars Outlaws 6%.\n\n>If we take an average of those percentages, then in raster the average uplift of the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti over the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is¬†**9%**.

At 9% more performance, the ASUS PRIME GeForce¬†RTX 5070 Ti was more competitive with the uplift over the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER.\n\n>The important part is the MSRP, this is a $749 MSRP video card, and you really want to stay within this range with the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. If this card is available in stock, and at $749, it can provide a decent upgrade from generations of the GeForce RTX 30 series, and down the generations. If you currently have a GeForce RTX 40 series, it would only be an upgrade from a lower tier such as the RTX 4060. If you are in the market for a new GPU at the $749 price point, the¬†[ASUS PRIME GeForce¬†RTX 5070 Ti](https://www.asus.com/us/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rtx5070ti-16g/)¬†is a great option offering that just gives you that right balance of what you need out of a video card at this price range.\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review-asus)\n\n>Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti deserves plenty of accolades. It delivers solid high-end performance, taking over from where the 4070 Ti Super left off. It's not revolutionary, but at least it's (generally) faster and cuts the price by $50. There's still work to be done by Nvidia on the drivers, however, as there's really no good reason why the 4070 Ti Super and even the slower 4070 Ti should, at times, beat the new 5070 Ti.\n\n>While the more expensive RTX 5080 felt disappointing for only offering minor performance improvements over the existing 4080 / 4080 Super, and for sticking with 16GB of VRAM, the 5070 Ti can get away with 16GB by virtue of costing $749. It's only about 10‚Äì15 percent faster than its immediate predecessor, but it's also 20‚Äì30 percent faster than its direct namesake. And it has some extra stuff that the prior generation lacks.\n\n>Part of the difficulty with Nvidia's latest GPUs is that the names have shifted upward. The xx70-class GPUs at one point cost around $300‚Äì$400. Then they became $599 and even $799 parts. Now the 5070 Ti walks that back slightly with a $749 base MSRP. In a sense, it's actually carrying on from the $699 RTX 3080 and the $649 GTX 1080 Ti. Sure, the number has changed, but Nvidia has been trying to stretch the range of GPUs to much higher price segments and has changed the nomenclature as it sees fit.\n\n>The RTX 5070 Ti strikes a good balance between performance, features, and value. It's still an expensive high-end card, but it's certainly a better value than the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080. It's also not faster (most of the time) than the previous generation RTX 4080, at least not unless you want to factor in MFG ‚Äî and perhaps you should.\n\n>Frame generation tends to be a polarizing topic, with Nvidia acting like it's the same as normally rendered frames. At the other extreme are the \"never framegen\" people who act like it has completely ruined every game that uses the technique. The reality falls somewhere in between.\n\n>MFG is not a bad option to have, is how we view it. On the right games, it can make them look and feel better. Sometimes, it breaks, and you need to tweak some other settings to get the desired result, but again, It's not bad to have options.\n\n>MFG is one more tool in Nvidia's bag of tricks, and it can be helpful in the right situations. It's just not universally better in all situations. It also tends to work and feel better when the baseline performance is sufficiently high. If the final performance is only 100 FPS, meaning a 25 FPS input sampling rate with MFG 4X, that might feel worse than the native 40 FPS to some people.\n\n>So, who is Nvidia targeting with the RTX 5070 Ti? People with an RTX 3070 to 3080 (or lower) GPU who want to upgrade will find plenty to like. It will be about 50% faster in raw performance, and the new features can make it feel like more of a step up than that. At least there are no glaring flaws with the product other than concerns with availability and the possibility of scalpers spoiling the party. But if you already have an RTX 40-series GPU, you should give this generation a pass until something truly compelling comes out.\n\n>We also need to see what actual pricing and availability look like. At $749, the RTX 5070 Ti represents a reasonable high-end graphics card worth purchasing. If the price climbs to $899 or more, however, it becomes far less compelling. We‚Äôve heard there will be more 5070 Ti cards at launch than all the 5090 and 5080 cards that have been sold so far, combined. But there are no concrete numbers, and Nvidia has a tradition of selling out on just about every new GPU generation. The 5070 Ti will likely keep that trend going for at least the first few weeks of its existence.\n\n# [Computerbase - German](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-test.91379/)\n\n# [HardwareLuxx - German](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65525-auf-niveau-der-geforce-rtx-4080-die-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-im-test.html)\n\n# [PCGH - German](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5070-Ti-Grafikkarte-281031/Tests/Release-Preis-Test-Benchmarks-vs-5080-1466041/)\n\n# [Elchapuzasinformatico - Spanish](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2025/02/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x-review/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n# Video Review\n\n# [Der8auer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bKu3O57OJM)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlWmYg7Vr3Q)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2dqGTJ_Hj4)\n\n# [Gamers Nexus Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhtVic3Vm0Y)\n\n# Hardware Canucks\n\n# [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMPK1SeMEZM)\n\n# [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhSA5LYA8XU)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnHaarxf7pg)\n\n# [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf6_Jjvik34)\n\n# [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnhU2ZvHb10)\n\n# OC3D Video\n\n# [Optimum Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVK2FBWcnEo)\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v7KboWkdu0)\n\n# [Techtesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GSCc98ZxmA)\n\n# [Tech Yes City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0bdO2SLA6c)",

      "A 70 level card that doesn't even beat previous 80 card. WTF.",
      "TLDR: Good-ish card. 4080/4080 super level of performance. Worth at $750 but bad value at the current price most are being listed on so either try your luck with an msrp listing or wait till things calm down",
      "5070ti has 16gb of vram, the same as a 4080",
      "\"things calm down\" sir its been years",
      "I mean the 80 generation card barely beat the previous 80 card and sipped back an extra 40w to do it, what were you really expecting? \n\nThis whole gen smacks of 'we made a ton of new datacenter AI chips and tried to shoehorn them into rasterization to appease the peasant gamers - this is the best we got from cranking up the TDP and slapping more AI bullshit on'.",
      "\"an RTX 4080 becomes a better buy due its higher vram capacity\"\n\nWhat does this mean?",
      "Are you implying they're being negative just to gain views?  Maybe it's because emotion is expressed better in video?  Read these reviews again.  While on the performance side it remains positive, on the price side, they all share the same sentiment.",
      "I might try for one.\n\nIf I can get one for $800, I will go for it, anything more and I will skip this generation.",
      "Yes, thats the 5070, but this is about 5070 ti, which also has 16",
      "It's okay but it could be better I agree. I'd want high vram like this starting at $300. Once you hit $600+ I would probably want more yeah.",
      "Objectively it's not great.",
      "50 series generation:\n\nBarely, if any upgrades in preformance...\n\n5090s are rarer the platinum, in addition to being basically a terse upgrade mostly helped by Vram\n\n5080s are the worst value card nvidia ever produced, and the first 80 series card to fail in comparison to the previous gen 4090s.\n\n5070s are (barely) okay, but hilariously overpriced.\n\nFake Frames\n\nBurning Cables\n\nAI NONSENSE\n\nPC gaming is dead",
      "Finding a lot of 4090s at $1599 are we? Because I haven't seen shit in over 2 years",
      "> Alternatively you can also make clickbait titles and thumbnail and say it's the worst GPU ever.  \n\nWhich review did that?",
      "The 5070 ti is fine for the normal recommended price. 16 Gb Vram and great overclock potential , basically a similar card as the 4080 super but cheaper.¬†\nThe normal 5070 however sounds almost like a scam especially with only 12gb Vram.",
      "sir 4000 series was easily available at MSRP. But ofc people in this sub dont have the mental capacity ro realize that",
      "15-25% like-for-like would‚Äôve been acceptable. +8% is a bad joke.",
      "Nice cherry picking only going back 11 years and 5 generations? No, as I stated I am on mobile and you are making me do all of the work to have this conversation. What would be cherry picking is if I pointed out that until the 3000 series aib partners often launched *even cheaper* versions of the card, while modern practice is that it is very rare for aibs to even match msrp. But sure let's keep going back.\n\n\n* 275 was 259 in 2009\n* 470 was 349 in 2010\n* 570 was 349 in 2010\n* 670 was 399 in 2012\n* 770 was 399 in 2013\n\n\nSo actually we have stronger data about how the price is trending up over time, and example data showing Nvidia overvaluing their 70 series on the past and course correcting with the 970 (albeit, with a major lawsuit involved for fake cram).¬†\n\n\nSo adjusted for inflation, and cherry picking in your favor, the 470 would be $510.89 in today's dollars. That's a 7.8% price increase¬†assuming a 5070 MSRP. There's also the increase in taxes that I'll ignore because I'm lazy and it varies anyways.\n\n\nBased on current data for 5000 series we can easily expect a 25 to 35% increase from MSRP, putting the card at about $715, which puts it at 40% over the inflation adjusted 470 msrp, which is exactly what I calculated before on a 970 (albeit without inflation adjustment).\n\n\nI haven't even touched on their scale in gross profitability since 2010. In 2010 they made $1.17 billion, $1.7 billion adjusted for inflation. Now in 2024 they reported $44.3 billion, but I'll be nice and use 2022 instead at at $17.475 billion inflation adjusted to $18.74 billion.¬†\n\n\nSo depending on which side we get to cherry pick from the company has seen an increase of 11-26x gross profitability while raising the price of the 70 series price 8 to 40%.¬†\n\n\nSo take your pick, I guess.",

Pricing doesn't make sense but it still technically performs extraordinarily well in cooling and overclocking compared to other 5070 Ti's so far. I'm not sure which niche that falls into when this is more than the MSRP of the 5080 though.",

And I'm not really worried about thermals, it's that the msi vanguard is running at 24db at full load, that is basically silent, and 5db more quiet than my current card. Like I said, I really value quiet parts (my entire case is filled with noctua).\n\nI wouldn't go buy a 5070ti, but if someone offered me to trade, I would absolutely do it and even throw in like $200-300 or something.",

    "selftext": "- compilation of 16 launch reviews with ~6420 gaming benchmarks at 1080p, 1440p, 2160p\n- only benchmarks at real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks\n- geometric mean in all cases\n- standard raster performance without ray-tracing and/or DLSS/FSR/XeSS\n- extra ray-tracing benchmarks (mostly without upscaler) after the standard raster benchmarks\n- stock performance on (usually) reference/FE boards, no overclocking\n- factory overclocked cards were normalized to reference clocks/performance, but just for the overall performance average (so the listings show the original performance result, just the performance index has been normalized)\n- missing results were extrapolated (for a more accurate average) based on the available & former results\n- performance average is (some) weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks\n- all reviews should have used newer drivers for _all_ cards\n- power draw numbers based on a couple of reviews, always for the graphics card only\n- performance/price ratio (higher is better) for 1440p raster performance and 1440p ray-tracing performance\n- for the full results and some more explanations check [3DCenter's launch analysis](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti)\n\nNote: There are hardly any performance results available for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB. Therefore, their performance was extrapolated for the overview table based solely on the difference between 4060Ti-8GB and 4060Ti-16GB, taking into account a small offset due to the different TDP (which does not exist for the 5060Ti).\n\nNote: Sometimes the following tables are become to big (wide) for mobile browsers on Reddit (last column is the GeForce RTX 5070). In this case, please try the [mobile version of

RA = Raster, RT = Ray-Tracing, E.Eff. = Energy Efficiency, P/P = Performance/Price Ratio    \nNote: retail prices assuming real availability - for old SKUs, these are typically from the years 2023/2024; for the Radeon RX 9070 it's simple an assumption\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**On the performance of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti _16GB_:** The card beats the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti with +14-17% more performance, in line with the gains of most other RTX50 cards. Another advantage of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is that the 16 GB version is now the primary version (in contrast to the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti) and also comes at no major additional cost. On the AMD side, the Radeon RX 7700 XT is only a suitable counterpart at raster rendering, but is clearly beaten at ray tracing - and of course also has the smaller amount of VRAM. At best, the Radeon RX 7800 XT is a passable opponent to the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, but also costs a little more (in Europe). Unfortunately, the US prices are difficult to assess at the moment, as the US market is completely overbought.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Important note on the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti _8GB_:** The above performance evaluation based on average frame rates does not show the complete picture for this GPU. But even with average frame rates, it can be seen that the card lags behind in raster rendering from 2160p, but in ray tracing from 1080p. However, differences at average frame rates are always only the very last sign of too less VRAM. Long before that, there are already (sometimes considerable) disadvantages at the minimum frame rates as well as a declining image quality due to missing textures, delayed loading textures or even a generally lower texture quality. This was explained quite well in a video by [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdZoa6Gzl6s), and is a known problem with too less VRAM. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB is therefore already borderline even under 1080p and can therefore not be recommended with a clear conscience for a GPU purchase in 2025.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nList of hardware reviews evaluated for this analysis:\n\n- [ComputerBase](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-test.92119/)\n- [Cowcotland](https://www.cowcotland.com/articles/4571/test-gainward-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-python-blackwell-enfin-pour-le-plus-grand-nombre.html)\n- [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n- [Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cskegn1-D7s)\n- [Hardware & Co](https://hardwareand.co/dossiers/gpu/test-de-la-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-enfin-une-carte-blackwell-capable-de-faire-oublier-sa-devanciere)\n- [Hardwareluxx](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65938-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-mit-16-gb-im-test.html)\n- [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-im-test-sparsam-im-verbrauch-aber-nicht-ganz-unproblematisch-fuer-gamer/)\n- [KitGuru](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review-ft-gigabyte-palit/)\n- [PC Games Hardware](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5060-Ti-16GB-Grafikkarte-281131/Tests/Release-Review-Preis-kaufen-Benchmark-Specs-1470373/)\n- [PurePC](https://www.purepc.pl/test-msi-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-gaming-recenzja-opinia-wydajnosc-cena-premiera-blackwell)\n- [Quasarzone](https://quasarzone.com/bbs/qc_bench/views/94640)\n- [SweClockers](https://www.sweclockers.com/test/41012-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-mellankort-mellanpris-mellanbra)\n- [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/palit-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-infinity-3-16-gb/)\n- [TechSpot](https://www.techspot.com/review/2979-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb/) / [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6qZwJsp5X4)\n- [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n- [Tweakers](https://tweakers.net/reviews/13162/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-haalt-de-lat-maar-die-lag-niet-hoog.html)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource: [3DCenter.org](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti)\n\nPS: 3DCenter is free of advertising and is financed solely by donations.",

      "Nvidia is really trying to make each new product a hard buy",
      "Only a 30% performance gain over the 3060 Ti after 4.5 years.\n\nI‚Äôve become bearish on meaningful value gains in newer generations of hardware going forward. Not even a drastic node shrink (from Samsung 8N to TSMC N4), was enough to provide a meaningful cost-per-frame improvement from the 3060 Ti to the 4060 Ti. When the next node shrink occurs with the 6060 Ti, I expect Nvidia to pass very little cost savings to the consumer.\n\nPeople who expect good value gains will be waiting a looong time for a card that provides just that. It ironically makes the 16GB 5060 Ti a solid card to buy; it‚Äôs a card specifically designed for people who wait.",
      "I honestly think the x60 cards would be quite solid across the board if they weren't vram limited\n\nI rarely hit the limits of what my hardware can actually do, because I'm always running of vram and losing 70% of my framerate",
      "the 5060 ti 16gb is the only card worth it, and only for people who are still running 6gb/8gb versions of the older x060 ti cards\n\nit's not even something that shows up in benchmarks.\n\nthose 8gb cards absolutely shit the bed the millisecond vram starts paging, and they have effective \\~6.5GB because of what windows' compositor is always stealing.\n\nif you turn off dlss and frame gen you might get lucky and run with low enough vram usage to be stable.\n\nbut if you run with dlss and fg on, you're fucked. like with oblivion I used engine.ini edits to force the engine to limit its streaming pool and effects so that they only consume 70% of my vram, but the game isn't the problem.. frame gen is. turning frame gen on increases my 50fps to \\~80-100, sounds good, til you notice it also increases vram usage by 15% the second you toggle it on. then you start paging out of vram and it's stutterville at 20fps, frame gen just straight up disables, and if you disable dlss your native fps has gone from 50 to 14.\n\nbeen dealing with this since the 2060 series because I constantly end up with the low vram x060 ti card. this time around I threw in the extra $100 to get the 16gb version.\n\nI don't even care if the perf gains are minimal. you can give me 15% higher fps, but that extra vram meaning I no longer deal with incessant framerate drops in every single AAA+ makes it worth every penny",

I will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links. This will be sorted alphabetically.\n\n# Written Articles\n\n# [Babeltechreviews](https://babeltechreviews.com/rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review/)\n\n>The¬†**Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti**¬†is a competent midrange GPU that brings incremental improvements over its predecessor, especially when leveraging¬†**DLSS 4**. It performs well at¬†**1080p and 1440p**, and offers solid gains if coming from a¬†**30-series or older**¬†card. Content creators also benefit from enhanced NVENC support for faster 4:2:2 video encoding. Its compact design, low power draw, and frame generation capabilities make it a practical choice for mainstream gamers and small form factor builds.\n\n>However, for a¬†**new generation card**, the performance gains are modest‚Äîtypically around¬†**10‚Äì15% over the RTX 4060 Ti**‚Äîmaking it a hard sell unless priced at or below MSRP. If prices drift north of $449,¬†**AMD‚Äôs RX 7700 XT or 7800 XT**¬†become better buys with more VRAM and stronger raster performance. Ultimately, the RTX 5060 Ti is a¬†**fine choice at the right price**¬†but fails to impress as a major step forward. Wait for discounts or consider stepping up to an RTX 4070 Super or AMD 7800 XT if your budget allows.\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n\n# Digital Foundry Video\n\n>With our testing complete, the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is a tricky card to judge, given that its performance differentials can swing substantially based on the game and even game scene tested.¬†\n\n>Based on¬†*our*¬†game selections though, the card is in the same territory as the RX 7800 XT, with an average 22 percent lead over the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB at 1440p. That's one of the biggest gen-on-gen gains that we've seen going from Ada Lovelace to Blackwell, but it's worth considering that the RTX 4060 Ti didn't really shift the needle when it came to beating its predecessor.¬†\n\n>For those upgrading from prior cards in the same class, there's around a 37 percent increase over the RTX 3060 Ti from 2020. Meanwhile, versus the 2019 vintage RTX 2060 Super, you're getting double the performance. In both cases, the DLSS 4 feature set is appealing and I'd consider the RTX 5060 Ti a fine upgrade there.¬†\n\n>Elsewhere, the RTX 5070 is significantly faster than the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB - to the tune of a mighty 38 percent. My results also see the RTX 4070 beat the RTX 5060 Ti by 11 percent, though overclocking can make up most of the difference in many games.¬†\n\n>Based on the RTX 5060 Ti's overall performance, the card is solid enough but hardly spectacular - meaning that price comes into focus. Looking at dollars per frame based on MSRP, it's disappointing that the RTX 5070 offers better value - and I can't help but think there ought to have been a single 16GB or even 12GB model at $399. (Despite the 128-bit bus, 3GB memory modules do exist that would have unlocked 12GB as a potential option - though it's unclear whether they're available in the quantities and prices needed for a budget GPU.)¬†\n\n>So as we keep saying, the RTX 5060 Ti is a bit tricky. The 8GB card on mixed benchmarks will provide better value than the 16GB version overall and compares more favourably to the RTX 5070. On the flipside, we just can't recommend the 8GB card given how often we're running into VRAM issues with many games, especially upon launch.¬†\n\n>The 16GB version is the one to have then, but with the 5070 offering 35 to 43 percent better performance at \"only\" 28 percent more money, you're again funnelled towards the higher-priced offering - though $120 extra is a significant step up in this sector of the market. I just wish that Nvidia understood that value is supposed to increase the further down the stack you go - not decrease.¬†\n\n>The PCIe situation is also not great, with the 5060 Ti's 8x lanes translating into some noticeable performance degradation on older PCIe 3.0 motherboards due to bandwidth limitations. While the majority of users will be using these cards with modern motherboards with PCIe 4.0 or 5.0 slots, these more budget-oriented cards are more likely to be used with similarly low-end or just antiquated motherboards compared to higher-end GPUs. Our testing shows up to a 20 percent performance drop in¬†[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle](https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review)¬†at 1080p, with less sizeable double-digit percentage drops in¬†[F1 24](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-24)¬†and single-digit percentage drops in¬†[Black Myth: Wukong](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong).¬†\n\n>Ultimately, there are question marks over value, but the RTX 5060 Ti is worth taking a look at.¬†\n\n# [eTeknix Article](https://www.eteknix.com/asus-prime-oc-rtx-5060-ti-graphics-card-review/)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR5phLkePYA)\n\n>So, a bit of a tangent, but back on track. The 3060 Ti was a good card when it came out, but is definitely showing its age, and with the 5060 Ti sitting 29% ahead overall, there‚Äôs definitely a viable option to buy it, especially as 3060 Ti‚Äôs are still holding their price for some weird reason. The 4060 Ti however, sees the 5060 Ti around 19% faster and while, and I‚Äôm sure NVIDIA will be happy for me to say this, it has multi-frame generation upscaling which works some kind of voodoo magic, but people still aren‚Äôt sold on it, but the tide is turning somewhat.\n\n>If NVIDIA came in with a GPU that offered a 30% generation uplift or higher in rasterisation, and higher in raytracing gen on gen, plus MFG, then yes, I think it would be much better received, but that‚Äôs not the case, and instead, if you‚Äôre already on a 40 series card, I can‚Äôt say there‚Äôs an argument to upgrade to any 50 series, with maybe the exception being the RTX 5090, but that‚Äôs in a whole different league. Beyond that, people are looking for a reason to upgrade and I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm getting a bit bored of saying things like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good but‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou should buy it if you can get it for $X‚Äù. The argument is wearing a bit thin.\n\n>I will say that the 5060 Ti on paper, if you take pricing out of the equation, does come across as a good performer. It even sits ahead of the 3070 Ti, and that‚Äôs what we want to see. The other issue is AMD. At that price point, AMD are the better buy, but again, and I swear this will be the second to last time I say it, but AMD cards are inflated too, so I‚Äôll leave you with one piece of advice, and it‚Äôs a big one.\n\n>Regardless, the 5060 Ti is good, but it feels like it‚Äôs much the same as we‚Äôve seen with the rest of the stack. If the price is right, and you‚Äôre not already on a 40 series card, then there‚Äôs an argument, but if the price isn‚Äôt right and/or you‚Äôre already on a 40 series card, then maybe give this one a miss, unless MFG really tickles your fancy.\n\n>For now, that‚Äôs going to wrap up another 50 series GPU review. With a not-so-easy-to-understand conclusion, I‚Äôd like to think we‚Äôve at least shown you the facts, and that you can make an educated decision as to what to do from there based on that all-important word. Price.\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review/)\n\n>The RTX 5060 Ti is built around a rasterizer shading engine and includes 4608 CUDA cores. It stems from the RTX 50 series, which introduces a new generation of Ray Tracing and Tensor cores positioned close to the shader engine. These RT cores never pause as they produce vivid lighting, shadow, and reflection effects. Although Tensor cores sometimes seem tricky to measure in terms of raw benefits, their influence becomes obvious when paired with DLSS3 and the updated DLSS4.¬†The 50 series represents more than a mere upgrade; it stands as a leap forward that meets different gaming requirements. Whether someone is immersed in 2K (2560x1440) gaming or venturing into the realm of 4K (3840x2160), the RTX 5060 Ti adapts when you enable DLSS4/MFG. In baseline performance (depending on where and what you measure), expect reference cards to be \\~15% faster than the 4060 Ti, and OC models closing in at perhaps 20% for the fastest locked and configured models.\n\n>The RTX 5060 Ti steps onto the stage, immediately ingraining gamers with very decent frame rates. Sure, it might lag slightly behind some close competitors when it comes to standardized shading, but overall, the graphics performance is solid enough.¬†What's interesting is that the improvement isn't uniform across all games. One title might skyrocket with huge frame rate gains, while another enjoys just a modest boost. But the real star of the show is NVIDIA‚Äôs heavy investment in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and neural shading technologies. Activate DLSS4 with frame generation set at 4x (if possible), and the difference is obvious right away‚Äîit feels like catching a glimpse of gaming‚Äôs future.¬†Yet, there's a lingering question among gamers: Is the community ready to fully embrace these AI-powered enhancements? Technology evolves so quickly these days, and some players are hesitant to fully rely on machine learning to boost their gaming visuals and performance. However, early adopters aren't holding back; they're diving right in. As more players see what DLSS4 can achieve, particularly in new, visually demanding games, the excitement is sure to spread.¬†There's no doubt about it‚ÄîDLSS4 is impressive, and early performance data backs this up. Gamers using ultra-wide or 1440p monitors will especially appreciate how every pixel gets pushed to its limits. And those chasing ultimate 4K experiences will also find plenty to love. By combining the raw power of the RTX 5060 Ti with DLSS4's dynamic upscaling, games can now achieve frame rates that were once considered impossible.¬†While some might label the RTX 5060 Ti as just a mainstream GPU, it‚Äôs actually much more versatile. It comfortably handles high-end AAA games without breaking a sweat, making it perfect for gamers who don't always need every setting maxed but still want smooth, impressive performance. Additionally, content creators and professionals using GPU-heavy tasks like video editing or 3D rendering will find the 5060 series quite capable. Its powerful CUDA cores speed up rendering, giving creators valuable extra time.¬†Of course, true enthusiasts might already have their eyes set on the higher-end 5070 Ti or 5080 models, but the RTX 5060 Ti hits a better price point for most PC gamers\n\n>Priced around the $429 mark, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti seems promising enough. Whether it becomes your next favorite GPU depends on how expensive it'll sell once it hits the shelves. But overall it's a product series that we can recommend if you're coming from the RTX 3000 or equivalent graphics card era.\n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/msi-and-pny-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-review)\n\n>Like some of the other members of the¬†[GeForce RTX 50 series](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-architecture-overview), the new GeForce RTX 5060 Ti¬†offers a modest upgrade in rasterization performance over its previous-gen counterpart If we don't factor in newer technologies and DLSS 4 with multi frame generation, the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is about \\~20% faster than the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. For the millions of gamers still using lower-end or older \"xx60\" class cards, however,¬†GeForce RTX 5060 Ti would be significant upgrade. Not only is the¬†GeForce RTX 5060 Ti much faster than older cards for gaming, but it's got better display output support, a more capable media engine, and its power requirements are modest enough that most folks won't need a PSU upgrade either -- just stick with the 16GB version if you've got the budget. 8GB cards are going to be much more limited moving forward.\n\n>With an MSRP of $429, the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti's introductory price comes in a bit higher than 8GB GeForce RTX 4060 Ti cards, but below 16GB variants that were introduced later. Assuming gamers will be able to get their hands on¬†GeForce RTX 5060 Tis for prices approaching MSRP, it represents a good value and a significant upgrade for gamers and creators still rocking RTX 30 series, or older, cards in the same class. As we've mentioned with the other GeForce RTX 50 series cards, the¬†GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is¬†faster, more capable, and more power-efficient than its previous generation counterpart and anyone that likes tinker will have plenty of fun overclocking. Without leveraging DLSS 4‚Äôs multi frame generation, its generational performance uplift is smaller than what we‚Äôve seen from NVIDIA in the past, though.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-in-test-economical-consumption-surprisingly-fast-but-not-with-8gb/)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB tested today marks the current entry of NVIDIA‚Äôs Blackwell architecture into the mid-range segment and takes on the established competition with the new GB206-300 chip. While the 8 GB version can hardly be meaningfully tested in modern scenarios due to the limited memory configuration, the 16 GB version is the focus of all meaningful analyses. The GPU is based on four 32-bit memory channels and uses the clamshell method to expand capacity, allowing a total of eight 2 GB GDDR7 modules to be used. Despite identical bandwidth to the 8 GB version of 448 GB/s at 28 Gbps memory clock, this results in improved suitability for memory-intensive applications, but without an increase in memory bandwidth.\n\n>The gaming performance of the RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB is convincing in current titles, especially when DLSS 4 and Frame Generation are activated. In a direct comparison with the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB, the new card is 23 percent ahead on average with AI functions enabled, and still around 17 to 18 percent ahead without factory overclocking. The strong increase in minimum frame rates (P1 Low) is remarkable, where up to 36 percent lead was measured. This leads to a significantly more stable gaming experience, especially at WQHD resolution. Efficiency has been noticeably improved, as performance is clearly higher with comparable power consumption. Under full gaming load, the average power consumption is between 155 and 165 watts, while the power limit of 180 watts is generally not exhausted. Even under extreme conditions, the card remains thermally and electrically stable.\n\n>My test with the MSI GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Gaming Trio showed that high-quality board partner designs can exploit the full potential of the GPU. The card comes with factory overclocking, which results in around 2 to 3 percent more performance than a reference card. The cooling design with four heatpipes, a solid copper block and a fin array with a high air flow rate ensures low GPU temperatures of around 63 ¬∞C in gaming mode. The memory modules remain below 68 ¬∞C, also thanks to the generous cooling through the backplate and via separate pads. Acoustically, the card remains very quiet at around 31 dB(A) under load, with only a minimal audible whirring of the coils. The power supply via a total of eight phases delivered stable voltage values, even with manual overclocking.\n\n>All in all, the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB can be characterized as a modern mid-range GPU, which is primarily aimed at users who do not want to do without the latest technologies such as DLSS 4, Reflex 2 and ray tracing, but do not want to spend 500 euros or more on a graphics card. With an RRP of 429 US dollars, the card is significantly lower than the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB at market launch and also offers more memory, better efficiency and a modern architecture. It is a particularly attractive option for upgrades from the RTX 3000 or RX 6000 generation. The 8 GB version, on the other hand, should be viewed critically, as it quickly reaches its limits, especially in WQHD and memory-intensive scenarios, and cannot provide a complete picture of the performance of this GPU generation, even if you can perhaps save a one-off 50 USD. In other words, a card with two faces, where the only slightly cheaper offer is clearly the worse one. In view of the different markets, NVIDIA won‚Äôt care about this, only the customer should really be sensitized.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review-ft-gigabyte-palit/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLjLrDYcY70)\n\n>**Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti**¬†is the latest in a long line of Blackwell GPUs to hit the market, arriving in both 8GB and 16GB flavours. I was only sent 16GB models for this review and it didn't sound like 8GB variants would be particularly prevalent at retail upon launch ‚Äì probably for the better considering a 8GB GPU launching at $379 sounds like madness to me.\n\n>But back to the 5060 Ti 16GB, it's a curious GPU that epitomises the term ‚Äòmixed-bag'. On the one hand, rasterisation performance is solid for 1080p and even 1440p gaming, though the latter resolution becomes more of a challenge if you stick to Ultra settings.\n\n>However, compared to the RTX 3060 Ti, we're only looking at a 31% uplift for 1080p rasterised gaming ‚Äì and that's a GPU which launched at the¬†[end of 2020,](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review/)¬†almost five years ago! It's clearly underwhelming and exemplifies the struggle for meaningful performance increases that this market segment has been crying out for.\n\n>That said, in the context of¬†*today's*¬†market, I don't think the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is a bad product. After all, it's still delivering circa 15% gains over its predecessor, the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, which actually sounds decent compared to some other Blackwell GPUs like the¬†[RTX 5070](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5070-review/), which is just 1-5% ahead of the RTX 4070 Super. As much as we may want larger generational gains, that's just not the reality for the 50 series given it remains on TSMC's 4N node, so I do think we need to be realistic with expectations.\n\n>It also helps that the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is launching with at the lower price point of ¬£399/$429. The 4060 Ti 16GB initially hit the market at ¬£479, though it did later drop below ¬£450, but even against that figure we're looking at an 11% price drop. There is of course a fair bit up in the air around PC hardware prices right now, but I do at least have¬†*some*¬†confidence that this price point will be achievable after seeing the RTX 5070 in stock at MSRP over the last couple of weeks. Heck, it's even been on sale for¬†[*less*¬†than MSRP](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/matthew-wilson/rtx-5070-drops-below-msrp-in-uk/), so we'd hope for more of the same this time around.\n\n>Of course, the RTX 3060 Ti comparison gets much more favourable when looking at ray tracing performance, largely thanks to having double the VRAM. 8GB cards these days just cannot deliver certain experiences when ray tracing is enabled, resulting in the 5060 Ti 16GB being multiple times faster in titles like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.\n\n>You could make the case that the RTX 5070 is the biggest threat to the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB ‚Äì it's readily in stock at MSRP, offers performance that's some 35-40% better depending on the game, and it's not¬†*too*¬†much more expensive, sitting at ¬£529. That said, it's priced high enough to still be out of reach for many, in which case the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB becomes the obvious choice around the ¬£400 mark ‚Äì for now, at least.\n\n>So no, it hasn't blown me away, and you can easily argue that the product itself is fairly underwhelming. But in this market segment, Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is our new go-to recommendation ‚Äì just don't get the 8GB model, please.\n\n>A final word on the two cards tested today.¬†**Palit's Infinity 3**¬†is a capable model, it's clearly built to hit the MSRP and as such is fairly light on features, but it runs quiet and cool, so I can't really complain.¬†**Gigabyte's**¬†**Aorus Elite**¬†is a much more premium offering, sporting RGB lighting, dual-BIOS and a metal backplate, while the cooler is more sophisticated, resulting in even lower thermals and noise levels than the Infinity 3. I don't have a confirmed price for it yet, but it's almost certainly going to come in¬†*well*¬†above MSRP, so as good as it is, be careful not to overpay as the 5070 could make more sense if the pricing creeps closer to ¬£500.\n\n# LanOC\n\n>TBD\n\n# PC World Article\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1xYjf3h_Q)\n\n>TBD\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-tuf-16-gb/)\n\n>For this launch we've updated our test setup again and retested all comparison cards with the newest drivers. We also updated the BIOS on our 9800X3D and added several new games, like our first RT exclusive title Indiana Jones, and Path Tracing is now an additional section in all reviews. At 1440p, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 13% performance uplift over the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB, which is quite small. At 4K, the increase is bigger, reaching 20%. A gen-over-gen improvement of 13% is not much, but at least it's more than RTX 5080 which only got 8% at 1440p. The RTX 5090, 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 did better, giving you an extra 20% at 1440p. Compared to the RTX 3060 Ti from two generations ago, the performance uplift is only 31%, usually we expect a doubling in performance over two generations. With these numbers the RTX 5060 Ti ends up a bit faster than AMD's aging Radeon RX 7700 XT, 11% behind the RX 7800 XT, which is much more expensive of course. NVIDIA's RTX 5070 non-Ti is a whopping 39% faster. The RTX 5060 Ti does not catch last generation's RTX 4070 either, which remains 16% ahead. If you've seen our manual overclocking results, there is a ton of headroom, like +15%, so I have no idea why NVIDIA clocked their card so low, especially considering the fact that it's underperforming by so much.\n\n>The RTX 5060 Ti is a fantastic choice for gaming at 1080p Full HD, especially with a high-refresh-rate monitor. It also has enough muscle for 1440p gaming in most games at maximum details. Some of the most demanding titles, or when RT is enabled will require you to use DLSS though to get a good gaming experience.\n\n>Thanks to its factory overclock, the ASUS TUF OC gains an extra 4% in real-life performance over the base RTX 5060 Ti, which is small, but every bit helps of course. Competing cards achieve similar performance levels, with all cards hitting +3% or +4.\n\n>Power consumption of the RTX 5060 Ti is good. While some other Blackwell cards had quite high power consumption in idle, multi-monitor and media playback, this isn't a problem at all here. The extra memory chips do increase the power draw slightly, but it's not enough to worry about. In gaming, I noticed that all models reach around 160 W without ray tracing, which is well below the default power limit of 180 W. However, when ray tracing is enabled, power usage increases and occasionally reaches the power limit‚Äîstill, the RTX 5060 Ti is definitely not power starved.\n\n# The FPS Review\n\n>TBD\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review)\n\n>Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti 16GB delivers a solid combination of performance for the suggested $429 base MSRP. However, as we've seen with every other GPU launch of the past five months, retail prices can be much higher. It's impossible to separate performance from pricing when looking at the overall value of a GPU, and the only thing concrete that we can point to are the MSRPs. Except those can run the gamut from being at least moderately accurate to being completely nonsense.\n\n>When the 4060 Ti 16GB came out a month after the 8GB variant, it felt severely underwhelming. Neither version was really designed to handle 4K gaming, but that was the only place where we measured a significant difference in performance. Two years later, things haven't changed¬†*too*¬†much, but the reduced $50 price gap (on paper at least) between the 5060 Ti 8GB and 16GB makes the 16GB a far easier recommendation. In fact, we'll go so far as to question why Nvidia even felt the need to create an 8GB version.\n\n>Yes, 8GB will be cheaper, and it will also be more limited due to the lack of VRAM. There are games (Indiana Jones and the Great Circle) where you can't even try to run ultra settings on an 8GB card. That's an Nvidia promoted game that simply crashes to desktop with a video memory error when you try higher settings on the 4060 and 4060 Ti 8GB GPUs, along with a bunch of other previous generation RTX cards.\n\n>The good news with the 16GB card is that memory bandwidth has improved thanks to GDDR7, so that it's not likely to hit VRAM capacity or bandwidth limitations. 56% more bandwidth than the 4060 Ti is a sizeable improvement. The fact that most games only show about 15% higher performance indicates that GPU compute is the limiting factor more than bandwidth, however.\n\n>But as we've already said numerous times, the price difference could very easily end up being more than $50. And factors like on again/off again tariffs, limited supply, product demand, and more could push the 16GB card to the point where maybe it won't be the better choice. The RTX 5070 still serves as a ceiling on how much more the 5060 Ti 16GB can realistically cost before it's \"too much,\" but with 5070 cards often listed for $700 or more, there's a lot of wiggle room right now.\n\n>Price and availability will be the key determiners of how good the 5060 Ti 16GB looks, and that will also vary by market. Europe and Asia might end up with a much different GPU landscape than the U.S. as far as graphics card values go.\n\n>What we can say is that the 5060 Ti 16GB isn't a massive generational improvement, but it¬†*is*¬†an improvement. It's also¬†*supposed*¬†to be less expensive than its 4060 Ti 16GB predecessor. Those are both good things, and stuff like neural rendering, DLSS 4, and Multi Frame Generation are merely extras that you can use as you see fit. Now we just wait to see what today's launch looks like, how quickly the 5060 Ti models sell out, and how high prices go.\n\n>Our score of 4-stars represents a \"best guess\" on what the 5060 Ti 16GB will look like in the current GPU market. Obviously, prices for all graphics cards, new and used, are all over the map. If the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB costs 50% more than the MSRP, and other cards¬†*don't*¬†show a similar markup, that makes it a worse value and a less desirable card and it would deserve a lower score. We can't predict where things will go, so pay more attention to the performance and real-world pricing than the single score that we've assigned, because uncontrollable factors play into the overall package.\n\n# [Computerbase - German](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-test.92119/)\n\n# [HardwareLuxx - German](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65938-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-mit-16-gb-im-test.html)\n\n# [PCGH - German](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5060-Ti-16GB-Grafikkarte-281131/Tests/Release-Review-Preis-kaufen-Benchmark-Specs-1470373/)\n\n# [Elchapuzasinformatico - Spanish](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2025/04/msi-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-gaming-trio-oc-review/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n# Video Review\n\n# [Der8auer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ5HOxQFKkg&pp=ygUIZGVyYmF1ZXI%3D)\n\n# Digital Foundry Video\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR5phLkePYA)\n\n# [Gamers Nexus Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cskegn1-D7s)\n\n# [Hardware Canucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltc1Lzjfp-c)\n\n# [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6qZwJsp5X4)\n\n# [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBVLnN5UGvk)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLjLrDYcY70)\n\n# [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMOqQS7ItXE)\n\n# Linus Tech Tips\n\n# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R2eGg4wRvk)\n\n# Optimum Tech\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1xYjf3h_Q)\n\n# [Techtesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGBkWeGyUc4)\n\n# Tech Yes City",

I will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links. This will be sorted alphabetically.\n\n# Written Articles\n\n# [Babeltechreviews](https://babeltechreviews.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-the-most-underwhelming-gpu-of-the-generation/)\n\n>The RTX 5070 is a solid GPU, but it doesn‚Äôt justify its price. Nvidia expects DLSS 4 to carry the product, but that‚Äôs not enough when raw performance gains are minimal. Don‚Äôt underestimate this value, of course, as it‚Äôs a monumental uplift in the games that support it and create a significantly improved experience at this time. It is clear that generation-over-generation gains for raw performance are minimal, and the return on investment is not worthy of an immediate upgrade need for those with the 40 series. However, for gamers using a 3070 or older, this is a worthwhile upgrade\n\n>Final Verdict: If you can find the RTX 5070 at MSRP ($549), it‚Äôs a fine midrange card, but if prices push toward $600-700+, it makes absolutely no sense to buy it. The MSRP is a sweet spot; we hope stock is in place.  \n  \nYou‚Äôre also likely to be better off grabbing a discounted RTX 4070 Super, an RTX 4080, or an AMD 7900 GRE if stock is not here at launch. DLSS 4 is neat, but it‚Äôs not enough.\n\n>Skip it unless you get MSRP pricing at this time, or you are a couple of generations behind and want the latest in the class. Happy Gaming!\n\n# [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review)\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nldUI2yQomw)\n\n>The RTX 5070 is an interestingly-placed card, in that it technically represents an improvement over the RTX 4070 Super - marginally faster overall, with DLSS 4, and at a lower price than its predecessor. That puts it at the very top of our dollar per frame stakes, judged versus MSRP and therefore that initial value proposition.\n\n>However, in the real world where the RTX 4070 Super will be (sparingly) available for less money, the argument here is relatively meagre. There are performance¬†*regressions*¬†versus the 4070 Super in a handful of games, frame generation requires more judicious settings choices to ensure playable latency, and of course we can't forget that AMD's RX 9070 and 9070 XT are set to arrive very soon indeed - with potentially much greater price to performance ratios.\n\n>If you're on something like an RTX 3080, RTX 3080 Ti, RTX 3090, RX 7900 XT or RTX 4070 Ti, you're already pretty familiar with the level of performance on offer and there's no huge reason to upgrade - unless you particularly value frame generation or multi frame generation to max out a high refresh rate monitor, for example. Instead, it'll be those on RTX 20-series cards that have more of an impetus, and for these people the new Radeon cards should also be worth considering.\n\n>There's also the VRAM argument. 12GB is still good enough for almost all modern titles, but it's easy to feel short-changed when 16GB cards have been available for some time at relatively modest asking prices - albeit largely from AMD rather than Nvidia. The RX 7800 XT, for example, is a 16GB card that takes the number four slot in our 1440p value deliberations (visible in the table below).\n\n>The one way that the RTX 5070 does impress over its previous-gen predecessors is in the Founders Edition reference design, which like the other members of the RTX 50-series family comes in a very reasonable form factor, operates cooly and quietly and looks good too. No doubt relatively few will be available versus third-party designs, but there should still be some good SFF-friendly options within that selection.\n\n# [eTeknix Article](https://www.eteknix.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-founders-edition-graphics-card-review/)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuwmOMxiNuA)\n\n>So, after looking through all the benchmarks, ray tracing performance, upscaling capabilities, and everything else in between, it‚Äôs clear that the RTX 5070 has its strengths but also a fair share of problems. For those still holding onto an RTX 3070, the jump to the 5070 does offer some worthwhile gains, particularly in ray tracing performance, but even then, the increases aren‚Äôt as impressive as what gamers were hoping for. The reality is, expectations were higher, and while a 50‚Äì100% uplift in ray tracing sounds decent, it still feels like we‚Äôre only just scraping by in terms of what a next-gen upgrade should deliver.\n\n>The real issue here is that NVIDIA seems to be hedging all their bets on DLSS 4 and multi-frame generation to carry the 50 series forward. While the technology is impressive in terms of boosting performance and reducing latency, the fact that it only works in supported titles leaves a lot of gamers in a bit of a limbo. For those who aren‚Äôt planning on enabling DLSS 4 for every game, the generational uplift over the 4070 and 4070 SUPER feels almost non-existent and that‚Äôs a similar story with rasterisation too, which as we know, is starting to see smaller gains, but in the case of the RTX 5070, sometimes it didn‚Äôt gain much at all. The 4070 SUPER in particular is proving to be a thorn in the side of the 5070, offering similar or better performance in several titles despite being last-gen and that makes the 5070 feel like an RTX 4070 SUPER SUPER.\n\n>In the end, the RTX 5070 feels like an ok upgrade for those moving from an RTX 3070, but a tough sell for anyone else and even then, it‚Äôs not exactly mind-blowing. The gains are there, but they‚Äôre just not substantial enough to justify the asking price unless DLSS 4 is a must-have feature for you. NVIDIA needs to sort out the 1% lows and address pricing quickly too, or the 5070 risks being overshadowed not just by AMD‚Äôs new cards but by NVIDIA‚Äôs own last-gen offerings as well, and that‚Äôs the state of the RTX 5070. Let me know in the comments if you think DLSS 4 is enough to save it or if AMD‚Äôs 9000 series has your attention.\n\n# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/geforce-rtx-5070-founders-edition-review/)\n\n>The RTX 5070 is built around an rasterizer engine and includes around 6,000 CUDA cores. It stems from the RTX 50 series, which introduces a new generation of Ray Tracing and Tensor cores positioned close to the shader engine. These RT cores never pause as they produce vivid lighting, shadow, and reflection effects. Although Tensor cores sometimes seem tricky to measure in terms of raw benefits, their influence becomes obvious when paired with DLSS3 and the updated DLSS4.¬†The 50 series represents more than a mere upgrade; it stands as a leap forward that meets different gaming requirements. Whether someone is immersed in 2K (2560x1440) gaming or venturing into the realm of 4K (3840x2160), the RTX 5070 adapts. At each resolution, it showcases impressive frame rates and a solid improvement in visual detail. However, it still sits slightly behind in standardized shading when compared to a few of its closest competitors. Depending on the specific game, performance gains might vary wildly. One title may see dramatic jumps in frames per second, while another experiences a more modest bump. Yet the real hook for many gamers remains NVIDIA's significant focus on artificial intelligence, deep learning, and neural shading.¬†\n\n>When you activate DLSS4 with frame generation configured at a 4x setting, the difference is immediately noticeable. It feels like a sneak peek into the future of gaming. The question that lingers, though, is whether the community will be quick to invest in these AI-driven features. In a world where technology changes practically overnight, some might hesitate to rely so heavily on machine learning for improved performance and visuals. Others, especially the early adopters, see no reason to hold back. Given enough time, it seems likely that more players will jump on board, especially once they see the potential it unlocks in modern titles.¬†There is no denying that DLSS4 works wonders. Early performance data backs this up, showing how the feature can transform an already impressive game into an absolutely stunning one. Gamers who prioritize ultra-wide displays or 1440p monitors notice an especially pronounced advantage, as every pixel is pushed to its limit. Meanwhile, those looking to push 4K to new heights will also find a lot to appreciate. By balancing the raw power of the 5070 with the dynamic upscaling techniques offered by DLSS4, titles can soar past frame rate ceilings that used to be considered unreachable.¬†Some might see the RTX 5070 as primarily a mainstream-level card, but it aims to break that mould by catering to a variety of gaming niches. Not everyone needs to crank every setting up to maximum, yet many still desire a card that can handle demanding AAA titles and sustain smooth performance. The 5070 steps up to that challenge without much fuss. It also fits well into systems built for content creators or professionals who rely on GPU acceleration for tasks like video editing and 3D rendering. The additional horsepower in CUDA cores can shave minutes off render times, freeing up creators to do more in less time.\n\n>True gurus, of course, might already be eyeing the higher-tier 5070 Ti or 5080. But the 5070 lands at a spot that feels balanced for the majority of gamers. It is neither an entry-level solution nor is it priced so high that only a select few can justify it. As more developers implement advanced lighting and AI-enhanced techniques, the demands on hardware will continue to climb. By having a card like the 5070, players gain a buffer against those ever-increasing requirements.\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5070 strikes a more fair balance between performance, efficiency, and perhaps cost. Its specs, including 6,144 shading units, 192 Tensor Cores, and 48 RT Cores, reveal a GPU built to handle both high FPS gaming and professional workloads like 3D rendering. Thanks to its 12 GB of GDDR7 memory on a 192-bit bus, it provides enough bandwidth (672 GB/s) to keep pace with modern game engines, high-resolution textures, and intensive AI tasks. 16GB however would have been the better path to follow. Up-to 2560x1440 you should be fine though.¬†Boost clock speeds that reach around 2,510 MHz give it solid headroom for intensive sessions, while the \\~250 W power draw and single 16-pin connector keep installation and thermal considerations manageable. There's also a little left for tweaking some more perf out of the card.¬†In benchmarks or real-world usage, the RTX 5070‚Äôs raw data excels in 1440p gaming, with support for DirectX 12 Ultimate features like ray tracing and variable rate shading. On top of that, the large 40 MB L2 cache helps minimize latency during demanding processes, and the presence of Tensor Cores brings additional gains in workflows like AI-based upscaling or neural network applications. Direct competitors are the RTX 4070 Ti, RTX 3090 and from team red the 7800XT.¬†If you are in the market for a card in this price range, you should wait and learn more (tomorrow) to see if the Radeon RX 9070 (XT) is competitive enough in price and performance with the 5070 models.¬†Considering its $549 launch price and the gains from the 5nm manufacturing process, the RTX 5070 caters to gamers, content creators, and pretty much anyone looking for a well-rounded card that can fit into a variety of system configurations. It supports HDMI 2.1b and DisplayPort 2.1a outputs, which provides enough flexibility for multi-monitor setups or single high-refresh displays. Overall, the RTX 5070 targets an audience seeking an acceptable feature set and likeable performance without venturing into the extreme power and price tiers of the higher-end 50 series models, we just feel this card is late to the market. The founder edition card looks fantastic, but cools moderately alongside being a bit on the noisy side,¬† if board partners keep prices under control at that $549,- price level then they might have a better alternative to offer compared to the founders reference design.\n\n# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-fe-review-and-benchmarks)\n\n>At this point, anyone paying attention to the consumer GPU market should know what NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5070 FE is all about. Like the other members of the¬†[GeForce RTX 50 series](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-architecture-overview), the GeForce RTX 5070 FE offers a modest upgrade in rasterization performance over the previous-gen GeForce RTX 4070, though it's a much larger upgrade for gamers that are still rocking a¬†[GeForce RTX 3070 Ti](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-and-benchmarks)¬†or lower-end RTX 30 series card. If you factor in creator workloads, ray tracing, or the potential upsides of DLSS 4, however, the GeForce RTX 5070 FE‚Äôs value proposition looks a bit better. If you‚Äôre running a GeForce RTX 40 series card though, the GeForce RTX 5070 FE may not be compelling enough for current owners of an RTX 4070 or lower. The launch of this card is also happening while AMD‚Äôs newest RDNA 4-based Radeon 9070s loom, which will play in the same price bracket, so waiting to see how those cards shape-up versus the RTX 5070 is also advisable.\n\n>In the end, the GeForce RTX 5070 FE assumes a similar profile as the other, higher-end GeForce RTX 50 series cards. It‚Äôs faster, more capable, and more power-efficient than its previous generation counterpart. However, without leveraging DLSS 4‚Äôs multi frame generation, its generational performance uplift is smaller than what we‚Äôve historically seen from NVIDIA.\n\n# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-founders-edition-test-when-the-ki-has-to-help-out/)\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5070 only offers a minimal increase in performance compared to the GeForce RTX 4070 Super in classic raster graphics applications. The performance increase is only 2.5% in Full HD and around 2.6% in WQHD. A noticeable advantage is only achieved through the use of AI-supported technologies such as DLSS 4. In games that make optimal use of DLSS, the RTX 5070 can offer up to 10% higher performance on average (or significantly higher depending on the title with DLSS4). However, these advantages are not based on pure hardware performance, but on algorithmic optimization. In native Ultra HD resolution, on the other hand, the card falls short of expectations due to the limited VRAM and memory bandwidth and should not be used without supersampling.\n\n>This paradigm shift is particularly evident in games such as Cyberpunk 2077 or Alan Wake 2, which benefit massively from DLSS 4. Without AI support, the increase in performance compared to the RTX 4070 Super remains marginal. The RTX 5070 thus shows that NVIDIA is increasingly focusing on AI-supported rendering techniques to increase perceived performance instead of significantly increasing the raw performance of the hardware. But I already wrote a few lines explaining this in the introduction.\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5070 is a graphics card that relies heavily on NVIDIA‚Äôs current strategy: instead of a significant increase in classic raster performance, performance is mainly improved by AI-supported features such as DLSS 4. In native resolutions without upscaling, the performance increase compared to the RTX 4070 Super remains low, while there is a clear advantage in optimized games. The cooling solution of the Founders Edition works functionally, but quickly reaches its thermal limit, whereby the clock behavior changes after a few minutes under load. The volume of the card is high, which makes it difficult to use in quiet systems. In addition, problems with PCIe 5.0 can occur, which can lead to instability in certain system configurations.\n\n>The recommended retail price (RRP) of the GeForce RTX 5070 is 649 euros. In view of the only marginal increase in performance compared to the RTX 4070 Super, the question arises as to the actual added value of this card if you are not obsessed with DLSS4. The pricing does not seem quite optimal, especially in view of the limited native performance and the strong dependence on DLSS 4, even though the RRP is even 10 euros below the issue price of the GeForce RTX 4070 at the time.\n\n>While better performance is achieved in AI-optimized games, users who prefer classic raster graphics will hardly benefit from the new generation and will no longer be able to play games that still rely on older PhysX libraries. The RTX 5070 also competes with models from the previous generation, some of which are (still) available at lower prices, as well as with AMD alternatives, which offer better price-performance in some scenarios. For buyers looking for a GPU with long-term future security, the limited VRAM configuration of 12 GB could also be a relevant factor.\n\n>Ultimately, the RTX 5070 remains a GPU that relies heavily on software support and the user profile below Ultra HD. Those who are willing to engage in AI-supported optimizations will certainly get solid cards with modern architecture from the board partners. However, users who primarily rely on native raster performance or want to play an older game will hardly notice any advantages over the previous generation. Of course, it is always better than an RTX 3070, but anything above that will probably be a pure side-grade for most people.\n\n# [KitGuru Article](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-5070-review/)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg9T-_mOMhs)\n\n>It was also fascinating to take a closer look at performance compared against the RTX 4090 as part of this review. After all, that was the claim made by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, but it did not hold up to any real scrutiny in my testing today. For one, we've already established that the 5070 is no faster than the 4070 Super when it comes to native rendering performance, so it's certainly not matching the RTX 4090 there ‚Äì in fact it's some 40-50% slower depending on the game.\n\n>Nvidia was of course referring to DLSS 4, and specifically Multi Frame Generation (MFG) as the basis for this claim, and in my testing there are examples where the RTX 5070, using MFG 4X, can deliver a similar frame rate to the RTX 4090, with that GPU limited to ‚Äòstandard' Frame Gen. Even then, that does not equate to the same¬†*performance*, as latency was always higher on the 5070, sometimes by up to twice as much, given the 5070 has a much lower base frame rate ‚Äì and that's not even mentioning the image quality implications, given the 5070 would be displaying twice as many AI-generated frames versus the 4090 in these scenarios.\n\n>During this testing we also found a handful of examples where the RTX 5070 was bottlenecked by its 12GB framebuffer. In the likes of Indiana Jones, Spider-Man 2, and Ratchet and Clank, the GPU ground to halt as it had insufficient video memory, and often times it was Frame Generation that pushed it over the edge. To be clear, 12GB VRAM is enough for the vast majority of games I tested today, but we are already starting to see games pushing that limit, especially with ray tracing and frame generation enabled. And if that's the case today, things certainly aren't going to get better down the line.\n\n>Ultimately, having reflected on the RTX 5070 over the past few days, I am struggling to see a clear reason as to why this GPU might be a compelling purchase. After all, if you held off buying a 4070 Super, even when it dropped below MSRP¬†[throughout 2024](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/y6dG3C/msi-ventus-2x-oc-geforce-rtx-4070-super-12-gb-video-card-rtx-4070-super-12g-ventus-2x-oc?history_days=365), will the RTX 5070 really persuade you otherwise, given it is offering the same performance and the same amount of VRAM? Yes, there is the addition of MFG, some marginal efficiency improvements, and a slightly lower price, so it's not like it's¬†*worse*¬†‚Äì but we can't shake the feeling that the RTX 5070 is a thoroughly unambitious GPU, content with doing the bare minimum and hoping that's enough to scrape by.\n\n# [LanOC](https://lanoc.org/review/video-cards/nvidia-rtx-5070-founders-edition)\n\n>For performance, you can expect to be able to throw anything at it at 1080p or 1440p. Even at 4k, everything in our test suite was still playable, but with just 12GB of VRAM, it did drop in performance. In some of my DLSS testing where I cranked ray tracing completely up on the latest games, it couldn‚Äôt handle 4k at all. Beyond that situation though, DLSS 4 was especially impressive giving at times up to a 550% increase in performance to turn good performance into a frame rate you would want to use a high refresh rate display on. I spoke about it in the other 50 Series reviews, but DLSS 4 hasn‚Äôt just increased frame rates, it is smoother and looks a lot better. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it has reached the point where all but the pickiest person isn‚Äôt going to have an issue with it. When it comes to in-game performance the RTX 5070 Founders Edition traded blows with the overclocked RTX 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti SUPER but when it came to our averaged numbers it was out in front of the RTX 4070 Ti by a small margin when not figuring in our tests with multi frame generation. It outperformed the Radeon RX 7800 XT by a large margin and offered an improvement of 75% when compared to the RTX 3070 which is the most likely upgrade path to the 5070. The Founders Edition cooler did end up running warmer than the other cards tested, the more compact design didn‚Äôt overheat at all but isn‚Äôt leaving a lot of headroom either. That said it was quieter at 100% than I would have expected considering it had its fans running faster than any of the other cards tested.\n\n>As always, it will all come down to pricing. There aren‚Äôt bad cards, only bad pricing. The RTX 5070 Founders Edition has an MSRP of $549 which is the base MSRP of the RTX 5070 in general. But keep in mind, as we have seen with just about every launch for the last 4+ generations demand is always higher than supply, and with that pricing starts to go out of the window. Not only that but when cards come back in stock, it's normally the more expensive overclocked models. With that in mind, I did put together a chart that breaks down performance with MSRP and current pricing. With demand going crazy and tariff-fueled pricing you can see most of the cards have a big difference between their MSRP and actual pricing. All prices were pulled from the lowest price on PCPartPicker. Overall AMD is dominating the top of the chart but if you can get the RTX 5070 at or near the MSRP it will be a good pickup. The best comparison is with the RX 7800 XT which is selling for as low as $529 and as we saw the RTX 5070 outperformed it handedly. The RTX 5070 would be a better buy as long as you can get it for less than $610.\n\n# [PC World Article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2625579/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review.html)\n\n>If you‚Äôre coming from an RTX 3070 ‚Äì or anything older or weaker ‚Äì the RTX 5070 will be a tangible upgrade. You‚Äôll feel the leap forward in performance, and the extra memory capacity. Even though the RTX 5070‚Äôs mere 12GB of memory disappoints in a $500+ graphics card in 2025, the older RTX 3070 only had 8GB, and that can feel¬†*awfully*¬†tight at 1440p resolution. The RTX 3070 already needs to make visual compromises to meet the memory demands of many modern games.\n\n>The RTX 5070 doesn‚Äôt, though the 12GB capacity is nowhere near as future-proof as the 16GB found on virtually all other graphics cards in this price range. The limited capacity means you won‚Äôt want this GPU for 4K gaming.\n\n>While the RTX 5070 is one of the worst generational GPU ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù in memory, it‚Äôs still a very good 1440p graphics card. Performance soars over 100fps in many games even with graphics settings cranked to the max, and crosses 60fps even in our most strenuous tests with ray tracing enabled. That gives the RTX 5070 enough firepower to flip on DLSS 4‚Äôs jaw-dropping Multi-Frame Gen tech, which unlocks new levels of visual smoothness that must be seen to believed. It‚Äôs available in 75+ games.\n\n>If you don‚Äôt plan on utilizing DLSS 4, well, you‚Äôre truly missing out. It‚Äôs great. But the RTX 5070 loses a lot of its luster when it‚Äôs not churning out AI frames. In non-DLSS games, the RTX 4070 Super has offered identical performance levels for over a year now.\n\n>Bottom line? Nvidia‚Äôs GeForce RTX 5070 is a stagnant ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù from a hardware point of view, and it‚Äôs skimpy with RAM considering the price. But yes, DLSS 4 software gives the RTX 5070 superpowers otherwise unachievable ‚Äì at least in the games that actively support it. I‚Äôm deeply disappointed that Nvidia didn‚Äôt move the needle in performance or memory capacity, and barely nudged the price down in return. But this is nonetheless a good 1440p graphics card.\n\n>Given the stagnation, and given that AMD‚Äôs Radeon RX 9070 launches just a day after the RTX 5070 but with 16GB of memory, I‚Äôd strongly suggest waiting for reviews of that graphics card before making a purchase. Weigh all your options before plunking down your $550.\n\n# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-founders-edition/)\n\n>We upgraded our test system in preparation for this wave of GPU launches, which is now built on AMD technology with the outstanding Ryzen 7 9800X3D. We've updated to Windows 11 24H2, complete with the newest patches and updates, and have added a selection of new games. At 1440p, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 22% performance uplift over the RTX 4070, which is a bit lower than expected, but alright I'd say. At 4K, the increase is 25%, which is certainly better than the meager 15% that we got on RTX 5080, the RTX 5090 got +36%, and the RTX 5070 Ti was 27% faster. Just like on the RTX 5080, NVIDIA is unable to achieve their \"twice the performance every second generation\" rule with the RTX 5070, which is only 59% faster at 4K, 56% at 1440p. Overall performance is roughly similar to the RTX 4070 Ti, 10% behind the RTX 4070 Ti Super. Compared to the RTX 4070 Super the performance uplift is 5%. When compared against AMD's offerings, the 5070 sits roughly in the middle between RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 GRE. AMD's own performance projections see the RX 9070 XT a bit slower than the RTX 5070 Ti, which means it should beat the RX 5070, at least in pure raster. The RX 9070 non-XT should end up at roughly similar performance the RTX 5070, which means competition will be fierce in this segment (hopefully).\n\n>While the RTX 5070 is definitely a great card for 1440p, it's a little bit weak for 4K gaming without upscaling, that's why we recommend the card for a resolution of 1440p, especially when you consider that future games will have higher hardware requirements.\n\n>NVIDIA is betting on ray tracing and Blackwell comes with several improvements here. Interestingly, when comparing RTX 4070 with the RTX 5070, the performance gain with RT is smaller than with raster: +15% vs +22% at 1440p. We saw RTX 5070 trading blows with 4070 Ti in raster, with RT it's clearly behind and is only able to match RTX 4070 Super. Still, RT performance is good, it's faster than AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Whether it will be faster than the upcoming RX 9070 Series remains to be seen. AMD has given their RT cores some extra love with RDNA 4. With Blackwell, NVIDIA is introducing several new technologies. The most interesting one is Neural Rendering, which is exposed through a Microsoft DirectX API (Cooperative Vectors). This ensures that the feature is universally available for all GPU vendors to implement, so game developers should be highly motivated to pick it up.\n\n>NVIDIA's MSRP for the RTX 5070 is set at $550, which is very reasonable for what's offered. Actually that price is $50 lower than the MSRP of the RTX 4070, which launched at $600. If you've followed the tech news in recent weeks, then you'll sure be aware of all the drama surrounding the MSRP. Right now not a single GeForce 50 card is in stock anywhere in the world, and scalpers are selling them at hugely inflated pricing. Custom designs from the various board partners are 20%, 30%, 40% more expensive than the baseline price just for some bigger coolers and RGB bling. Another annoyance is that AICs are introducing cards at the baseline price in minimal numbers, which quickly sell out, with no plans to replenish at that price, and suggesting that customers opt for the $100 more expensive version. I'm not sure why the MSRPs need to be faked? Just to build hype, get some positive reviews and disappoint customers when they want to buy the product? If supply is so low, why is NVIDIA even launching so many products in just a few weeks? Hopefully AMD does better tomorrow, but their pricing seems suspiciously low, too.\n\n>At $550, there aren't many alternatives to the RTX 5070. The closest option is the Radeon RX 7900 GRE for $530. It's slightly slower in raster, much slower in RT and draws a bit more power. The RTX 4070 Ti sells for $750, offering a little bit higher RT performance, but without multi-frame-generation. RTX 4070 Ti Super is much more interesting, because it offers 16 GB VRAM with significantly higher overall performance, but it's $800. If ray tracing or upscaling isn't your top priority, and you want to focus on pure raster performance, then Radeon RX 7900 XT could be an option, for $640. Due to DLSS 3 and DLSS 4, the better choice for most gamers will still be the RTX 5070.\n\n# [The FPS Review](https://www.thefpsreview.com/2025/03/04/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-founders-edition-video-card-review/)\n\n>Based on our performance, our summary is that in Raster Performance, the new GeForce RTX 5070 is on par, or even slightly less, the performance of the GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER, in Ray Tracing performance the GeForce RTX 5070 is a regression in performance compared to the GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER, and in Compute Performance the GeForce RTX 5070 is faster than the GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER.\n\n>Those upgrading from the GeForce RTX 30 series or less will find a bigger impact moving up to the GeForce RTX 5070 in the experience. The number of games where the RTX 5070 had an uplift over the RTX 4070 SUPER was less than the ones where it was on par in our gaming suite. The GeForce RTX 5070 also uses more power than the GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER to only provide equal or lesser performance, except in some specific gaming scenarios where compute is more utilized.\n\n>Raytracing and Raster performance are a bit stagnant, even regressing slightly. In all previous generations since the RTX 20 series, RT performance has improved; it seems like this is the first generation that it has not in this price range. It also seems that raster performance has stagnated here or even regressed in some games, yet in some outliers like Cyberpunk 2077, the uplift was larger. The range is quite wide here in terms of performance; depending on the game, the average experience was on par compared to the GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER.\n\n>The 12GB of VRAM capacity on the GeForce RTX 5070 is stagnation in this price range, with no movement or progress. The industry is not being moved forward for gamers, and the gameplay experience is not being moved forward for gamers at this price range in this generation. It could hinder game development for an enjoyable gameplay experience in future game titles. It is clear that in 2025 and moving forward, and for the life of this video card, at this price range, 16GB of VRAM is preferred.\n\n>In summary, the GeForce RTX 5070 is a GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER with on par, or sometimes slightly less raster performance, slightly less ray tracing performance, but faster compute performance, and a higher power demand. On the plus side, at least our GeForce RTX 5070 Founders Edition has all its ROPs.\n\n# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review-founders-edition)\n\n>Looking just at performance, the RTX 5070 Founders Edition, and by extension the RTX 5070 in general, offer a decent step up from the prior generation. It's not the \"nearly twice the performance\" marketing that Nvidia claims, as that requires the use of MFG4X along with some seriously tinted goggles to make you believe that AI-generated frames are the same as rendered frames. But it's a solid 20% improvement, ostensibly at the same price as the outgoing 4070. And in certain workloads ‚Äî like with MFG or in AI tasks that can leverage the FP4 support ‚Äî it can deliver sizable gains.\n\n>If you could buy the 5070 for $549 right now, that would be a great deal. The cards go on sale on March 5 (tomorrow), and we'd bet heavily they'll sell out almost instantly. And based on what we're seeing from the 5090, 5080, and 5070 Ti, not to mention all of the sold-out prior generation GPUs, we have to believe the supply will remain constrained for a long time ‚Äî possibly throughout 2025, though we really hope we're wrong on that front.\n\n>With the current market conditions, how do we even score reviews like this? That's the dilemma we face. Nvidia says the price should start at $549, but we all know that's not going to happen. So consider the 4-star score as \"this is what we'd give the card if you could buy it for $549, right now.\" No, you almost certainly can't buy one tomorrow for that price, but we're not sure what to score something that will inevitably sell out. When demand is so much higher than the expected supply, it hardly matters what we score it. If you see a 5070 for $899 tomorrow, that's a completely different graphics card than what we reviewed and would be scored lower... but we have no way of knowing how prices will evolve over time.\n\n>If the RTX 5070 is available at its MSRP, it's a modest generational upgrade that we would happily recommend. That's about the best we can say or hope for. We'll discuss tomorrow how it stacks up against AMD's RX 9070 that has the same $549 MSRP. In normal times, there would be heated debates about which one is better, whether DLSS beats FSR, and if AMD or Nvidia makes better drivers. The winner this round, however, is going to be the company that produces more GPUs to sell to consumers.\n\n# [Computerbase - German](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-test.91530/)\n\n# [HardwareLuxx - German](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/grafikkarten/65584-sparsam-aber-nur-knapp-voraus-founders-edition-und-asus-prime-der-geforce-rtx-5070-im-test.html)\n\n# [PCGH - German](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-5070-Grafikkarte-281032/Tests/Preis-Release-Test-RTX-5070-Ti-vs-5070-1467175/)\n\n# [Elchapuzasinformatico - Spanish](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2025/03/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-founders-edition-review/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n# Video Review\n\n# Der8auer\n\n# [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nldUI2yQomw)\n\n# [eTeknix Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuwmOMxiNuA)\n\n# [Gamers Nexus Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntSylZ1Bp1Y)\n\n# [Hardware Canucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REBq2PoAkBc)\n\n# [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPGDVh_cQb0)\n\n# [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxvmfEZkvc8)\n\n# [KitGuru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg9T-_mOMhs)\n\n# [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geRt3ZlQw8o)\n\n# [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUaztYdgoj0)\n\n# OC3D Video\n\n# Optimum Tech\n\n# [PC World Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxSVkCEKAu0)\n\n# Techtesters\n\n# Tech Yes City",

No sane person would buy it for gaming, for that price you can get a decent 5080 which is consistently faster.",

At the risk of speaking to an echo chamber (this *is* the NVIDIA subreddit, after all): should I really be worried? I wanted a gigantic leap from a near-decade year old beast, and four generations later seemed to be a great time to do just that.\n\n(note: haven't even received the card yet, it's coming a week from now)\n\nEdit: I haven't replied to anyone directly (writing is exhausting for me, and this amount of replies is overwhelming), but I'd like to thank everyone for their input. Some say I've made a mistake getting a card that only has 1gb more vram than the 8 year old card I've held on to, and they might be right. I just don't have the budget to spend the extra cash for the Ti version. It might come back to bite me significantly sooner than my 1080ti's lasted, but that's unfortunately the trade-off I have to live with.\n\nI feel a lot more comfortable just seeing how things play out once I get the build running now.

But almost every issue you see on reddit is from someone who feels betrayed, and that is a powerful impetus to be extra vocal, to find a vocal community who share that minority experience. Which is understandable. But Reddit isn‚Äôt a true consensus. It is, as you say, an echo chamber that leans more toward the purpose of troubleshooting and/or grievance airing for people who want the catharsis of being heard after feeling like a big investment has gone wrong. Generalisations run rampant and create this false expectation of catastrophe. It‚Äôs pandemic across all subs, not just this one. \n\nIt defaults as a bad news forum. \n\nI guarantee you the overwhelming majority of 50 series owners are silently enjoying their cards and that will, I‚Äôm sure, include you.",
      "Having gone from 1080ti to 4070 super which is nearly the same upgrade you made, here's my experience.\n\nSuper happy with DLSS upscaling, DLSS framegen is sometimes nice depending on the game. especially with the new model i tend to aim for 4k120 gameplay and the first thing i do is pop DLSS to performance mode and usually that will do the trick. 1080ti had me struggling for 4k60 on low settings near the end there.\n\nFramegen is very nice on some games but not others, just feel it out a bit and see if you like it.\n\nDownside: Vram is a bit limited. some games i will pop textures from ultra down to high. This is actually not a huge sacrifice and saves a ton of Vram, but still sad that you have to. You can play around with path tracing a bit to nerd out but probably don't want to play full games with it on.\n\nTL;DR, Super happy with the upgrade, wish nvidia was less stingy on Vram but it's not as bad as it seems.",

It is horrid value above MSRP where nvidia cards tend to end up.¬†\n3. The 90 series is superior value at MSRP.¬†\n\n\nI find none of these ended out being true, and influencers just ride the hype.¬†\n\n1. It is not a good generational leap, but there is some benefit in lower wattage\n2. It ended up going below MSRP, but now review videos are set with the wrong sentiment and people parrot it back.¬†\n3. 90 series MSRP ended up being a fake marketing stunt that worked really well.¬†\n\nThe 5070 is an ok card at or below MSRP. It is not an amazing leap, but you get what you pay for, and to get more, you‚Äôd need to pay more.

Unfortunately the RX 9070 XT is $200 more in Canada and often not available at MSRP. I've invested the difference in a better CPU and more RAM.\n\n\nTech YouTubers and reviewers are making money by clickbait videos about how terrible a product is. Granted the RTX 5070 should've had 16 GB VRAM and the gains compared to the RTX 4070S are nearly non existent. In my opinion the RTX 5070 is a good mid-range GPU designed for 1440P for people coming from RTX 3xxx series or older. This card is not for your annual GPU update. At MSRP this card is right now decent value. It depends on your location but in Canada all other cards are so much more expensive that budget gamers have few options and for me the 5070 was the only sub $1000 card available.\n\n\nI'm now playing all latest games with 120+ FPS on 1440P¬† maxed out. Framgen is a good feature and comes especially handy in titles that are poorly optimized like Oblivion Remastered.",

Based on raw power and not their misleading \"AI TOPS\" I was only looking at the 5070 TI as a minimum. But remember, all these reviews and a lot of opinions are based on assessing this stuff annually. You will see a significant improvement jumping across 4 generations with your upgrade.",
      "The VRAM is overblown IMO‚Ä¶ there might be 2-3 games today that use up 12GB with ultra settings at 4K.  If you use DLSS and upscale it will be less of an issue, and gaming at higher resolutions than 4K isn‚Äôt going to be a thing for awhile.\n\nI have a 5070 Ti with 16GB of VRAM and most modern games I play don‚Äôt even use more than 8 GB on Ultra 5120x1440p for me.

      "Not really, most new releases use 6-8GB of VRAM at 1440p with everything maxed at ultra, ray tracing, and path tracing on. At 4K native you might see 12GB-13GB if you do the same.  \n\nIf you‚Äôre a graphics snob and must play at 4K native with Ray tracing and path tracing on, then sure get a 5090 then\n\nIf you use DLSS, 12GB is fine for everything.",
      "The people in this Forum are for sure in a cult. I knew when I posted and gave OP my honest opinion I would get downvoted. The 5070 is 2.26X more powerful than the 3060 with the same amount of VRAM. The 5070 is supposed to be a mid level card. We can go back a few generations, the 1070 having 8GB of VRAM was sufficient. 2070& 3070 having 8GB was not. The 5070 is 3x as powerful as the 1070 but with only 50% more Vram‚Ä¶. Straight blasphemy.",
      "You will have a great time with the card and if you‚Äôre interested in playing the latest graphically demanding games then as long as you‚Äôre turning on DLSS and FG you should be able to do so. \n\nThe one negative of your upgrade path is the reduced VRAM compared to other 70 class products. This may hamper you in some of the current games from playing at absolute Max settings and possibly future games. But by turning down a few settings the card will still be an awesome upgrade for you.",
      "It's a great card, had mine for about 3 weeks and upgraded from a 2080ti. I can play games like Oblivion remastered at ultra (with a little help from frame gen and DLSS). \n\nPeople will often bang on about the vram size but at 1440p it should be no issue, I've not seen it go over 10gb yet and played games like Stalker 2 and Oblivion remastered."

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/196aeo2b53ge1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=da05b4e9b4b1a53b38488c81e9fee744ee2baa4b\n\n\\*Note to everyone - this is a post in progress as I'm rushing to get the most important details for those of you planning your day tomorrow (edit - today...). So, please let me know if something is missing and forgive a bit of marketing copypasta for the moment.\\*¬†\n\nFor a larger breakdown of the different ASUS GeForce RTX 50 Series cards, please check [our previous thread covering the cards in greater detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1hw2osj/introducing_asus_geforce_rtx_50_series_graphics/).\n\nAlthough you can zoom below for the availability details, some of the information here in the FAQ may also be important for some of you. If there's something I missed or you think would help to add, please let me know below.\n\n**Q. Will these all be available on Day 1 as listed?**  \nA. We expect that most, if not all of these will be available at 6am PST for the US. Of course, things happen sometimes and a particular etailer or retailer may have a website issue or may be pending for stock to reach them. Feel free to ask later in the day and we can track this down.\n\n**Q. What about Canada Day 1 sales?**  \nA. We do know more about CA stock in terms of what we expect to be in store on Day 1 and what is on its way. Short answer is that Canadians may need to wait a little for our GeForce RTX 5090 cards, but there will be some GeForce RTX 5080 cards available Day 1:\n\nFor Best Buy (CA):\n\n* TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5080 OC Edition\n\nFor Memory Express and Canada Computers:\n\n* TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5080 OC Edition\n* ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5080 OC Edition\n\n**Q. When should we expect the rest in CA?**  \nA. The shipments are currently on their way, but will likely take between 1-2 weeks to arrive (expect closer to 2 weeks)\n\n**Q. Will there be pre-orders?**  \nA. Not with this launch. If this changes, we'll provide an update.\n\nYes, there has been some commentary about certain AIBs may be doing a pre-order, but it won't be before the 1/30 6AM PT embargo time. If we do pre-orders in future waves, we will try to provide this information ahead of time.\n\n**Q. Any information about waterblocks?**  \nA. ASUS is working with all major waterblock manufacturers in preparation for the RTX 50 Series launch. It's important to note that unlike the previous RTX 40 Series, each graphics card uses a different PCB and will not likely share compatibility for the same waterblock design. However, we don‚Äôt have anything further to share at this time and it may be better to contact your preferred waterblock maker for details..\n\n**Q. Any information about ProArt, Dual, White cards, BTF etc.? When is the next wave of cards coming in after this one?**  \nA. Sorry everyone, I had hoped to have more information about those questions by the on-shelf date, but I don‚Äôt have any concrete dates or times. Let‚Äôs instead break down the general range that we expect or know to expect for the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 (no spoilers for the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 just yet) ‚Äì\n\n* ROG Astral ‚Äì RTX 5090, RTX 5080\n* TUF Gaming ‚Äì RTX 5090, RTX 5080\n* ASUS ProArt ‚Äì RTX 5080 (no ETA yet)\n* ASUS Prime ‚Äì RTX 5080\n* BTF ‚Äì Stay tuned for now.\n* White Cards ‚Äì We will have them, but currently pending confirmation on the models and ETA. Stay tuned.\n\nAs we usually also note, we do listen to your feedback about what kinds of cards you want, whether you want to see more of a card series, additional white models (or fewer?), etc. Worst thing that can happen is that we choose not to take your advice, but we appreciate it and consider it for future models.\n\n**Q.

      "3099\n\nhahahahahaha\n\nno.",
      "MSRP is $2000 and you sell your card for $3000. $1000 for what? For your fat cooler and PCB? LMAO.",
      "Reserving this post for future stock updates.\n\nEdit 2/19 - I would have liked to update this more frequently, but graphics cards don't necessarily arrive in shipments like some of our other products do, such as monitors, which often come in waves - except for the first couple of shipments after launch.\n\nAfter the first couple of waves that have already come in, all of the initial etail and retail partners should have received stock and sold out.\n\nThe ASUS eShop should now correctly have links to all models that have been available, if you want to keep the pages open or bookmark them.\n\nAt this point, we're receiving shipments of our RTX 50 Series cards weekly and shipping out to etail, retail, and selling some through our eShop. For that reason, it's difficult to keep a running stock update for when you should expect to see certain GPUs or certain models at specific stores as stock will constantly be in transit. It's also important to remember that due to logistics, stores will receive stock at different times. Regardless, we are continually putting more cards into the channel, even if it still seems painfully slow for many of you. This means you just need to keep your eyes out for the model or models you want to purchase. \n\nI will also note that I'm still waiting to hear news about our white edition cards, ProArt cards, and any other unique models that we will eventually sell, but I have a feeling that we'll probably make a new post when these details are readily available.",
      "15% markup on TUF, 40% on the Astral base, and 55% on the Astral LC. Just... Wow.",
      "Why is it so expensive when it cools worse than the cheaper msi models?",
      "Hey Asus name cards Republic of Scalpers",
      "best buy lists the 5090 tuf that costs $1999 on their listings, will it not be available there?\n\nedit: I mean in the us.",
      "Generally, the cooling is very close from the initial reviews I saw, but it's a fair question.\n\nOutside of the cooling, if you take most of what I talked about above, and directly compared the MSI card, there are differences in terms of the build quality, a number of the included features (such as the PCB and 16pin sensors), even the number of thermal pads on the backplate. It's not that any one of the features jumps up and bridges the price difference, but the totality of the ROG Astral design begins to add up to the difference in price.\n\nThe other factor to consider is that the cooling performance in reviews is essentially a Day 1 snapshot. Over time, many factors come into play that will affect performance and cooling (such as repeatable build quality and design), and this is one of the reasons we chose to go with phase change thermal pads because it will provide the longest sustained performance and consistency among choices for cooling the GPU, not to mention easier for end-users to clean if they take the card apart.\n\nIt's a perfectly reasonable position to take that the MSI Suprim, for example, may be more to your liking because it's cheaper and seems to cool quite well in reviews, but I think the Astral cards also provide value for those looking for a bit more in an already expensive card.",
      "I don't know the stock quantity to be honest, and I wouldn't be able to disclose much detail if I did. Trying to gauge the first day of a new NVIDIA release is difficult, as even a lot of stock can sell out very quickly.\n\nFor restocks, I asked our team yesterday, but it's too soon to provide next restock information. However, I'll keep this post updated and I reserved a comment for stock updates, provided it doesn't get downvoted.",
      "Okay it still doesn't explain why the performance is so bad for the price. This thing should obliterate every other card for the premium",
      "Well, since you asked...\n\n**Card and aesthetic design:**\n\n* The ROG Astral uses a CNC-milled exterior on the die-cast metal shroud, frame and backplate.\n* Look closely at the shroud, frame and backplate to see how the card is able to self-sustain its shape with reinforced bracing while also protecting itself against torsion; essentially preventing sag while also providing integrity to the PCB to combat micro-fractures for long-term stability\n* Blacked-out heatsinks\n* Prismatic filter RGB Lighting\n\n**PCB Design:**\n\n* [The power delivery system is always much more involved on ROG cards to provide better power delivery and monitoring, including 80A MOSFETs](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-5090-astral/5.html)\n* Sensors are embedded in the PCB to track GPU, memory, and VRM temps and viewable in GPU Tweak III via the Thermal Map functionality\n* 16-pin PCIe power connector monitoring is included to verify that your power connector is fully-seated and can notify you even which pin is not seated properly in GPU Tweak III via a tool called Power Detector+\n* A conformal coating is applied to the PCB to help protect the card from short-circuits caused by dust, liquid, and debris\n* Let's not forget that the card includes a pair of FanConnect II PWM headers and two HDMI 2.1b ports\n* The GPU Guard also helps to keep the processor securely attached to the socket for long-term stability. Why is this an issue? With the size and length of cards these days, the weight can cause some level of bowing and microfractures inside the GPU socket, ultimately leading to failure.\n\n**Cooling Design:**\n\n* For brevity, I won't go into much detail about the quad-fans, vapor chamber design, heatsinks, fins, etc. because testing results already show that the ROG Astral is excellent for cooling - especially in comparison to the Founders Edition.\n* Phase Change thermal pads are used for the GPU, while others are trying liquid metal, combinations of liquid metal and thermal paste. This matters because the phase change thermal pads have significantly greater longevity than thermal paste does and is much, much easier to clean up than liquid metal paste if you ever decide to open up your card. Liquid metal can cool better, but not by much (and we tested), but is a lot harder to clean up.\n* Some of you may have also caught that we're using a thermal pad on the backside of the 16pin power connector to reduce heat during normal operation.\n* Speaking of thermal pads, the ROG Astral includes [more than a few on the backplate](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-5090-astral/4.html).\n\nThere are plenty of reasons that you might prefer the Founders Edition over the Astral, and we completely understand that, but there are also a lot of reasons to like the ROG Astral GeForce RTX 50 Series models, as well.",
      "GPU clock speed and price. I don't think we will update the clock speeds until after the sales embargo lifts later this morning.",

I don‚Äôt really care for multi frame gen all to much granted I‚Äôm sure it would be a cool thing. Used prices for rtx 4080 super and prices for the 5070 ti are pretty close.

      "5070TI all day every day, MFG is absolutely insane, im vibing on 4k RT PT 50 FPS baseline turns into 130+FPS and latency penality is not horrible at all",
      "some new games might start to skew the results to the rtx 5070 ti to being faster eventually, techpowerup did a benchmark on the last of us part 2 remastered and somehow it's beaten the 4080 and the 4080 super, it's only one test sample not much to say about it but it could indicate more things in the future.  \nBut really just buy whichever is cheaper they're basically the same card and has warranty for peace of mind.",

It is very comparable in performance now, and in future might go futher along with its much better ML performance, hardware Megageometry support, LSS support for RT/PT improvements, SER 2 ect.\n\nIn short - it is very comparable but supports a bunch of things that 4080S either doesn't support or has worse support for, and in due time those differences might become noticeable.",
      "It's hit and miss, 4x on darktide or hl2 rtx? Preem almost no artifacts and just makes the game run smoother, cp2077? I use 3x because it is smoother than 2x but ex just makes it a blurry mess",

      "Meh.  50 series v 30 series, then frame gen is worthy of significant consideration.  But single frame gen v multi frame gen?  Kind of a push, I think.  Frame gen is not useless,  at all, but it has significant drawbacks in terms of latency and artifacting. MFG is an incremental step up in both (more image smoothing, more artifacting, etc).  I don't think it's nearly as important as the other factors I mentioned.",
      "I know people like to just shit on AI frame gen, but I love 2x. \n\nHowever, 3-4x gets super funky in any games with high motion or first person POV.",
      "It also depends on whether the OP want's to utilize MFG.",
      "I personally don't see it at all but I guess it's different for anyone. For me personally 4x MFG was worth the purchase.",
      "I just got my 5080 yesterday. Honestly, I can tell it‚Äôs on but it‚Äôs really good and I think the smoothness helps out. It‚Äôs for my wife‚Äôs PC anyways and I really doubt she could tell much of a difference and would probably prefer the smoothness. I didn‚Äôt think it would be much of an upgrade from a 6900 XT but it definitely was.",
      "The main thing to me is FG is always touted as only being playable lag-wise with a base FPS of 60 FPS. So to take advantage of MFG which is at least 3x, you're really looking at needing a 165-180 Hz monitor to make use of it. My monitors are 144 Hz and my TVs are 120 Hz, so MFG isn't really useful to me without lag, and honestly, with a 5070 Ti, when will I not be able to hit at least 60-70 FPS in a game which would mean I wouldn't need any FG higher than x2?",
      "I would suggest to look out for 5070 TI MSRP if they‚Äôre around the same price. I was able to get one from Newegg 2 days back. But, if you get 4080 super for a good discount right now, you can get that.",
      "Here are my results on these. 4080 Super OC +185 +1000 110% Power Limit - 69.50 on Steel Nomad and the 5070 Ti +350 +1750 116% Power Limit - 69.84 on Steel Nomad. \n\nSame but different!"

That's roughly 50%. Now $1000 divided by $2000 is 50%. However, 512 bit bus and 32gb of vram here as well get doubled. \n\nThe first is a comparison between the 5070ti and the 5080. The second is a comparison between the 5080 and 5090. \n\nThe basic thing here is that a 5070ti is around 83% of the cuda cores of a 5080 and has the same vram, bus width, etc of the 5080. So, the 5070ti costs 25% less for 83%+ of the performance (likely to be an even narrower gap than 17%). \n\nMeanwhile, the 5080 to the 5090 is a literal doubling of cuda cores, doubling of vram, and doubling of bus width.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if the reviews dropped today, launch day, or if no review cards went out at all‚Ä¶ every single card available on release will sell out pretty much instantly. Nvidia doesn‚Äôt need to resort to tricks to make that happen, it‚Äôs how pretty much every GPU launch in the last 20 years has gone. By the time steady stock is readily available, everyone will have had all the time they need to watch every review. \n\n2. There may be a gap of a few hours between when the embargo drops and when cards go live for sale. I seem to remember this happening with a few past GPU launches. \n\n3. You don‚Äôt have to buy the shit day one. If you think a 5080 may be the right card for you, but want time to thoroughly research it‚Ä¶ take the time to thoroughly research it, and then buy it when you‚Äôve made up your mind. People act like when new tech drops, they must have it day one. Why? If you‚Äôre worried, just don‚Äôt freaking buy it. \n\n4. Review embargo‚Äôs are absolutely necessary and a good thing. Without them, you‚Äôd have a lot of publications focused on being the first to publish. It incentivizes doing a poor job to scoop up views. Embargo‚Äôs level the field and ensure everyone has the same amount of time to publish a quality review. That in mind, separate dates for the two cards also makes sense. This ensures publications focus on the 5090 first (which Nvidia obviously wants), and then the 5080 after. A day sooner would have been nice, but given that it‚Äôs already a short gap, I have a feeling that‚Äôs an every day counts sort of situation."

    "selftext": "So, while deployed to the Philippines, I had the good fortune of finding an RTX 5090 Aorus Master. It's their flagship card. Before buying I made sure to look at their Gigabyte Aorus Warranty (which you'll note is \"global\") which is linked here:\n\nhttps://global.aorus.com/warranty.php\n\nFor this card in particular, they offer a 4 year warranty. I registered the product with them and my product page shows my serial number with the warranty active.\n\nI've since returned to the USA, and the GPU has developed issues (crashing the entire PC no BSOD during gameplay). I have replaced PSU, Memtest 86'd the RAM, and swapped the GPU out with a friends 5080 and was unable to reproduce the crashes, therefore the 5090 is clearly the culprit.\n\nI tried to RMA the card, but the US website wouldn't let me go through with the web form (even though it let me register the product and gave me the 4 year warranty on this same subsidiary, screenshot of my warranty is included here). I called the service center, but was told that they would not honor the warranty as I no longer resided in the country I bought it from, even though the card is the exact same one that is bought in the USA, and all the cards are manufactured in China. I talked to the head of the service center in CA (the RMA center for Gigabyte in the US) and he would not budge, telling me that I'm pretty much out of luck. The Gigabyte Phillippines website does not offer an RMA option. This card is not even 2 months old.\n\nGigabyte DOES NOT HONOR their warranty and I now have a 3000 dollar paper weight because of this. DO NOT buy from them.

    "title": "RTX 4090 dies under warranty, won't replace it, what now?",
    "selftext": "[Resolved]\n\nSo, I bought an MSI RTX 4090 Gaming X Trio about 2 years ago, brand new, from MSI's Official Amazon pgae. My GPU has been working and being used correctly, (high quality PSU, no overclocking, ect.) Then about 2 months ago I had a serious problem and my GPU would spin up my fans to the max while my monitors lost connection but I'd hear sound.\n\n Long story short, after spending hours of my time diagnosing the issue and trying to resolve it, it was for sure the GPU at fault, so I paid $120 to have it shipped all the way to Sacramento to get it fixed, including the power cable. I got it back about a month later and put it in my pc and had the same problem within hours after they sent it back to me, put it in my Wife's computer and same issue. \n\nI called customer service back and told them of the issue, got it sent out about 2 weeks ago, and just got an email stating that it was unrepairable and not replaceable. They offered me some money back,  but not much, and said it wasn't going to be the $1,750 I paid for it because their \"3 Year warranty\" isn't actually a warranty, it's only prorated.\n\nSo, now I'm completely lost on what to do. I don't have the money I did two years ago when I was able to buy this card, and I figured it would last at least until the warranty was up (I've have Nvida and AMD cards for numerous years, and never once had a hardware issue with any of them). So what should I do? I can't get another 4090 as they are over $2,000 on the used market right now, and can't get the only card in the world that's better than it (5090) for obvious reasons. Even the 5080 is far worse than the 4090 and I'd still have to pay extra just to get that downgrade If I was even able to find one. I'm sitting here numb, at a loss. Is there any wisdom or help you guys could provide? Thank you very much.\n\n[Edit] \n\n- I just filed a compaint aginst MSI on BBB and FTC (heard back from only the BBB)\n- I also contacted the MSI spokesperson and emailed them requiring a replacement or upgrade (see resolution)\n- I also emailed Gamers Nexus like you all said. (no reply)\n\n[Resolution]\n\nSo, after a good couple of days after I made this post, MSI finally resolved my issue (as much as you can expect them too). About a day after I filed multiple of those compaints, they responded with: \"The RMA is unable to repair your card which is why we are asking if you are okay with the refund.\nPlease kindly share me a copy of your initial component purchase and I will check with RMA Dept if able to process item price refund. Thanks.\" \n\nAfter that, I sent them my recipt they asked for and I specified that I'd much rather a replacement 4090, but if that was not able to be done (it has been out of production for a few months) then I'd accept a 5080 or 5090. They then waited some more time before responding. The next time they responded was in response to the BBB contacting them and asking for a resolution, in the resolution they stated they already offered a full refund that I did not accept (They offered me hundreds of dollars less than a \"Full Refund\"). I then see in an email from the MSI spokesperson that they are going to: \"We will refund you $1748.99 as we do not have an equivalent replacements to offer\". \n\nSo, with that being said, I'll take that offer of a full refund, as that is what I paid 2 years ago. I spoke to multiple people at different times who told me that they had ZERO 5080s or 5090s in stock. Since, this resolution is more expensive than sending me a 5080, I'm inclined to think they are at least out of 5080s. This isn't the resolution I wanted, but it's good enough, as I'm tired of this fighting which isn't face-to-face, just screen-to-screen. I'd rather just have a 4090 back, but it looks like I'll be buying something different now. Likely getting an RTX 5080 with that money, or an RX 7900 XTX. They have somewhat similar FPS in most games and the prices are less than what I paid for my RTX 4090. Thank you all for the help and wisdom!",

      "\"isn't actually a warranty\" is an outrageous statement given they explicitly list it as a warranty and the warranty length on their own store.\n\nYou live in the United States, they are legally required to make you whole. \n\nIn this case that means either a refund for the original purchase price or a functioning product of equal value.  It's common for MSI to play these games where they'll offer you a lower end product or less money that what you are entitled to.  If you accept those offers, you agree to taking less than you could have gotten.\n\nLet them know you are entitled to be made whole and may else wise be forced to take legal action.  Post this on other social media to put pressure on them to make it right.\n\nAll else fails, if your account of the story is correct, this is an extremely easily win in small claims court.  You will likely win by default given the cost to pay someone to travel and lodge in your state likely exceeds the value of the replacement.\n\nThe other comments in this thread telling you to just move on and buy a different card are capitulary.

If you would like to verify the warranty term of the product bought, please kindly contact our local offices.\"\n\nThey don't disclose said extra terms and they don't even provide a number to call (easy to implement a region selector that provides the correct number) or link to where the person could even further inquire about them.\n\nThe thing is, under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, companies are required to clearly and reasonably disclose these terms to customers.  They are impeding customers from learning about these said full terms in three ways:\n\n1. They don't disclose them online or at the place of sale.\n2. They require you to call in to learn full terms.\n3. They don't even provide the number for said full terms (at least not where one would reasonable expect it).\n\nIt's beyond shady that they are hiding warranty terms to such a degree.\n\nI will note though that Gigabyte's warrant IS prorated (but at least they provide the full terms FFS):  \"If a Product is near the end of a given warranty period and a repair/replacement is not possible, GIGABYTE reserves the right to offer an alternative of equal or greater value or a partial refund proportional to the remaining warranty life of the Product.\"\n\nI'm not sure when this trend started or if other companies are doing it but consumers should push back against it.  Prorated warranties make no sense for GPUs.  GPUs are not consumable products that quickly burn through their life in the mere 3 year warranty period.  Most of my GPUs last 10+ years.

They'd be stupid not to do what they are doing.\n\nHaving said that, the consumer would also be stupid not to capitalise on former flagship cards being priced lower. Just depends on the individual needs.",

One gaming oriented and one enterprise oriented. \nThey can make silent rgb with lots of vram gpus for gamers that are a bit cheaper and bulky thermal optimized black gpus for enterprise that have more robust internal components that cost way more. That would help drive down the price for gaming gpus.",

In this case, they are referring to the Raster Operation partition. One (1) Raster Operation partition contains the eight (8) missing ROP units.\n\nAlso, if you want to check your 50 Series cards with [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/), below is the **correct** ROPs amounts from [Blackwell whitepaper](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf):\n\n* **RTX 5090** = 176 ROPs (Affected units have 168 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5080 =** 112 ROPs (Affected units have 104 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** = 96 ROPs (Affected units have 88 ROPs)\n\nWe have also seen [someone](https://reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1iwi18d/rtx_5080_missing_rops/) with 8 missing ROPs on his RTX 5080 as well. While the statement from NVIDIA did not mention RTX 5080, if you do have the same issue with any of the 50 Series cards, the path forward is the same and it is to **contact board manufacturers and** **RMA the card**",

it may therefore be disputed through other channels;\n\n>**Point 5:** It is true that no exclusions are indicated, and in fact in America even FE cards benefit from this code ‚Äì in our region, NVIDIA does not provide this promotion because it does not sell products directly but through LDLC, which is a vendor like any other and does not participate in this promotion in Italy ‚Äì this too is the response of those with expertise on the matter, and therefore cannot be contested via this channel;\n\n>**Point 6:** In Italy, LDLC is the only one selling Founders Editions, whereas in other countries the Founders Editions are sold by other companies;

Below I reply point by point:\n\n**01. The existence of the promo page does not prove that FE cards are included**\n\n>Correct: nowhere is it stated that FE cards are included.  \nBut it is also **nowhere stated that they are excluded**. The terms clearly state:\n\n>‚ÄúOffer valid for desktop systems or NVIDIA GeForce RTX‚Ñ¢ 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, 5070 graphics cards‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n>The Founders Edition **is** an RTX 5070. If there were any exclusions, they should have been listed. The absence of such an exclusion is meaningful.\n\n>Moreover, on the product page of the NVIDIA Marketplace, the RTX 5070 Founders Edition displayed the **‚ÄúDOOM INCLUDED‚Äù** banner.\n\n**02. The T&Cs only mention the territory, not the inclusion of FE cards**\n\n>Exactly: they neither exclude nor mention FE cards, but **explicitly include Europe**.\n\n>The fact that the promotion is ‚Äúvalid in Europe at authorized partners and resellers‚Äù implies that purchases made in Europe from such partners (like LDLC) are eligible.\n\n**03.

There is no guarantee your card will even be able to OC, when the 2080 Ti's came out I went through 3 cards , the first two were fucked and had to be returned and the third was stable but could only OC 30 mhz, that was it. That was all she had in her. Same case with one of the first two.\n\nYou cant go into buying a card expecting a certain level of OC performance. In my opinion the 5080 will be a very solid gaming card but the 4090 will reign supreme as the 2nd best card for the foreseeable future. Being stronger and having 8GB more of VRAM is just too good. Some folks need that VRAM for AI model/productivity work or games with large texture sizes/mods. If the 5090 supply is as restricted as they say, we may very well see 4090 values rise to $2000 on eBay. they are already at $1850.",

      "If it's 10-15% slower than the 4090 and the 5090 is 30% faster than a 4090, doesn't that mean this is effectively something around 55% the speed of a 5090?\n\nI remember seeing the downvote brigade here disagree with the idea that 5080 is roughly half the power of a 5090. If the leak is true it doesn't seem far off... given half the cores, half the bandwidth, half of...everything more or less.\n\nNote: i'm extrapolating for gaming performance, not time spy performance. Time spy shows different numbers than typical gaming fps outcomes. Note that 3dmark puts the 7900xtx ahead of the 4080 super but in the real world it is usually behind even the 4080FE in gaming."

The other, Virtual Key Light, relights the subject to deliver even lighting, as if a physical key light was defining the form and dimension of the individual.\n\nBecause they harness demanding AI models, these new beta features are recommended for video conferencing or non-gaming livestreams using a GeForce RTX 5080 or 4080 GPU, or higher. NVIDIA is working to expand these features to more GeForce RTX GPUs in future updates.\n\nThe NVIDIA Broadcast upgrade also includes an updated user interface that allows users to apply more effects simultaneously, as well as improvements to the background noise removal, virtual background and eye contact effects.\n\n# RTX Video Super Resolution Now Supports HDR & Is More Efficient\n\nAccessed via System > Video in NVIDIA app, RTX Video uses AI to enhance streaming video on all GeForce RTX GPUs. It has 2 features: Video Super Resolution (VSR), which removes compression artifacts, and sharpens edges when upscaling. And Video HDR, which tone maps SDR videos to HDR.\n\nIn the new NVIDIA app update, VSR has been updated to a more efficient AI model, using up to 30% fewer GPU resources at its highest quality setting, allowing more GeForce RTX GPUs to enable it.\n\nVSR now also upscales HDR video, so if you are watching any HDR video below your monitor‚Äôs resolution in your browser, it will automatically get upscaled to your native panel resolution.\n\nWe‚Äôve also added a GPU Utilization feature for RTX Video when Quality is set to ‚ÄúAuto‚Äù. Setting your GPU Utilization to ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù will use as much GPU as needed to provide the best quality Super Resolution available on your GPU.\n\nSetting the GPU Utilization to lower levels will reserve more GPU for games or creative apps by applying lower quality settings. Or alternatively, switch to Manual mode and set a fixed quality level to use at all times.\n\n# Advanced Optimus & Multiple Display Options\n\nThe NVIDIA app development team has converted, accelerated, and modernized two additional features from the NVIDIA Control Panel in this new release, with more on the way in the future.\n\nAdvanced Optimus enables a laptop to dynamically switch between using the GeForce GPU and integrated graphics. When performing basic tasks like word processing, the integrated processor is used. When GPU-accelerated apps or games are launched, Advanced Optimus switches to the GeForce GPU to maximize performance, to take advantage of high refresh rate displays, and to enable G-SYNC.\n\nNow, you can control Advanced Optimus in NVIDIA app from System > Displays. Open ‚ÄúDisplay Mode‚Äù, adjust as needed, then press Apply. With ‚ÄúNVIDIA GPU‚Äù selected, G-SYNC options and additional Display Settings appear, ready to be configured\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ky5qosi025ge1.png?width=2756&format=png&auto=webp&s=886ec3b0e7b9453a5720b23e7214c89963436ba6\n\nYou can determine if your laptop supports Advanced Optimus by going to System > My Rig, clicking ‚ÄúView Rig Details‚Äù, and scrolling down the list of items until you reach ‚ÄúAdvanced Optimus‚Äù.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mje5ct1b25ge1.png?width=2904&format=png&auto=webp&s=485da6455dd5612ca33b421541587690d135d25b\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel‚Äôs ‚ÄúSet up multiple displays‚Äù enables you to move the virtual position of connected monitors and TVs, select the primary display, and clone displays across multiple devices.¬†\n\nThese features can now be accessed from System > Displays in NVIDIA app:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ut70k3sc25ge1.png?width=2008&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d1447aa806f50e9f4584f3cce1327d82c105175\n\n# NVIDIA Smooth Motion Now Available\n\nNVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new driver-based AI model that delivers smoother gameplay by inferring an additional frame between two rendered frames. For games without DLSS Frame Generation, NVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new option for enhancing your experience on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.\n\nTo enable NVIDIA Smooth Motion, select a compatible DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 game in Graphics > Program settings. Scroll down the list of options on the right to reach ‚ÄúDriver Settings‚Äù, and switch Smooth Motion on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gztnvcvg25ge1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=f40ccdd2f981c58712ca5d421b12e67f4d9a64a1\n\nNVIDIA Smooth Motion can be applied to games running at native resolution, with super resolution technologies, or with other scaling techniques, typically doubling the perceived frame rate.\n\n# Feedback\n\n*To send NVIDIA feedback about any feature of the new app, please click the exclamation point to the right of the NVIDIA Overlay button*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0e687ovj25ge1.png?width=345&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e6f79cf96a34bf5a7917f7a4c95c80ba4ca4432",

Go to Nvidia App and you should be able to use new option, though if you only edit \"Disable\\_SR\\_Model\\_Override\" you have to use \"Use different settings for each DLSS technology\" option to make it work\n\n(I suspect that in most case, just removing `ApplicationStorage.json` file and restart PC and re-add game should fix it)",

Maybe they can get away with $1200+, but if it didn't work at all last time, I don't see why it would this time, especially since it didn't jump in VRAM or anything in terms of it being a better long term investment, and there are a lot of other issues going on in the world ATM.

My environment often gave problems to the FEs which had a hard time cooling memory.  The Gigabyte has also never had any coil whine.\n\nToday I was lucky enough to get a 5090 FE through Nvidia but I'm having mixed feelings because I know that the FE will be a downgrade in terms of noise and cooling.",

      "FWIW, I'm using a Gigabyte 5080 Gaming OC with the three-to-one 3x 8pin adapter. And, two of my adapters are from the same curly-Q off one of my Corsair HX850's cables. So I'm using 2x cables into the 3x. This PSU was from a good OEM when it came out, and the cables are rated to like 400W each, no part of the connector has been hotter than the case ambient to the touch under gaming loads. It has had absolutely zero issues pulling up to 430W or so under heavy benching with voltage cranked, runs cool n' quiet with an undervolt to .98-985V and clocks stay between 3150 and 3200mhz while drawing a lot less power under load, VRAM +3000.  \n  \nHighest temp I've seen the card get at under full power load was 74¬∫C and that was in max power, overvolted mode, running hard enough to get a couple of the \"highest scores\" for 12900K+5080 hardware on 3DMark 4K tests - I'm sure that's temporary, my 12900K is undervolted, limited to 225W and 90¬∫C tjmax, air cooled. An OC'd one drinking more watts should overtake soon. I think a lot of people haven't modded Afterburner to allow +3000 VRAM yet, is mainly the thing, plus good silicon on the GPU.  \n  \nAnyway. I think the connector issue has to do with improper construction on the adapter or connector, which major brands should hopefully be able to avoid. Quality of PSU included ones may vary to the detriment of the quality of the connection, though, and most of these cards have no load balancing or way to prevent longer term damage to an overloaded single connection within it. I felt it was safest to use the 6+2 pin connectors I know are good, into the well-made Gigabyte adapter, and it's working out.",

      ">If you already have a high-end GeForce RTX 40 Series card, then there is no reason to upgrade. You're just missing out on multi-frame-generation, the DLSS Transformer model is supported on all older RTX cards, too. On the other hand, if you're coming from GeForce 30, then suddenly you'll get to experience frame generation, which will make a huge difference for your gaming experience\n\nOverall this sums it up best - No reason for current 40 series users to upgrade (specially the same price bracket).",
      "Now imagine how bad the the 5070 will be with its specs...\n\nI'm really wondering if it even beats the 4070 Super.\n\nSeems like a generation to skip unless you are going for a 5090.",
      "I wish every 40 gen owner would think the same so I could upgrade my 3070 easily. But it'll all be sold out for the coming weeks no doubt.",
      "thats one of the worst gen to gen gains that nvidia pulled.",
      "Unlike the 5080 and 5070ti the 5070 has **16% less cuda cores than the 4070 super** meaning there's a real chance it won't even beat the 4070 super, or at least trade blows with it. So at this price you're genuinely only paying for FG",
      "Not being double the speed of a 3080 means I‚Äôm not upgrading yet. It would be even less of an upgrade for me since the 3080Ti is closer to 3090 in raw performance.\n\nEdit: It‚Äôs possible the 5080ti or super gets there.  I‚Äôll hold put and see what that‚Äôs like next year.",
      "If this was 24GB I would buy it. No way I'm spending 1200‚Ç¨ for a 16GB card, i would spend 700‚Ç¨ top for that.\n\nI'm skipping the 5000 series. Try harder next time, Jensen!",
      "Wow, didn't think it could be worse than releasing the RTX4080 at $1200, but this gen-over-gen performance uplift (for the xx80-class cards) lowered that bar even further. What a disappointment...\n\nOn the plus side, I now get to save $1000. xD",
      "hungry grey station aback jeans knee fine slim memorize hobbies\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*",
      "The fact that this card is a downgrade from the 4090, two years later, is a real disappointment.  Without a significant increase to performance or VRAM, it needed a price cut.",
      "I feel bad for people who sold their 4090 in desperation.",
      "Yeah most likely. I am coming from a 2070 super so will be a good upgrade for me.",
      "Wish my 3080 had more than 10g vram",
      "Pathetic, but on the other hand, it performs pretty well considering it's a 5070 in all but its name.\n\nTo make things even worse, people will still happily buy this, since, truth to be told, it's technically a significant upgrade from a 3080 in all metrics for instance and the best 999$ GPU on the market - well, assuming one can find it at MSRP or near that to begin with.\n\nIn fact, during writing this comment, I decided to make a one minute research, so let that sink: 3070 has more cores relative to 3090 (5888 vs 10496 -> 56%) than 5080 to 5090 (10752 vs 21760 -> 49%), the specs shrinkflation we're getting at this point is ridiculous, we might never 'escape Jensen'.\n\nBasically, they released the new '4080 12GB' but without the real 5080 this time, so people don't get mad again - thus nVIDIA learning from their mistake.\n\nThey did this specifically because they also saw people didn't like paying 1200$ for a '80' class card so instead they now sell a 5070 one renamed as 5080 for just 999$ which looks a lot more digestible.",
      "I can't believe this.  I have a 3080 FE and I'd expect at least 2x increase.  But 1.73?  Would I enjoy it - sure.  Is it worth the price?  Absolutely not.  This is why the 5090 is $2k+.  You're forced into that tier if you want to upgrade.",
      "I'm glad the new DLSS will help my 3080 last a little longer..\n\nI guess I'll wait for next gen.",
      "Yes the performance upgrade is meager but this is fundamentally a pricing issue.\n\nIf this card was $799 or even $899 it would have been much easier to swallow.",
      "and im one of the happy ones who bought of one these sad ppl.\n\nso for the sad ppl there is happy ppl",

      "Except with no FE, it will be priced too close to the 5080 FE not to just up a tier?",
      "Not really enough of a gap with the 40 series, despite the large core difference between the 4080 and the 4090 of 68% more, [the 4090 was only 20-25% faster or so in raster](https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-founders-edition/images/relative-performance_3840-2160.png). The only time you saw a bigger gap was with [RT enabled where it was more like 30-35% depending on the game for the 4090 in terms of a performance lead.](https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-founders-edition/images/relative-performance-rt-3840-2160.png)\n\nMuch of the prolem with the 4090 was that it was memory bottlenecked and the cores couldn't all be effectively used, I suspect this is also the case with the 5090 despite using GDDR7. Thats just a lot of cores and they need to be fed data quickly to be useful. Don't forget too, despite the memory bus being smaller on the 4080, it was probably more balanced or reached the sweet spot of memory efficiency, as in it had little bottlenecks in the computation pipeline. The 4080 and particularly the 4080 SUPER had faster G6X memory than the 4090 too. Had that faster G6X been given to the 4090 instead of the 4080, the gap would've been larger in favor of the 4090 since the cores could feed data in and out way faster.\n\nI think people are underestimating just how good the 5080 will be. Assuming the 5090 really is only about 25-30% faster than the 4090 considering the core count difference is around a 33% increase for the 5090 over the 4090 (of which architectures rarely scale linearly in terms of core count increase too) and the chart [NVIDIA has given us shows about a 27% performance increase in RT Far Cry 6](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwq919yvsolbe1.png%3Fwidth%3D960%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Ddbe652fc2d1e02ee2c74eff37251ab4b5bbad2f4). That means the 5090 is only about 50-55% faster than the 4080. That's not incredibly faster really, at least it's not like the jump in performance the 4090 gave over the 3090 and that was flagship vs last gen flagship, this is new gen flagship versus a whole tier lower from last gen. Kind of disappointing. Maybe the RT is holding the 5090's performance increase back and it's actually faster in pure raster, but I doubt it really, NVIDIA is probably showing best case scenarios of performance increase to really try and sell the GPU and as I said earlier the architectures rarely scale with core count increases, they tend to underperform.\n\nBut if we extrapolate the 5080 data, [we get 33% faster in Far Cry 6 RT for the 5080 over the 4080](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fd5thkxvsolbe1.png%3Fwidth%3D2644%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D79519f30f6366c139258a72feb316e32c98a9f01), assuming that maybe it's more like 20-30% because we should assume RT is a little faster than raster as probably thats where NVIDIA is getting big perf increases architecturally. So let's say it's 25% faster in raster, that puts us a little faster than the 4090, +/- 5-10%, probably more like 5%.\n\nThat leaves about a 20-25% performance gap between the 5090 and the 5080. Honestly, the 5080 is a no brainer at that point, half the price for around 80% the performance. There might not be room for a 5080 Ti in terms of performance, but there might be for VRAM.\n\nI mean just think about it, if they do make a 5080 Ti it would have to bring something to the table to justify the higher pricing, the gap in performance is kind of pointless for the price increase. With 40 series there really wasn't anything NVIDIA could give you to justify moving up, if you wanted more VRAM, paying $1599 for the 4090 versus the $1199 of the 4080 was kind of justified but only because the 4080 was priced so high to begin with. The pricing gap with 40 series just wasn't there to do a bigger VRAM card like a 4080 Ti and slot it in the product stack. If they did, what would it be? $1399? So they really couldn't do a 4080 Ti in the 40 series, not unless they bumped down the 4080 to $999 (which they did eventually with the 4080 SUPER but it took 14 months to do that) and tried to make a 4080 Ti at $1299 with 24GB of VRAM. But don't forget NVIDIA's original plan was to have a 4080 12GB and a 4080 16GB. The 4080 12GB was really a different die completely, which later became the rebranded 4070 Ti, neither of which were GB203. NVIDIA eventually also took all the \"bad\" AD102 dies and used them in China as the 4090D or as the RTX 5880 Ada, RTX 5000 Ada or L20's, some even ended up as 4070 Ti SUPERs (probably the absolute worst dies).\n\nSo the only justifiable reason for a 5080 Ti this gen is a VRAM increase and they could slot it in at $1499 with 24GB of VRAM becase to move a tier up in VRAM you have to spend double and buy a 5090. So I think that's what NVIDIA has done, they have priced the 5090 with a large enough gap to give themselves some room to slot in a 5080 Ti because last gen they really couldn't.",

      "This has seemed very likely to me the whole time.  If it were as strong as the 4090 it would trigger the Chinese import ban.

Incremental performance improvements that mostly track with price increases are way more typical.",
      "I know in the grand scheme the difference is minimal. But just on principle, the 5080 not matching the 4090 would be so annoying. Are gen on gen increases really that dead?

And back then the xx80 was said to be the flagship, the Ti and then later xx90 parts being replacements for the Ultra designated ones. But regardless, what I'm focusing on is that this gap leaves numerous spots for nVidia to insert parts. I'd be amazed if there wasn't at least one salvage part from the 5090. I'll guess that eventually nVidia releases both a 5080 Ti and a 5080 Ti Super. But if there's a 5080 Super with 24 GB of ram, that could be a best seller.\n\nP.S. It will be interesting to see what nVidia can wring out of this optimized but older process node.

    "selftext": "As the title states, I was doing some research on microstutters and such and after a while I found some old posts about this, and even a youtube video talking about it. Make sure to untick this setting -> https://imgur.com/a/DTS4jNj\n\nBasically, for some reason, if you monitor GPU Power you can get really bad 1% and 0.1% lows resulting in microstutters. At first I thought it was bullshit, but I tested in some games and 3Dmark as well, and well, it truly does run better when you turn it off!\n\nAs an example, in Total War Warhammer 3 I went from 112fps min and 143.9fps avg -> 127fps min and 167fps avg at 4k all settings maxed out. On top of this I ran some Port Royal as well, and I went from 36100 to 36716 with my 5090/13700k combo, having the card clocked the same +240core and +2000memory.\n\nI would love for other people to test this out and see if they gain any performance, if so, this needs to be adressed by either Nvidia, Microsoft or Afterburner.\n\nEDIT: Here's the youtube video I found/watched, creds to this guy for digging up old posts and sharing it on his channel [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQH3DYNboM0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQH3DYNboM0)\n\nEDIT 2: A lot of people are pointing out it‚Äôs the power % that‚Äôs the culprit.

I ordered it and it shipped via FedEx 2 Day. \n\nCome the day it is supposed to arrive the delivery eta keeps jumping up a few hours until finally the day ends. Then the next day (Friday) at around 10:30am it says delivered and signed for by \"L. SA\" which is not how I would sign/initial but it is related to my legal name. It isn't anyone in my household. It wasn't any neighbors nor the building manager in my apartment complex. I was home all day and nobody came to deliver it. \n\nI called Fedex and opened a claim but they really couldn't provide me more info other than it was signed for and that they would look into it.\n\nI was just wondering what should my next steps be. I tried finding a place to contact Nvidia but there didn't seem to be much info for support on orders from their site. \n\nI am also wondering if people who have ordered one of these priority access gpu's remember the box they came shipped in. I was just curious if it was very obviously a gpu because maybe that contributed to it getting stolen. \n\nFinally, I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips with dealing with Fedex.

Fedex will deny everything and just say they delivered it to the correct address (lie). Nvidia as the company you bought the product from usually won't push that hard and just accept that answer and will tell you that they can't do anything as the package was delivered to the correct address (wrong). \n\nSince this is such an expensive item I would just do a charge back if it plays out like this and they try to force you to eat the cost.",

    "selftext": "So, while deployed to the Philippines, I had the good fortune of finding an RTX 5090 Aorus Master. It's their flagship card. Before buying I made sure to look at their Gigabyte Aorus Warranty (which you'll note is \"global\") which is linked here:\n\nhttps://global.aorus.com/warranty.php\n\nFor this card in particular, they offer a 4 year warranty. I registered the product with them and my product page shows my serial number with the warranty active.\n\nI've since returned to the USA, and the GPU has developed issues (crashing the entire PC no BSOD during gameplay). I have replaced PSU, Memtest 86'd the RAM, and swapped the GPU out with a friends 5080 and was unable to reproduce the crashes, therefore the 5090 is clearly the culprit.\n\nI tried to RMA the card, but the US website wouldn't let me go through with the web form (even though it let me register the product and gave me the 4 year warranty on this same subsidiary, screenshot of my warranty is included here). I called the service center, but was told that they would not honor the warranty as I no longer resided in the country I bought it from, even though the card is the exact same one that is bought in the USA, and all the cards are manufactured in China. I talked to the head of the service center in CA (the RMA center for Gigabyte in the US) and he would not budge, telling me that I'm pretty much out of luck. The Gigabyte Phillippines website does not offer an RMA option. This card is not even 2 months old.\n\nGigabyte DOES NOT HONOR their warranty and I now have a 3000 dollar paper weight because of this. DO NOT buy from them. If anyone has any suggestions to actually get this thing fixed, I am open to them!",

I got it back about a month later and put it in my pc and had the same problem within hours after they sent it back to me, put it in my Wife's computer and same issue. \n\nI called customer service back and told them of the issue, got it sent out about 2 weeks ago, and just got an email stating that it was unrepairable and not replaceable. They offered me some money back,  but not much, and said it wasn't going to be the $1,750 I paid for it because their \"3 Year warranty\" isn't actually a warranty, it's only prorated.\n\nSo, now I'm completely lost on what to do. I don't have the money I did two years ago when I was able to buy this card, and I figured it would last at least until the warranty was up (I've have Nvida and AMD cards for numerous years, and never once had a hardware issue with any of them). So what should I do? I can't get another 4090 as they are over $2,000 on the used market right now, and can't get the only card in the world that's better than it (5090) for obvious reasons. Even the 5080 is far worse than the 4090 and I'd still have to pay extra just to get that downgrade If I was even able to find one. I'm sitting here numb, at a loss. Is there any wisdom or help you guys could provide? Thank you very much.\n\n[Edit] \n\n- I just filed a compaint aginst MSI on BBB and FTC (heard back from only the BBB)\n- I also contacted the MSI spokesperson and emailed them requiring a replacement or upgrade (see resolution)\n- I also emailed Gamers Nexus like you all said. (no reply)\n\n[Resolution]\n\nSo, after a good couple of days after I made this post, MSI finally resolved my issue (as much as you can expect them too). About a day after I filed multiple of those compaints, they responded with: \"The RMA is unable to repair your card which is why we are asking if you are okay with the refund.\nPlease kindly share me a copy of your initial component purchase and I will check with RMA Dept if able to process item price refund. Thanks.\" \n\nAfter that, I sent them my recipt they asked for and I specified that I'd much rather a replacement 4090, but if that was not able to be done (it has been out of production for a few months) then I'd accept a 5080 or 5090. They then waited some more time before responding. The next time they responded was in response to the BBB contacting them and asking for a resolution, in the resolution they stated they already offered a full refund that I did not accept (They offered me hundreds of dollars less than a \"Full Refund\"). I then see in an email from the MSI spokesperson that they are going to: \"We will refund you $1748.99 as we do not have an equivalent replacements to offer\". \n\nSo, with that being said, I'll take that offer of a full refund, as that is what I paid 2 years ago. I spoke to multiple people at different times who told me that they had ZERO 5080s or 5090s in stock. Since, this resolution is more expensive than sending me a 5080, I'm inclined to think they are at least out of 5080s. This isn't the resolution I wanted, but it's good enough, as I'm tired of this fighting which isn't face-to-face, just screen-to-screen. I'd rather just have a 4090 back, but it looks like I'll be buying something different now. Likely getting an RTX 5080 with that money, or an RX 7900 XTX. They have somewhat similar FPS in most games and the prices are less than what I paid for my RTX 4090. Thank you all for the help and wisdom!",

      "\"isn't actually a warranty\" is an outrageous statement given they explicitly list it as a warranty and the warranty length on their own store.\n\nYou live in the United States, they are legally required to make you whole. \n\nIn this case that means either a refund for the original purchase price or a functioning product of equal value.  It's common for MSI to play these games where they'll offer you a lower end product or less money that what you are entitled to.  If you accept those offers, you agree to taking less than you could have gotten.\n\nLet them know you are entitled to be made whole and may else wise be forced to take legal action.  Post this on other social media to put pressure on them to make it right.\n\nAll else fails, if your account of the story is correct, this is an extremely easily win in small claims court.  You will likely win by default given the cost to pay someone to travel and lodge in your state likely exceeds the value of the replacement.\n\nThe other comments in this thread telling you to just move on and buy a different card are capitulary.  All the big AIBs do this nonsense and just giving up encourages them to do this more.  Taking them to task will make them reconsider screwing their customers monetarily.",

      "Agreed, I'm not seeing anything that indicates it's prorated on their website: [https://us.msi.com/page/warranty](https://us.msi.com/page/warranty)\n\nThe first part of that page is crazy though:\n\n\"The warranty term differs from one region to another. If you would like to verify the warranty term of the product bought, please kindly contact our local offices.\"\n\nThey don't disclose said extra terms and they don't even provide a number to call (easy to implement a region selector that provides the correct number) or link to where the person could even further inquire about them.\n\nThe thing is, under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, companies are required to clearly and reasonably disclose these terms to customers.  They are impeding customers from learning about these said full terms in three ways:\n\n1. They don't disclose them online or at the place of sale.\n2. They require you to call in to learn full terms.\n3. They don't even provide the number for said full terms (at least not where one would reasonable expect it).\n\nIt's beyond shady that they are hiding warranty terms to such a degree.\n\nI will note though that Gigabyte's warrant IS prorated (but at least they provide the full terms FFS):  \"If a Product is near the end of a given warranty period and a repair/replacement is not possible, GIGABYTE reserves the right to offer an alternative of equal or greater value or a partial refund proportional to the remaining warranty life of the Product.\"\n\nI'm not sure when this trend started or if other companies are doing it but consumers should push back against it.  Prorated warranties make no sense for GPUs.  GPUs are not consumable products that quickly burn through their life in the mere 3 year warranty period.  Most of my GPUs last 10+ years.  GPUs are far too expensive and this is clearly a move to push customers to buy more often.  God i miss EVGA, screw these big corpa AIBs.",

    "selftext": "UPDATE 4: It seems that Nvidia is properly addressing the specific issue I encountered as described below for anyone else who is dealing with it. Mine seems to be an edge case. The more systemic issue appears to be credit card fraud prevention declining peoples' purchases and not providing them with an opportunity to rectify this while returning their already-in-transit GPUs to the sender and not providing the buyer with any opportunity to get back into the Verified Priority Access program. It doesn't have to be like this and Nvidia should seriously consider changing their purchasing process so that this doesn't happen anymore. It can't be cheap for them to ship GPUs out only to pull them back at the last minute.\n\nUPDATE 3: Received my replacement 5090 from Nvidia and all is well. Again, if you somehow encounter a similar issue and your payment has successfully gone through, just make sure to open a support ticket both at Nvidia Marketplace as well as at the normal Nvidia support site, that seems to be what saved me here.\n\nUPDATE 2: Just got off the phone with an escalation manager. He had been aware of my issue for some time and just waited for my refund to process before reaching out. Told me this was the first time he was aware of a situation like mine where FedEx sent back a GPU to them due to damage that they had shipped to a customer and that he'd be happy to process a new order for me. Order was processed and shipped out via overnight, I should have it tomorrow. Told him the support communication was not great up until that point and blamed Digital River but apparently Nvidia does all this marketplace stuff in house now and doesn't deal with them at all, and their support staff is still gathering their bearings. So if you have a similar situation and have a ticket open, just know they do actually look at these things. One thing I'd suggest is to open not only a ticket with the Marketplace support, but also through the main Nvidia Customer Care department and do everything you can to get an escalation.\n\nThanks to the Customer Care department for making this situation right for me!\n\nUPDATE: Not sure if it was a result of this post or not, but I am finally getting proper attention from Nvidia Support now. Should be getting a phone call from their escalation department tomorrow. Thanks to everyone for the upvotes, and hopefully this pans out and gives others in a similar scenario some hope.\n\n\\-----------------\n\nMy purchase went through just fine. It got shipped on 3/5 and I was charged. Package got stuck right before delivery on 3/10. FedEx claims it was damaged and will return to sender. I open a ticket with Nvidia Marketplace support. They claim I will be provided with a replacement RTX 5090. They go silent for days, and the item doesn't move per FedEx tracking. Then my order status disappears from the Nvidia Marketplace. Now I just received an email saying that Nvidia Marketplace is going back on their word and they will be refunding me.\n\nI have no option to get back into the Verified Priority Access program and I have been robbed of my opportunity to purchase a 5090 because FedEx destroyed mine. This sucks. u/NV_Tim bailed on us in the other thread and now I've been screwed out of the 5090 FE I earned through VPA and just because FedEx damaged it.\n\nSupport on 3/17:\n\n>Our team is looking into this, but we did not initiate a refund. Please be assured once we receive the damaged GPU, we will work on a replacement.\n\n>¬†  \nRegards,\n\n>¬†\n\n>Sandra\n\n>**NVIDIA Ecommerce**\n\nSupport on 3/19:\n\n>Your item is still in transit to our warehouse.

      "Probably better chance of running into Jensen at Walmart",
      "I absolutely changed my mind. Seeing the reviews presented three problems for me. \n\n1.) The performance isn‚Äôt there. I was hoping for more of an uplift. While a lot of my gaming would benefit from the MFG, I‚Äôm not satisfied with the overall performance increase. I‚Äôm on a 4080 Super, and it seems like a great value given the review numbers. The 5090 truly does feel like the 4090 TI. If I had infinite money, I would definitely upgrade, because why not. But I don‚Äôt. The cost for the level of upgrade is simply too much.\n\n2.) The FE model has the concerns I was worried about, including noise and temperatures. Everyone was gushing about how amazingly engineered it was before we had actual numbers. And while I agreed, I kept raising concerns about the actual performance. It seems my concerns were justified. Additionally, it‚Äôs going to be very hard to get, given that it is an online only release. I never had any plans to try to battle the bots. So the only card available at the actual $2000 price point is basically going to be unobtainium.\n\n3.) The AIBs are just too damn much money. If I‚Äôm not comfortable spending more money on what I see as a less valuable upgrade (5090 FE), there‚Äôs certainly no way in hell I‚Äôm going to spend more money still on the AIBs. The value proposition sinks dramatically when considering them. Given that the cost per frame isn‚Äôt fantastic to begin with, the AIBs just really make it worse. I was planning on going to Micro Center to camp it out, but I can‚Äôt in good faith raise the cost of this purchase even more substantially for even less performance. $3000 after taxes for a 30% performance bump is stupid.\n\nI‚Äôll admit it, I am bummed out. I expected a lot of this to some degree, but when all presented together, I just can‚Äôt make sense of the purchase anymore. I suppose in a way, Nvidia and all of the board manufacturers have done me a favor. I won‚Äôt have to camp out in a strip mall overnight worrying about peeing in a bush and getting mugged. But it is a disappointment.\n\nI‚Äôm either going to keep my 4080 Super or I will seek out a reasonably priced 4090. I probably don‚Äôt even need to do that. I just have the itch to upgrade after weeks of edging, and unfortunately, I think I just have to deal with a case of blue balls.",
      "i wasn't even tempted to upgrade my 4080 Super so after reading all this stuff it just reassured me that i'm not missing out",
      "Yeah, I was on the fence about upgrading to the 5090 from the 4090. I was assuming I could sell the 4090 and then put that to the 5090 but I think I‚Äôll hold off this generation. It looks like the 4090 will be faster than the 5080 so it really doesn‚Äôt make much sense to upgrade at the price point they are asking for. I was wondering if I missed something and somehow the 5090 was 50%+ faster than the 4090 but it falls short of that for sure. The only thing that is currently really making me consider it is the DP 2.1 for when 4k 480hz OLED panels become a thing. But I‚Äôll wait 2 years and get all of that expensive stuff then.",

I wasn't even aware that people bought gpus every generation. I'm not sure why we're focusing these reviews in that fashion. \n\nWe should be covering the jump that you're going to get from 2 series to 5 series. 3 series to 5 series.",

This one is now locked due to outdated title.\n\n\\-----\n\n**Update - February 25**\n\n**Full Article Here**: [https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte](https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte)\n\n**NVIDIA's Response Below**:\n\n>*‚ÄúUpon further investigation, we‚Äôve identified that an* ***early production build of GeForce RTX 5080 GPUs were also affected by the same issue***\\*.\\* ***Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement***\\*,‚Äù Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells¬†The Verge.\\*\n\n>*In response to¬†The Verge‚Äôs questions, Berraondo adds that ‚Äú****no other Nvidia GPUs have been affected‚Äù ‚Äî we specifically asked about the upcoming RTX 5070, and he says it‚Äôs not affected either. Nor should any cards be affected that were produced more recently: ‚ÄúThe production anomaly has been corrected,‚Äù he says****. In case you‚Äôre wondering, he also told us that* ***Nvidia was not aware of these issues before it launched these GPUs.***\n\n**Here's NVIDIA's Full Amended Statement**:\n\n>*We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.*\n\n\\------------\n\n**Full Article Here**: [https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue](https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue)\n\n**NVIDIA's Response Below**:\n\n>*Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells¬†The Verge*:\n\n>*We have identified* ***a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D and 5070 Ti GPUs*** *which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads.* ***Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement***. The production anomaly has been corrected.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Quick Clarification from me:**\n\nIn the response above, NVIDIA mentioned \"one fewer ROP\". In this case, they are referring to the Raster Operation partition. One (1) Raster Operation partition contains the eight (8) missing ROP units.\n\nAlso, if you want to check your 50 Series cards with [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/), below is the **correct** ROPs amounts from [Blackwell whitepaper](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf):\n\n* **RTX 5090** = 176 ROPs (Affected units have 168 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5080 =** 112 ROPs (Affected units have 104 ROPs)\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** = 96 ROPs (Affected units have 88 ROPs)\n\nWe have also seen [someone](https://reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1iwi18d/rtx_5080_missing_rops/) with 8 missing ROPs on his RTX 5080 as well. While the statement from NVIDIA did not mention RTX 5080, if you do have the same issue with any of the 50 Series cards, the path forward is the same and it is to **contact board manufacturers and** **RMA the card**",

      "What a shitshow launch tbh",
      "5070 Ti ?!?!?! \n\nThe plot thickens!",
      "Both 5090 and 5070 Ti are cut down dies. Given it doesn't affect the 5080, which is a full die, maybe something went wrong in the fusing off process to cut these defective dies down to spec.",
      "Buy a 50-series card for:\n\n\n- a rare chance of connector's melting.\n- a rare chance of capacitors blowing.\n- a rare chance of being underspecced.\n- a rare chance of having black screens.\n- an almost-certain chance of being overpriced.\n- a slightly-better performance than 40-series (relative to increased wattage-use).\n- incompatibility with the PhysX from Arkham Trilogy, Mirror's Edge, Borderlands etc.\n\n\nBest Generation Ever!",
      "They are quick to respond to this one while completely ignoring the power connector issue.",
      "The impact on an affected 5070Ti would be closer to 8%,¬† not 4%. This is obvious just by doing the math, despite Nvidia's statement. Losing 8 ROPs out of 96 is much more significant",
      "But why is the rop gone - Jack Sparrow",
      "People buying used in like 4 years are gonna get fucked over, and they won't even know.",
      "But they still shipped the faulty products??",
      ">> Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement.\n\n>> can  \n\nNice, Nvidia won't even warn consumers directly, you need to notice the issue yourself and then start the RMA process yourself.  \nThey're betting on people not noticing so they don't have to do shit.",
      "Dude, Where‚Äôs My ROPs?",
      "Bro this company is fucking screwed, like get your shit together holy fuck",
      "Driver issues.\n\nHardware issues.\n\nSupply issues.\n\nPricing issues. \n\nI'm not sure what a failed launch bingo is supposed to look like, but i think this is it.",
      "Production anomaly has been solved by not producing any more cards.",
      "I didn‚Äôt expect them to react this quickly. As it‚Äôs still dead silent about the melting issues.",
      "0.5% of all 5090s sold is probably the scalper cards to begin with so most people are screwed.",
      "Nvidia 3.2 trillion dollar company.  Does anyone know why they can't engineer or assure the quality of a safe, reliable power connector or a chip that has 100% of its advertised components active?\n\nOh, I think I can answer my own question - [gaming GPUs now only make up 10% of revenue](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/metrics/revenue-by-segment/), so they don't give a shit about the segment any more, and all of their focus goes to AI.",
      "I'm feeling really good about deciding not to upgrade this generation.",
      "Omg all those scalpers and people buying them are gonna get fucked if the seller bailed. Share these news so scalpers get stuck with them.",
      "Considering the value of Nvidia, their products and software are an absolute disgrace. To this day they still haven‚Äôt managed to produce consistently stable/performant drivers for their products and the quality vs price of the hardware is abysmal."

It's actually pretty big paradigm shift that'll pay dividends.\n\nShaders are generally something you have to optimize for, keep complexity low and games perform well. Neural shaders will let developers basically ignore shader complexity, and then package a fixed-cost NN with the game that isn't necessarily 100% mathematically accurate to the original model, but visually close enough at a fraction of the cost (and fixed at that).\n\nBasically, once this gets adopted, materials in games will take a huge step forward, that's not to say modern PBR materials in current gen titles are bad, but there is a huge amount of room for improvement, and being able to do those improvements in a fixed cost in a shipped product is a really good thing for graphics programmers.",
      "The standard Portal RTX settings bounced the rays multiple times, if I remember right.  \n\nPart of the point of a Neural Radiance Cache (or, well, all radiance caches) is to be able to terminate most paths early and just query into the cache at the end instead. You theoretically get less noise and better performance at the same time compared to a naive solution that always bounces rays the same number of times.  \n\nIt will still be heavy, for sure. But I expect it to be mostly fine on this gen and the high-ish end of last gen at the very least.  \n\nIn terms of Portal RTX, they're supposed to be updating it with NRC soon. Combine it with the new ray reconstruction models, and I bet performance / image quality could be pretty decent.",

This means technically, 5 out of 6 12V wires could be separated, and the card would request 600W as normal through ONE 18 gauge wire. \n\nThis is on top of the fact that the 12V-2x6 connector only has a 10% safety margin (600W nominal 660W peak) vs a 90% safety margin (150W vs [288W](https://help.corsair.com/hc/en-us/articles/10700487373197-PSU-How-to-Avoid-Current-Overload-Connector-Issues)) with the PCIe 8 pin connector.\n\nIt is 100% a design flaw, and there are multiple videos on the topic that dive into more depth than I do.",
      "They are 5% away on raw perro with the 4070 super even being faster in some titles, what‚Äôs so wild about the claim?\n\nDo some fact checking before spouting nonsense"

    "selftext": "EDIT: By request I tested Mirror's Edge and added the results below\n\nAs the title says, I bought a 3050 as a dedicated PhysX card in order to properly run some older titles that I still very much go back to from time to time. Here are the results in the 4 titles I tested, with screenshots where applicable:\n\nFirstly, proof of the setup:\n\n[Imgur: GPUZ](https://imgur.com/a/NOCaPj6)\n\n**Mafia II Classic results:**\n\nBenchmark run without the 3050 and max settings:¬†**28.8 FPS**\n\nBenchmark run with the 3050 and max settings:¬†**157.1 FPS**\n\nScreenshots:¬†[Imgur: Mafia II](https://imgur.com/a/USHApRq)\n\n**Batman Arkham Asylum results:**\n\nBenchmark run without the 3050 and max settings:¬†**61 FPS**¬†(but with MANY of the scenes in the low 30s and 40s)\n\nBenchmark run with the 3050 and max settings:¬†**390 FPS**\n\nScreenshots:¬†[Imgur: Arkham Asylum](https://imgur.com/a/pSLP1WJ)\n\n**Borderlands 2 results:**\n\n1 minute gameplay run in area with heavy PhysX without the 3050 and max settings:¬†**Could not enable PhysX at ALL**. I tried everything including different legacy versions of PhysX and editing .ini files, all to no avail.\n\n1 minute gameplay run in area with heavy PhysX with the 3050 and max settings:¬†**122 FPS**\n\nNo screenshots for this one since there isn't an in-game benchmark to screengrab, plus the test is very subjective because of that. But at the end of the day, only one setup is even allowing PhysX.\n\n**Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag results:**\n\nPlaythrough of intro without 3050 at max settings:¬†**62 FPS**¬†(engine locked).\n\nPlaythrough of intro with the 3050 at max settings:¬†**also 62 FPS**¬†(engine locked).\n\nIt seemed PhysX wasn't dragging this title down when using the CPU for PhysX. I saw the effects working as pieces of the ship were splintering off into the air as it was being hit by cannon balls.\n\n  \n**Mirror's Edge:**\n\nBreaking a few windows without the 3050: dipped to **12 FPS** and stayed there for 49 seconds as the glass scattered\n\nBreaking the same windows with the 3050: **171 FPS**\n\n**Other notes:**\n\nDespite setting the 3050 as a dedicated PhysX card in the control panel (screenshot below), it doesn't seem to be utilized in any of the 64-bit PhysX games. It seems the games are ignoring the control panel setting and just throwing the PhysX load onto the 5090 anyway. I tried several games and none of them were putting any load onto the 3050 despite PhysX effects being present on-screen. Hopefully this is a bug because I really would have liked to test the difference between running PhysX on the 5090 directly vs offloading it onto the 3050, with modern titles.\n\nScreenshot:¬†[Imgur: Nvidia Control Panel PhysX](https://imgur.com/a/TQiUc30)\n\nThe reason I chose the 3050 6GB is because it isn't cluttering up my case with more power cables as it just runs off the 75W the PCI-E slot provides, and I got a SFF version from Zotac that is a half-length card, so it isn't choking out the 5090 as badly as a full-sized card.\n\nPicture of the setup:¬†[Imgur: My Setup](https://imgur.com/a/LejdX1n)",

      "It's still so bizarre to me that China effectively shuts down for a *month* for new year. \n\nI get a weekend, or even a week. \n\nBut a whole month? Like damn. That can't be good for GDP",
      "Who hyped you that the launch was gonna be anything but paper? I don't think there was a single person on the planet other than Nvidia's marketing team MAYBE, who thought anything less.",
      "To be honest, all signs were there from the start. This was pretty obvious. I'm sorry, but it was super silly of you to sell a 4090, as 5090 isn't much of an upgrade. Sure, it's a bit faster, but doesn't worth all of this.",
      "Exactly. It's the same thing every launch. People sell their shit thinking they'll get in on the early queues. The reality is that most people will absolutely need to wait several months before they acquire a card. Alternatively, if they have absolutely _no_ self-control or patience then they'll buy from a scalper.",
      "Jensen is such a prick.",
      "Oh yes, Im sure supply will be completely normal in 16 weeks and no scalpers will buy those up too. This launch is a disaster.",
      "if a big store such as microcenter gets 200x 5090s for the whole usa, there cannot be more than few thousand 5090s in the whole world (europe got almost no 5090s, most of them are in usa). i bet nvidia is just holding onto them in local warehouses to ramp up the price and pocket the profits once the tariffs from china and taiwan become reality, nvidia doesnt care if they keep the gpus hostage for a few months.",
      "If I don't get a 5090 by the end of this month I think I'll just settle for a 5080. Have a 3080 but really would rather go all out if I can, but waiting 4+ months potentially would just be crazy. I'm using an Ncase M2 so I'm basically only looking for cards that would fit in my case. Really makes me wonder how many cards were even sold the last week.\n\n  \nKind of regret never getting a 4090 while they were out, just crazy how much Nvidia fucked everyone over this gen. I was on the Zotac store and when I refreshed every single 5090 sold out the moment it went up. I have a feeling that the Zotac store is so botted that it‚Äôs practically impossible to get anything from there."
